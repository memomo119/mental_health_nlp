aspergers,"  so let me start off by apologizing for my english, im not a native speaker and im working on it. I would also like to say that i dont mean anything which is written to come off as offensive or disrespectuful to anyone. Im 16 and just few moments ago i was furiosuly erasing the pencil marks some idiot left in the d.h. lawrences book i just borrowed. From the first glance i knew i just wouldnt be able to read it this way, i just cant focus on the words and its so distracting and hard to ignore. My mother walked on me doing that and after minute she just sighed and was like, sometimes i think you are autistic, are you not? is something which has been going on for about two years or so, just little remarks here and there. Its better now but they used to be more hateful and accusing, like beeing on the spectrum is some kind of desease and a bad thing. They are telling me im not normal for so long, that i can't properly say what are my personality traits, what is puberty speaking and if some of my behaviours are considered autistic or am i just a jerk in general. in need of some sort of, i dont know, advice maybe? I always thought autism is being diagnosed in the earlier stages of childhood. I mean it doesnt make sense for me to be autistic like NOW just from nothing? i decided to list some things i can find myself in based on what google is saying with addition of my own things i noticed im little different in comparison with people around me, and just let me know what you think i guess, if theres anything i need to be worried about or if my parents are just dicks, because im fucking tired of feeling like shit. of all i read people with Aspergers are strongly sensitive to textures, sounds and lights which i can really agree with. im fine with textures that is, but i detest heavy smell and loud noice and too bright light, its like i feel attacked and if its bad enough its hard for me to do anything even think, but mostly its just high sense of discomfort. I had a physics exam last week and my teacher just kept talking all the way threw it and my brain just felt so disoriented i couldnt read i couldnt understand what i just wrote and i felt so frustrated.... but idk if its related read it's common to have obsessions and routines and repetetive behaviours which is hard for me to judge because i have my schedules planned so tightly with ec acctivities that i dont really have space to do something not planned, i have however hard time dealing with unexpected changes of plans and activities which i didnt know about but im not throwing a tantrum because of it im just making sure everybody knows im irritated have my stories on my poorly handled eye contact hell yeah, but i've been said to im just lofty because of that... like once we've been being yelled at by our pastor for some inapropriate behaviour and i just kept looking at him you know. he was talking to us i was looking at him... and then he was still yelling and few minutes passed and i've been thinking to myself this is kinda long isnt it but i kept looking because i was like im telling him im listening.... and when he was finished i looked at my friends and they all have been looking down with their heads ducked down...and everybody was telling me i was acting super rude but i was like what did i do? definitely have hard time following orders and directions and i have issues with autority but for example im well rounded and pretty good at sports...and i wouldt say i have that much hard time when in social situtions. i mean i rarely talk but im good i think. But i have deffinitely troubles with relating to others emotionally thats for sure whether its because im on spectrum or not and i have terrible time controling my anger. think thats more then enough for you to understand im just pretty much listing stereotypes which i found on internet... but i just need to know, you know? more to everything of course but this is deffinitely too long of a post so just give me an opinion please? you have a better day than meHow do i know if I'm autistic?",1635426591,4064,772

aspergers,"I'm a suspected Aspie, and today I noticed (more like, I was criticized) that I tend to call out people's wrongdoings or sensitive information in front of others, and it's something I think I've always did. today I was in an online class with my study group, the teacher joined our room and I showed him what I was working on; everyone had to do something similar, so I said ""Yeah I'm done with this, I don't know about the rest of my group"" to the teacher, in front of my classmates. Turns out that by saying this I basically implied that the rest of the group hadn't done their part, and they criticized me for saying it. sure this is not the first time I do this, and I feel like what I said was fine, but I've been called out in the past for sharing sensitive information, or someone's wrongdoings, or anything similar that I shouldn't say out loud. anyone else ever has this issue?Calling out people in front of others without even realizing",1635423058,946,176

aspergers,"OK, guys. Check this out. Last year, I was diagnosed with ADHD, and in preparing for this diagnosis, I was watching Russell Barkley videos on ADHD. to Barkley, kids at school, with ADHD, are often rejected, permanently, within just 20 MINUTE. have also been watching some videos lately from a former ecret ervice agent, who said that first impressions are everything, and that most people will form an impression of you literally within ECOND. want you to think about something here. if, someone came into your workplace, and they claimed to have autism. And they then said, this is why I am crying with unstable emotions. This is why I am ""slow"" at picking up the job. This is why I get to wear these noise-cancelling headphones, and don't have to bother listening out to anyone in the workplace. imagine, if someone with autism, said that this is the reason that I am slow in the workplace, because of my ""autism"", and that you are ""discriminating"" against me, and even then, bring in some government workplace accomodations legislation, and sue the company to the ground, etc. you see what I am saying here? say, that you had a crazy mother. And your mother would hit you, and shout at you, and threaten to kill you, or was a drunken alcoholic, or something like this. your mother later said to you, hey, son, I think that I might have ""autism"". And I am going to go to the psychiatrist, and hey, these ADHD stimulant medications actually can work well for autism, as well as ADHD. hey son, remember all those crazy times we had together? Remember the time I held that knife to your throat? Remember that time I got home one day and just started smashing flower pots randomly or punching your father in the face? son, now, I have my ""autism diagnosis confirmed"", and I ""have my medication"", so now, you can trust me, right? Right? you would really be quite a crazy person, to then trust your mother at this point. now you see, how it makes sense to reject someone within 20 minutes of erratic behaviour. Because once you've seen someone act crazy once, how do you know whether they are ""faking autism"" or ""really genuinely have autism""? for example, is one of the easiest diagnoses of all, to fake. College students are known to fake a diagnosis, to then get their ""smart drugs"", to help them do better in the college work, essays etc. similarly, I think would be quite easy to fake. They do ask for things like, often, school friends, or parents, or someone, to confirm that you displayed these behaviours while at school. with ADHD, there is no such thorough investigation, and they pretty much give out Ritalin like candy, really. The irony is that those who are faking ADHD, actually find it easier to get a diagnosis, than those who really have it. For example, I remember myself, lacking the attention span, to even organise an ADHD diagnosis in the first place, over 10 years ago. And finally 10 years later, I re-discovered ADHD again, and this time, I actually got diagnosed. this is the problem. We are not mind readers. fact, let's say, that somebody even did invent, a mind-reading device. then, you can now learn how the mind-reading device works, and then trick the mind-reading device itself, and be ""one step ahead"" of the mind-reading device. is no such way, to ever tell, if a person is lying or not. This is also something that I learned, from watching videos from this former ecret ervice agent. so there is, quite literally, no way to ever tell if a person is lying. can, for example, match up details of what someone is saying, to some other source, or multiple other sources, that say the opposite. But from this, you cannot say that the person is LYING. You can only say that what they are saying is NOT TRUE. But not that they are DELIBERATELY lying. is literally NO WAY to ever tell if a person is LYING! example, I watched body language videos, saying that people tend to put their hand on their chin, and rub it, when they are lying. To touch the face in various ways. OK, but notice how, I have watched a video on such a thing. Thus, in the future, when I am lying, I could then, deliberately NOT place my hand on my chin, so as to not give it away. the point is this. I am very suspicious overall, of ANYTHING that takes too long. example, I believe there are 2 aspects to achieving anything in life. is: The formula, strategy, rules, barriers, routine. This is something that you might have to think through, and strain your brain, stress out your brain, temporarily, to work out the formula. This stress is a one-time thing, where you learn it once, and now you have learned it forever. Maybe a refresher course every now and then, but basically, once you've learned it once, you;'ve learned it for good.2. The work itself. OK, so let's say you have mapped out and designed your go-kart racing track. Now, you simply have to race through the track. This work is repetitive, it is tedious, it involves no thought. You can do it almost entirely on cruise control, on ""autopilot"".  literally, in my estimation, EVERYTHING in life works based on this formula. this is why, people will reject a crazy person, within just 20 minutes, or often have their first impression of you, formed within literally seconds! is because, if they had to keep re-assessing you, each day, to see if you have gotten ""more crazy"" or ""less crazy"", that they now have to strain their brain to do so. is what is known as ""checking"" behaviour. This is a core, common problem of autism. Where you cannot be productive, and focus on your work, because you are stuck in ""checking"" behaviour. would be like, if you were trying to speak a foreign language to someone, but you haven't learned the language properly. Thus, in the middle of conversations, you have to keep bringing out your French book, to look up the translations. This then slows down the entire conversation to a halt.  this assumes that the other person has patience or trust in you, that you genuinely don't know French language. But what if you are actually just DELIBERATELY wasting their time?! What if you actually DO know French language, but you are just breaking out this book, to waste their time, just to slow them down, just because you are a parasite, an infiltrator, a psychopath, a sabotager. these people do exist. I know that autistic people are said to be ""honest"", and  ""innocent"", and ""gullible"", and ""couldn't believe there would be bad people in this world"". But the world, MUT work on the opposite assumption. It simply must. a public setting, such as, the streets, the city, the workplace, the school classroom, the school playground. In these public settings, you MUT assume that it's more like a ""war zone"", and everyone is out to get you. Thus, you must be dishonest, and you also must be efficient, and quick.  this is a boxing match, and now is not the time to re-assess your boxing strategy, while you are getting punched in the face. You should throw in the towel, for now. Then, go home, re-learn your strategy. Then, sign up for another boxing match, and hopefully this time you win. do people with autism do, and ADHD? They start a boxing match, they are losing, they are getting punched in the face. They then try to re-assess their boxing strategy, as they are getting literally punched in the head. Wow. How could you do that? That's dangerous. You are possibly going to die or get seriously injured. No! You must throw in the towel! would be like, if you applied for a job, got rejected. And then, you came back the next day, to do yet another interview at the same company. And then you got rejected again. And then, you came back the next day, and did another interview. I actually do kind of wish that the world of work, worked like this. It would be better for autistic people. It's all about being quick. There is no such thing as ""work"" which is prolonged. There is no such thing as work that is prolonged. human brain can only hold 7 things in its working memory at once. 7 things.  human long-term memory can hold, 100s of things potentially, millions of things, billions even. I have no idea how many things it can hold. This ""hard drive space"", I don't know how many ""TB"" in size it is, but it is WAY bigger than your ""working memory"", your ""RAM"". computer metaphors that I am using, these are NOT metaphors. Many scientists believe that we will LITERALLY place computer chips in our brains. Computers don't just work LIKE human brains. They quite possibly work EXACTLY the same as human brains. This is not to say that we don't have a ""soul"" or ""God"" doesn't exist. But that the brain itself, really, can be studied, precisely as if it is a computer. I see no reason that the brain can't be fully studied and understood, just like the human heart, hands, or any other mechanical part of the human body. There is no reason that scientists cannot create a replica of the human brain, and import it into computer software, and create a full replica of your brain, inside of a laptop. It is called ""working memory"" for a reason.  computing terms, RAM is also known as...? WORKING MEMORY word.... WORKING memory. it comes down to actually DOING things, it is going to happen quickly, impulsively, repetitively, and more.  you cannot, every time you encounter a ""bully"", re-assess this person to see if they have ""improved"". You just can't.  you are supposed to do, is not go in O DEEP with a bully, that you have to flee the workplace, the neighbourhood, the city, even the country, even the planet. your own parents, your own family, your own siblings. This is the one social scenario, where you have NO CHOICE. You have no choice which family you were born to. And actually, to a large extent, the same can be said for school. human being, basically starts off their life, in very odd social scenarios, which do NOT resemble how it works in the adult world AT ALL. example, you are born into your parents, and you have no choice over it. Unless you really want to go into foster care, and damn, look at some of the horror stories there. example, your parents choose which school you go to, and often, the government chooses which school you go to. Thus, if you fall out with all the kids at school, which we often do with autism, then you're ""stuck with it"". You MIGHT be able to convince your parents to go to another school, but it's doubtful. I once screwed up my school early on, in childhood. I asked my mother to move to another school, and she said no. are highly unlikely to be able to change, which school you go to, and which parents you are born into.  people are highly individualistic, highly creative, don't like to be told what to do, and don't naturally follow social norms. Nothing we do socially is intuitive. are, with autism, the guy who walks up to the bully, and tells him how bad of a bully he is, and then, you've just pissed off the bully even more. And you get the whole damn school bullying you, and then, some of these autistic kids even then shoot up the school. Clearly this is not the answer. There is something in autism, called ""object permanence"". means, whatever is hidden from your field of view, you no longer believe exists. It is like playing ""peek-a-boo"" with a baby. And when you hide behind your own hand, the baby thinks mommy has literally vanished. at school often have psychopathy, which also involves object permanence problems.  for example, how a school bully, often bullies you, the very second that you walk into the room. Whereas, they certainly didn't though, come and track you down, and bully you, prior to you entering the room. domestic abuse for example, many victims believe, that once they flee their abuser, that this abuser will stalk them, track them down, and thus, there is no point fleeing. The evidence shows, this is NOT how it works at all. In fact, if it worked like that, the entire human species would be dead by now, or we would all be in a big concentration camp or controlled North Korea style society, if everyone was just a relentless psycho who tracked down their victim, even after they fled the house. see, once you have discredited yourself to enough people, you simply have to leave. so, how do you prevent yourself doing that? You don't go too deep down the rabbit hole with them. you stick to this rule, that everything in life must be QUICK. example, I've noticed, that if I am looking at a person who I am scared of, that simply closing my eyes, and the fear goes away. have found, that if I simply turn my back to the person who I fear, that the fear goes away. That is, unless I can then hear their voice, in which case, covering up my ears would be the solution. autism, it is actually, very conveniently, FAR easier to get out of abusive situations, than you might realise.  my experience, you can literally use this very same ""object permanence"" issue, in your own favour, to get yourself instantly, out of any abusive situation. was once living in a domestic abuse situation. When I faced inwards, into the abusive house, my fear was high. Especially when I was going to bed at night, and I would sleep in the bed, facing the inner house, looking inwards through the bedroom door, into the hallway. one day, I simply turned my body around in the bed, and instead chose to face the wall of the house instead. The fear instantly went away. Like, nearly instantly. It rapidly reduced and reduced, until it was gone. might think, this is dangerous, because if it's an abusive situation, then, surely you would WANT to face the inner house, to ""check"" for the abuser, to then, fight off the abuser, if they were to attack you.  no, this cannot be the answer, because you can't predict if you will win a fight anyway. you turned your back to an abuser, what if they were to ""stab you in the back""? hold on a minute. Why would they suddenly stab you in the back, just because you turned your back to them? wouldn't they have already just stabbed you in the front? is not a boxing match anyway. It's not like you are stuck in the ring with them, or stuck in a prison cell, and they have a knife. You are not actually boxed in, with this person, at all. if you take an ADHD stimulant, it raises up your entire nervous system. You feel fear more, if you are in an abusive situation. I took an ADHD stimulant, last year, while living in an abusive situation. found, that when I face the inner house, that the fear was high. when I faced the walls of the house, the fear was low. literally a 2-second solution to abuse. could you be in ""checking"" behaviour, if you are not even facing the inner house, to be ""checking"" in the first place? can you possibly predict when someone is going to abuse you? example, what if they were to attack you in an entirely different way? For example, they could get you from the window of the house? They could even burn the entire house down? They could even phone the police, and claim that you hit them, and lie, or collaborate with other abusers to do so? how this works? is quick. o, the solution there to abuse, is a 2-second solution, where you face the outer house, rather than the inner house. in social situations, they've shown that people judge you within seconds. in the workplace, you are supposed to know what to do on day 1. They don't allow ""autism"" as an excuse for why you are slow, unless they are understaffed and desperate. But you can only keep that up so long, before they say that you're not getting any faster, and fire you. to do with formulas is slow, fine. There are inventors in human history. Albert Einstein didn't come up with his theories within seconds. This took him years etc. Fine. Formulas, writings, strategies, these can take a long time for sure. the actual work itself, and it should always be a ""final product"". has to be a quick final product, because of how the human brain itself works! The human working memory can literally only hold 7 things in at once!The average human will permanently reject you within 20 minutes",1635405995,15993,2890

aspergers,"Eng is not my first language.For context, I (F) have started college this year and still live with my parents. I've suspected I have autism or adhd (inattentive type) for almost two years, maybe both. I know getting a proper diagnosis as a woman can be difficult, but the symptoms do really resonate with me. However the time I brought up ADHD, my mum dismissed it and even said it doesn't exist. Also, some family members have made a point about me possibly having autism, but my mum dismisses it too.The reason I would like to get a diagnosis (even if it turns out  I don't have asd or adhd) is because I'm really struggling with mental health and college, also, I've always felt different and that would explain why I feel this way.

aspergers,"Just wanted to share my experience today, because if it were me in the past, I would've brushed it off and lingered about the incident on and on, but at least I did something.  was at McDonald's with a friend and I ordered a meal with Poutine (search it up if you don't know what it is, and if you do, you can tell I am from Canada 😂). I ordered at the kiosk with the touch screens and as I was waiting for my order, I can hear one of the employees grunting and being pissed, saying like ""ughhh who ordered poutine again?!?"" I can't remember the rest after but I know she sounded annoyed and at full rage and it was disrespectful, considering the fact that I COULD HEAR HER and look at her expressions almost close to each other. I was actually super livid because she was just ranting this out loud when I can hear her and see her. Our distance was not that far from where she was standing. I was then told by another employee that ok, we can't make the Poutine right now because our machine broke or something, so I just said to replace that with regular fries.  holy shit I got the courage to tell that employee that this lady working was rude as hell. I kid you not, I had to hide and not look at that employee behind the fries after I said that, because I did not want to act up on this employee. (Mind you, I was on the verge of going up there screaming and having the urge to punch her, but of course, that's not a good thing to do). After I did what I did, my friend comforted me and just told me stuff like oh if it were me, I would've left and cried.  felt guilty though calling the employee out because I have no clue what she was going through today and what got her riled up. It's ok to rant about not having the Poutine, but in a way where you are lashing out about it when there are no walls between me and you, it ruined my day for sure. I am just super happy I told one of the employees and gave her a piece of my mind. Incidents like these are also MAJOR reasons why I hate asking people for help, or not socializing easily with people. The more I experience them, however, the more I feel at ease about these types of situations.

""you get used to it"" which breaks my heart to hear, because I love the big guy, I know he doesn't want to be as he's often asked about my friends, he even asked if there was somewhere he could go to make friends, and I thought of Reddit as there can be some amazing, cool people out there, after a little subreddit searching, here I am. doesn't use social media, as well, no friends means not having anyone to chat/see posts from etc, not to mention he's highly protective about where he gives his information, but I thought it might be a good idea to direct him here in an attempt to try to help him get some social connection, because god damn it he deserves to know some nice like minded people! into cool stuff like; anime, gaming, 80s/90s cartoons, gardening, drawing, geeky shows and films, like not to be bias, but if I wasn't his brother, he'd seem like a pretty cool guy aha.Plus god damn the guy loves a pun of bad joke 😅 long story short, if anyone wants to chat to a geeky, kind, passionate guy, please do reply to this post, it would be a great help! and maybe give him some willingness to try knowing there are people out there who feel the same way/enjoy similar things. just want to know my brother will be happy!

aspergers,"Before I’ll explain, I’d like to say I’m most interested in answers of adult-diagnosed aspies (everyone’s welcome here though, I just want these people to mention this fact). How your views on being alone have been changing throughout your life; before getting diagnosed and after. here you go: Choice – _I’m alone because I have chosen not to maintain relationships at expense of my own self. Or just because I like it this way._ Consequences – _Loneliness is just a price of my irregular behaviour. I am the one guilty for isolating myself._ Fate – except for _I was born like that, it’s just isn’t in range of my capabilities_, here I also include: _I just wasn’t given an opportunity to meet people that truly understand me or that I feel comfortable with_ choices allowed as well, as I mentioned earlier: i’m interested in different answers over time. Respond as you please, if you wish break it down like “90% choice 10% fate”. my case, it is: currently choice I received an assessment from a professional, it would certainly be the “consequence” for me.  even most NT’s are often cringing over some random past memories of their own before falling asleep, but back then there was no day that I wouldn’t be literally HAUNTED by my brain playbacking some relatively embarrassing situation. And by concerns what these people that I have interacted with might be currently thinking about me, did they notice the “creepy” side of my personality, did I forget to discipline myself in a certain moment. entire base of friendships (and also my first romantic relationship) was built on forcingly pleasing and interacting with people of my age, even if we shared absolutely no common interests and deep down I didn’t want to have anything to do with some of them.  have even performed some manipulative acts in order to maintain these relations on emotional level, but actually I never enjoyed playing with anyone (it straight up sucks and shouldn’t be done on purpose). I just wanted no one to be hurt by discovering the truth and remain in my illusionary comfort zone thought that it was just the price of not being alone. And that it’s not _normal_ to be alone. receiving an elaborate explanation of AD from my doctor, I have slowly started regaining my self-acceptance, even though i’m still really far away from it. For one thing to be sure, I’m finally happy because of being alone. I’m still socialising or having some low-key crushes, but I never push down deeper when they begin to drain my energy. I guess that makes it my choice then. was always a “fate” factor that I considered to be present even now. I just believe that I haven’t met my soulmates yet, but one day we’ll finally get to know with each other. ame for my significant one. this, there’s a kind of an amusing situation. My ex-girlfriend sometimes likes to mock me as if I was waiting for my “fictional perfect romantic partner with whom I’ll achieve eternal happiness without putting any effort into relationship”.  was never offended when she claimed this in our post-breakup dialogues, but she clearly misunderstood the whole thing. he told me that she never demanded much from me – I just had to empathise and regularly small-talk &amp; text with her. Of course I didn’t manage to fulfill such _simple tasks_. I, on the contrary, wanted to finally take a rest from both of these if someone would be that close with me, and it had nothing to do with any lack of interest.  the end, I also don’t demand much – I just don’t want to feel exhausted in long term nor worry about getting caught off-guard.In your opinion, are you alone because of your fate, own choice or consequences?",1635385182,3655,639

aspergers,"First of all, I'm only talking about the idea of sex because I never had sex before, but maybe in the future who knows? Anyway, I'm someone that masturbates nearly everyday, I usually fap to a picture of a nice female butt, and today I suddenly had this thought, what would it be like if I weren't like this? When I was a kid I def found the idea of sex to be gross, but still liked the idea of love though, like having someone that you find attractive more than anyone and having them all for urself, I always liked nice female butts even when I was a kid, but not sex. But now as an adult, I started thinking, what if sex didn't exist? And that's when I found out how I actually feel about life, life is really hollow to me, and whatever things I do, like playing a game or the desire of finding a good job, although they are fun and beneficial for my own life, deep down I have that thought that's like ""hopefully this would impress a girl enough to love me"", yeah there's alot of things for me to explore in this world, things i can create, but without that ""hopefully this would impress a girl one day"" thought, it just feels meaningless to me, maybe something is wrong with me for feeling this way? I don't really feel any connection with anyone irl, and kinda like it this way because that means no responsibilities. so in the end, I feel like this desire for sex is kinda what keeps me going in but I won't know for how long and what's going to happen. Everything about sex is just appealing to me, mostly because of how aesthetic a female body can be, and having it all to yourself. I'm only thinking all these because I hope there's a better way of existing rather than feeling like this?How I feel about sex",1635347011,1718,330
aspergers,Long story short I've had it pretty dang rough the past two years and ive started developing a problem where now when I get upset enough it feels as if my brain shuts off and I really do start to act sort of like a child... I cry uncontrollably and half the time i really do feel desperate for peoples attention...i feel like i need help but Its embarrassing to admit and any other times I act way mature for my age. People even tell me I do which is why they are so shocked whenever I have a meltdown..(I'm 18). I live on my own and have been recently having a lot of issues with my family leaving me and finding better friends. My s/o and I recently got back together and he's been under a lot of stress because of some familly issues recently and I hate that at times I really do get on his nerves because of my emotional managment problems. I am going to see a doctor soon but unfortunately I got my health insurance cut off so ive been unmedicated and without therapy for a good year now and I've also most likely also developed PTD according to my sister (she's a nurse practitioner). I am nervous because most meds ive tried dont seem to work very well and we cant really afford extensive therapy right now as we're desperately trying to save up for a better place to live (our roommates aren't the best people) I don't really know where to go for advice so I'm hoping someone here can at least relate somewhat :/Anger issues...?,1635345760,1436,273
aspergers,"o I went to a therapist and she told me asperger is not on the autism spectrum and is totally different. I must say I am biased, due to horrible abusive experience with an autist in my early childhoo, making me think all autists are like him, making me therefore - hate them. I have been diagnozed with adhd twice but my therapist says I barely have anything with them. I am annoying. Rarely had friends. Have a big kink about rules. ee in black and white and miss the grey. truggle with social cues. Loud sounds and touches cause me severe physical pain. I thought this oversensitivty was part of being adhd. I always knew I was different but could nto verbalise it. Unlike me, the autistic guy I knew, constantly screamed, attacked his mother or anyone near him, went in the oven to hide there, hit his head on the wall, seemed brain dead most of the time until he started screaming. I called him - the monster. And if that may sound unempathetic I just wanted to mention that I am highly empathetic, I just didn't like him with his screaming and touching and not talking at all. I went from hyper talkative and annoying to hyper quiet. I went from looking at my feet to looking at people in the eye...or staring. For both, I was shouted at. I also had a big thing for ''correcting'' people, it didnt matter if they had a defect or said the wrong historical year, I didnt know I was annoying and hurtful at that time but i realized it and stopped doing it. I don't like parties since the lgihts and sounds caused me pain so I always left early.  had severely bullying to the point of wanting to kill my self and stopped washing or eating. People rarely liked me so I altered my personality and people pleased as a way to survive. Anything to avoid being hit, slapped or insulted. I rarely had any social success even though unlike autists who have no social interest, I did have an interest. I do understand sarcasm and it hurts quite a ton, like any insult. My emotions overwhelm me and drown me, but since I was laughed at and attacked for expressing them I supressed them, until I lashed out, or developed severe depression, and it is a cycle I don't know how to get out of.  biggest flaw is talking and ranting too much without giving the other the chance to talk, probably be naive and see in black and white. Is this how people with asperger work? I know asperger is different before the age of 18 and after it, since young people have more severe symptoms and I sure did, but now I have more self discipline and am less ''annoying''. I try my best to actively listen and look people in the eye and not be a ''horrible'' or ''rude '' human being. I have always tried my best but always felt like it was my fault and I messed up, which made me refuse to take any resonsibility for my self at some point.

It seems to be about being able to cross boundaries of authority because some social barriers aren't even visible to me.  ome examples would be a civil war reenactment group, star wars cosplay, authority figure like a cop, a doctor or some kind of performance or theatre production I'm not actually in, even just an employee of a corporation. not unusual for me to just jump into situations to fix problems and people just assume I belong there.

We explained where we are at in life, he said he's being lazy and trying to find a job and I told him in trying to get my license and what I'm planning on doing for a living. All started because I told him that I missed him and he said he misses me too lol.  I was talking with my mom and she said she would be able to get him in somewhere. he has been wondering why he hasn't been around as much as he was I just told her we have been figuring life out and he's just being weird about things. o I want to message him about this opportunity I have for him but I keep thinking about the bad we had as friends. I would only really message him this opportunity because I still care about him and want to see him succeed despite our differences.  really do miss my bro and he's explained he misses me too but I just dont know if I should message him or take this opportunity away from him. Petty me is like don't talk to that bitch he doesn't deserve it but the nice friend who still cares wants me too message him that. I'm trying to trust my gut but idk what its telling me I'm thinking he'll find away to fuck this up. I told him we need to rebuild our trust again and maybe me offering him this will help him get motivated to do it. so torn either I be a amazing friend or I be a cold hearted bitch.

aspergers,"I'm 36F and moved back in with my parents a couple of years ago. I know that I often treat them badly by taking my frustrations and stress out on them or snapping at them or being sarcastic. I don't want to do these things, but it's not like I'm doing them on purpose so I don't know how to gain enough control to stop. I read that autistic people sometimes feel emotions more strongly and have a harder time thinking logically when they're feeling strong emotions, so I feel like this plays into it. Disclaimer, I am self-diagnosed but on a long waiting list for official assessment. this kind of thing doesn't really happen around other people because masking kicks in, though that's also not really intentional or voluntary. And I think I have other issues that I need to work on in terms of how I interact with other people. first I want to be able to treat my parents better, and I don't know how. I feel like when I get stressed or upset, I end up snapping or shouting or saying mean things, but it just happens before I've even realised what I'm saying, or it's an instinct that I can't overcome, where I need to say something to release my anger or stress. It certainly doesn't feel like I'm choosing to do it or have any control over it, so I don't know how I am supposed to stop.  sometimes it's my parents who start things by criticising me, and I don't know how to be the bigger person and not get angry in response.  connected issue that I've had with my parents and close friends is that if I'm feeling bad (depressed or stressed) they seem to want me to keep it bottled up, not talk about it and pretend to be happy. This feels like lying or masking to me, which I do do around people I'm not close to, but it would make me very uncomfortable to do that around people I am close to. o I'm not sure how to do that, or whether I should.How can you become a better person when the bad things you're doing are unintentional/involuntary?",1635234784,1947,369

aspergers,"When it comes to those with autism, I was wondering if there is frustration because, even though many of us like to feel it makes us differently abled or just thinking differently, when looking at them as a group there will naturally be more inherent limitations. example, nowadays for NTs, it is often considered the norm or at least not uncommon to be able to work as a full time B.., M.. or PhD student while working another full time job or at least part time job and in some cases doing that while having a family.  And have passions in sports or the arts on top of that they embrace. If we were to take a sufficiently large group of NTs and a group of those with autism, for the autistic group there would be drastically fewer who would be able to manage that.  Or would be able to manage, for example, getting a 3.5 higher gpa in college while at the same time working a separate full time or part time job.  Outliers among those with autism, certainly, and deserving of being celebrated.  o to be sure, this is not speaking in any absolutes. But far less proportionally if we're talking populations of those with autism vs those with NTs. do those with autism manage feeling adequate and even having a sense of pride in light of this?  Is it based on this being an example of a sort of hustle culture that they learn to get over?  Perhaps out of necessity, because judging their worth to society by ability to engage in hustle culture would, for the majority, not work out particularly well?Do you often find that balancing multiple priorities such as school and work together would be too difficult to manage and so feel inadequate relative to NTs who have capacity to balance them together?",1635228364,1700,309
aspergers,"I wrote this recently, to amplify the point that an autistic guy doesn't need resources or conventional value to be attractive, etc. I agree, and it's also true that a guy doesn't need a high level of looks, money, OR status to find decent partner. There's other attractive qualities to cultivate, such as passionate interests. I'm glad someone is talking sense here. is a true statement, obviously.  All anyone has to do is look around... lots of guys who are none of those conventional things are with good woman.  ome of those guys are bound to be autistic, in addition to lacking most or all those things.  There are other qualities--including intangibles--that can make up for it.  That's my point. folks here want to antagonize reasonable, true and optimistic statements with lies.  The crux of it being, ""Either be an NT guy, or be an autistic man with status, and that's the only way""--mostly because of their own insecurity.  Because of their own rejection sensitivity.  Maybe also because they were indoctrinated in a very angry and delusional belief system, which has been debunked hundreds of times. on point, since I don't like putting anyone on the spot, I won't name anyone.  But someone replied to my original comment saying this:  ""If you don't have those 3 things, then you need to be tall.  Yeah man woman only want 4 things, status, money, looks, or height."" off, that comment is unacceptable here. then, no one has ever been able to prove something like ""there's only 4 traits women want, if you lack all of those 4, you will not be wanted unless you gain one of them.""  This is ridiculous.  And if you believe such a thing, you've already lost--regardless if you actually have conventional status symbols, or not. truth is, autistic men don't get partner cuz they lack 3 or 4 traits, but mostly just because they don't try.  You could be jobless with crappy education (it happens to many of us) and still have partners, provided you still went out and tried. this utter lack of effort is usually from rigid thinking:  ""ociety says guys who don't have an adequate job aren't wanted,"" or, ""society says short guys aren't attractive"" or whatever.  ome guys who lack all 3 (or 4?) traits end up thinking to themselves, ""I have nothing women want, therefore I'm defective, and must be dateless virgin for life"" and this is tragic.  Because none of it is true! yes I'm addressing the negative types dragging themselves and others down in this.  If you're the type who looks at a couple and thinks, ""that short guy losing his hair obviously has a great job, otherwise he'd never be with her"" you actually need help. Because that thinking is disturbed.  And yet that's the *exact* type of thinking I see here.  You know better.

I would try to go get help, but I live in the middle of nowhere and I have no way of leaving my house.  past year has been hard for me, I was in my last year of secondary school (high school for Americans) and I was bullied for being autistic.

I ended up having a mental breakdown and I didn't do my exams, so now I have no way of going to college or getting a job.  given up over the past couple of months, I quit doing my hobbies and now I don't even shower, I know it sounds gross but I have no motivation anymore as I feel like just giving up at life. My parents don't care that I have been wearing the same clothes for weeks, they just pretend like it's not an issue. I tried talking to them on multiple occasions and it went so wrong. They're really religious Catholics and they told me that it's a sin to have depressed thoughts and then got mad that I'm ungrateful about my life. They made me go to confession for being depressed and I was told to just pray if I want to get better. My mother started blaming my problems on the video games I play, and put holy water around my room. I don't know how to reason with them.  have no idea what to do, I'm so lonely and I have no friends to vent to. I have the social skills of a toddler, and eye contact is impossible for me. I feel like I'll never make friends. I see other young people having fun with friends and doing things like going to college, learning how to drive, etc and I have none of that.

I earned a B.. in IT and am working a good paying job, as a network engineer.  In school, my parents helped me so much on assignments; projects and essays in particular. This was from elementary school til my sophomore year of college at a community college. On top of that, they spent roughly $2,000 on tutoring sessions for me. Also, it was very easy to cheat on most  of my assignments at a community college and *I never had any timed essays.* chool, aside my Dad also did alot to fulfill my interest in IT, which started with working with me on building a PC when I was in 4th grade.

aspergers,"I don't know if this is an aspie thing, so I thought I'd ask. My whole life I've been a very ""particular"" person about my material possessions. When I get a new phone, Fitbit, headphones, PC parts, movies, games, consoles, TVs, monitors, literally anything, I have this urge to always, no matter what, use only the cables that came with it unless it makes no logical sense, and when it doesn't make sense, I store the OEM cables with the box the product came with. example, I just bought a new Fitbit Charge 5, I don't like the watchbands so I ordered new ones. The old bands go back in the box, and the box goes in my closet with all the paperwork/extras, including protective films and everything. It just feels right to keep everything I bought together. I'm not a hoarder either, when I get rid of things, I get rid of the extras too. The old Fitbit Charge 3 I had, the box, and everything related to it is already in a box to donate/giveaway/whatever to friends or family who want it. do this with literally everything even when I am not using all of it, I have a box in my closet from one of my monitors, inside is all the original packing material, manuals and original cables it came with (my setup required buying dedicated 10ft cables). Repeat same for all my PC parts, my gaming consoles, everything.

aspergers,"If you're allistic (non-autistic) with an autistic friend, parent, sibling, classmate, bf/gf, husband/wife, coworker, roommate, etc., and you see this, here's how you talk to and understand autistic people: BE DIRECT. It couldn't be emphasized enough that when you talk to an autistic person, being very direct is the way to go. You don't just be direct, you sometimes have to explain in a lot more detail about how you're feeling, what you're doing, etc. Also don't expect them to pick up on abstract language easily either such as idioms or metaphors. Autistic people's brains are hardwired to not pick up on subtle cues, lies, or abstract language easily since they are naturally literal/concrete thinkers. On the flip side, as a result of this type of thinking, autistic people are often very honest, loyal, and trustworthy.2. Know what focused interests and info-dumping means. If you go to an autistic person and see them spewing a long lecture about facts about their interest, don't just assume that they're ""egocentric"" or that they're ""selfish"". In fact, they might actually be wanting to be friends with you! When autistic people talk to other people that they're interested in, they usually drop the small talk and move on to the big talk since info-dumping to autistic people would mean conversation of substance rather than talk like weather, sports, etc. They would think that you would probably be fascinated in what they're interested in.3. Be aware of sensory differences. If you know in any way that they're autistic, just ask them about what bothers them so you could be supportive to your autistic friend. Generally, autistic people tend to be more sensitive to things such as sound, light, texture, smells, temperature, and pain. Autistic brains take up an extreme amount of detail to the point where too much can turn into a meltdown. In fact, autism is sometimes called ""intense brain theory"". Don't take them to loud places without permission or force them to wear uncomfortable clothing or they could have a meltdown! No is no. When you ask them about what you could do to help them, not only are you being helpful, they would love to hear about it since it shows that you're being a good friend.4. Don't suppress stims. Do not just think that an autistic person has the ""mind or thought of a child"" just because they use their fidget spinner or rock on a chair. You would just be pathologizing and stigmatizing autism even more by doing this. timming for autistic people is their unique way of expressing emotions and letting out sensory stimuli. Again, autistic people process sensory stimuli differently and emotions as well, so if you force them to suppress their emotions or sensory stimuli, there would be an embarrassing meltdown! For example, when an autistic person hand flaps or rocks in their chair after like winning the lottery, eating chocolate, or listening to their favorite music, the autistic person is most likely happy.5. Don't mistake lack of eye contact for anything else. Just because they don't make eye contact doesn't mean they're ""creepy"" or that they have some secret agenda such as ""becoming a school shooter"". As in other points stated above, autistic people's brains are very often extremely detail-oriented and monotropistic which means that their tunnel vision is very intense so eye contact to them would be the sensation of getting stabbed. In fact, if you don't force eye contact upon them, in their mind, they're going to pay attention to you better.6. Don't expect them to show emotion or tone the way you do. Autistic people may not show emotion or tone on their faces very often, so don't judge them as some ""robot"" or ""psychopath"". It's just that autistic people show it differently as previously said in number 4 that autistic people express their emotions through stimming. If an autistic person stims when they see you, they must be happy to see you! Autistic people even experience emotions very deeply. However, alexithymia is very common in autistic people though, but it doesn't mean they don't experience emotions, but they would just have lots of trouble recognizing what their own emotions are.7. Don't assume that they lack empathy. Again, if they do not respond the way you guys do like through faces or words, they might just be reacting in a different way. In fact, an autistic person might even have hyper empathy. Keep in mind that autistic people can also have no empathy, but just like anyone else, they can have extreme empathy or no empathy at all. Usually, an autistic person might also seem to ""lack empathy"" while not actually lacking because autistic people have a very hard time relating to your experiences. Actually, this goes in both ways too. Autistic people have a hard time understanding allistic people while allistic people have a hard time understanding autistic people. This is known as the double empathy problem. Because autistic people and allistic people have massive differences in thoughts, interests, preferences, personalities, and more, it is often very hard for the two parties of mixed neurotypes to understand each other's experiences since their brains are vastly different. The way the double empathy problem can be broken down is by you guys asking autistic people about how they experience life while they ask you back about how you guys experience life. That way, even though you guys might not always relate to each other, you both could at least learn from each other's experiences and develop deeper connections. conclude this, the problems that autistic people have are not mostly as a result of being autistic themselves but because of society since autistic people are the minority and are expected to fit in. o the deal is if autistic people have to constantly learn how to understand you guys' way of interaction and thought processing, then you guys have to also learn about how you would understand autistic people's way of interaction and thought processing. Just think about how you guys would feel if you were the minority while autistic people were the majority. Therefore, we can bring peace to allistic and autistic people and end the crises that autistic people experience, and we can coexist peacefully! you're reading this as an autistic person though, tell me what do you think of this guide.

aspergers,"I'm not diagnosed, but a bunch of people have suggested that I may have AD and I'm inclined to agree. Either way, I have a bunch of problems: some are symptoms of AD, some are not. Apparently I have trouble reading social cues but I'm so blind to them that I'm blind to the fact that I'm blind to them, so others had to tell me. It's just embarrassing and frankly, it kind of turned my world upside down. Just, great. I already knew I that I can see so much less, do so much less than most people, now it turns out that I can't even recognize social cues properly. guess I better get used to it. What's next, I can't taste properly? My understanding of the English language is incorrect? Is this all a bunch of gibberish to you guys, and I've been misinterpreting all these symbols? Honestly at this point, that's probably the case. Where does it stop, man? What aspect of my being is going to be left alone, uncorrupted by this awful disease of uselessness, the way I was born? Nothing, of course, because I am the disease. I should've known. This extends to every aspect of my life, and there's only one guy to blame. the problem, you know? The world doesn't discriminate, it just makes a *ton* of people. There's nothing that carefully selects the characteristics. Just make every possible combination. A bunch of them work. A bunch of people are talented and have bright futures ahead of them. But then there are the ones that don't work, the leftovers. The group of defective ones, and the universe doesn't give a crap what happens to people like me. It just created me and went ""oops, that was a mistake. Guess that's your problem now, good luck with that."" seems weird, you know. It feels borderline unethical for me to even be saying these things, but I don't make the rules and believe me when I say that things would be different if I did. But it's the truth, and unfortunately there's no way around it. This sucks. wait for the comments! A bunch of self esteem ones, probably. Maybe some people who think they can change the course of my life by suggesting self-help books or therapy or some YouTube video that says we're all special in our own way. Life doesn't work like that, though, and we all know it. Life is cruel. Life creates a bunch of useless people who can't function properly, who can't have a shred of dignity, and then just leaves them that way! We are all unique, but a ""unique perspective"" isn't always valuable if it comes about because of a lack of understanding of the world. I only see things in black and white, and sure, the picture in black and white is certainly different from color. But there's a reason there aren't a whole lot of black and white movies being made anymore. The color picture offers more, and I offer less. now, as a leftover, I'm wondering what to do. I'm not going to find any answers, of course, as I am a leftover after all. It's hilariously awful, the situation I find myself in. This wasn't supposed to happen like this, yet it did, and now the consequences fall on me. I've got the full set: ambition, check. Needs, check. Desire for dignity, check. Ability to fulfill any of that and not be a useless moron. Ch- OOP. Forgot that one! Well, have fun without it, and good luck! Just kidding, screw you! Have fun being an overgrown child for your whole life! - incerely, the universe.  mean, what the heck man? is there to do but make self-pity posts on social media? Chasing happiness and fun are fine and all, but there are two types of people: people that understand that they can't function with that alone, that need to feel important, significant, like their role in the world is one they can be proud of - and liars. Humans aren't built to experience what I'm experiencing but the universe just tries a bunch of things without caring that many of them will fail. can put in a lot of effort but I can never be a respectable person. It's like a kid putting two Lego blocks together: the adults will all say they're proud, because it's good by the kid's standards, but in reality it's not really very remarkable. The pride of the adults doesn't come from a place of respect; the standards are low because there is very little. It's okay for the kid to be simpleminded and clueless because they're a kid, but they're not meant to spend their whole life like that. They need some dignity too, and it usually comes when they get older. I never grew into a respectable person, I'm still a clueless, dull child because of my stupid DNA or whatever it is that caused this. probably just using this as an excuse to cry ""woe is me."" Actually, scratch that, I definitely am. But, it's true though. It's not sad, it's just terrible in how *cold* it is. orry if this isn't the sort of thing that's welcome here. I'm just really frustrated and don't know what to do. sure why I'm posting this in this subreddit, specifically. I guess it's because of the social cue thing, but that's really just the straw that broke the camel's back. Idk, it's just crazy to me. omeone told me that ""reading the room is not my skill,"" the most recent of many who told me similar things, and I just don't get it. I didn't realize I couldn't do that properly. I don't know why I'm so blind, the social cues are just the tip of the iceberg.

I had almost all the videocassettes and DVD, and made sure to be on TV whenever it aired. an adult, I moved to other media that are more appropriate for my age, obviously. But I've gotta admit, upon accidentally watching one episode a while back (the same used for a YTP I had just watched), I noticed that, unlike other childrens' shows that aired where I live at the time (unless you count Dora the Explorer, which I rarely watched), it always followed a very ritualistic narrative, like this : The opening sequence* The Teletubbies saying ""Eh-oh"" to the camera or doing a short activity* The TV Event* The main segment featuring the Teletubbies doing something in relation with the TV event* Depending on the episode, a ""magical event"" or dance sequence* Transitions featuring the baby sun and shots of Teletubbyland inbetween segments* And finally, ""Tubby Bye-Bye"" I can see why a young Aspie like me was addicted to this show : it was always the same formula for every episode, more or less; ""Teletubbies"" seemed like a routine. And to be fair, the surreal nature of 'Teletubbies' was always fascinating to me, and sometimes scary (didn't really like it whenever there was the singing puppet event or lion and bear). wonder if TV shows with a narrative pattern like this one were especially popular with Aspies or people with AD...About ""Teletubbies"" and similar TV shows...",1635195918,1441,247

aspergers,"Hi all!  the title says, I recently started realizing that a friend of mine whom I occasionally interact with (we're both highly introverted and self-reserved, and generally antisocial) may have some form of mild autism. I'm really not what it is though, and I'd like to ask some help from you guys to identify it. An obviously easier and more straightforward option would be a psychologist of course, but my friend doesn't like or trust medical professionals, and she doesn't appreciate to be told about the possibility of her problems being rooted in a mental condition. I feel bad for her because doesn't have any friends (though I consider myself one she more than once expressed that she doesn't even know what friendship really means), and as things are going at the moment, I worry she might lose more than she can handle before turning to professional help. If any of you know the best way to approach people like her, let me know please, I highly appreciate any thoughts or insights!  should list the unique and striking characteristics which may indicate what's ""off"" about her, or what contributes to her seemingly unsolvable peril with the whole world outside: he's 22 now, I knew her since she was 17, and probably the most curious thing about her I noticed, is that she haven't aged the slightest over the last five years. I myself am someone who appears much younger in looks than my age, but in her case, it's like she's stuck in her 15s, her looks, her speech, her thoughts, her memories, all resemple that of an adolescent girl's, much more so than one would expect. Understandably she often complains about not being taken serious by her peers mainly because of it.  he's highly sensitive to emotions. Few people I know experiences emotions with such depth and magnitude like she does, to the point it can cause her panic attacks, at least by her account. he perceives everyhing through certain emotional filters. What's also interesting, is that though she verbally expresses these things, her face is unreadable most of the time. I witnessed her laughing five times total since I knew her, and I never once seen her shed a tear. he's never been in love, it appears to be an impossible thing to her since love isn't always peaceful and pure. he sometimes feels the attraction towards certain people but she cannot internalize it, and gets conflicted instead. The longest relationship she had lasted about three months, only because her boyfriend refused to acknowledge that she cannot return his feelings for her, and she was too insecure to end things herself.  Despite being highly emotional, she doesn't understand other people's thoughts or emotions, unless they are highly relatable to her. he's intelligent, she has at least above average intelligence, but she has an obvious weakspot when it comes to processing the world around her, especially people. I'd go as far as to say that she's incapable of understanding certain concepts about the human behavior, her black-and-white perception of things have remained the same ever since we first talked. For example, emotional states that contain both ""good"" and ""bad"" feelings like melancholy, gratification, pride, thrill etx appear to her as simply ""bad"", avoidable at all costs.  he has an obsession with the idea of goodness. In her view an existence tainted with imperfection (suffering) is an existence wasted and unworthy. he doesn't express it in such ways per se, but she has nonstop perils and complaints with people about all of them being bad and cruel and life not being worth living because there cannot be perfect equilibrium. he obsessively and exclusively seeks the feeling of ""oneness"", the state where there's no differentiation between her experience and everyone else's.  he's highly idealistic, naive, and stubborn. Because of this, and the above mentioned reasons, she continuously over-idealizes people all the time, then gets disappointed. he makes everyone become mad of her over time, as people (myself included) get frustrated due to the difficulties of getting anything through to her. he doesn't suffer from any form of speech impairment, in fact she speaks clearly and adequately, but she takes forever laying down a thought, often walking in endless circles being unable to arrive at a conclusion or the next sequence. Nevertheless she loves to express her thoughts, hours upon hours she can talk if she finds a subject willing to listen, and can quickly turn overwhelming to almost anyone who's not prepared.  he sometimes feel broken, but more often she thinks that the world is broken around her. he cannot understand nor accept her own thoughts or feelings that she doesn't perceive to be perfectly pure and ego-free. he hates herself for having bad thoughts, and thinks that everyone else hates her too. And in turn she hates herself for hating herself, often dragging herself into a loop that can end up with a panic attack or something similar.  I have a friend who has serious problems with being a human, because humans aren't perfectly pure and selfless, which in turn isolates her from everyone. I'd like to help her somehow, but I don't know what kind of condition could cause someone to behave like an unwanted saint who hurts people (emotionally) more than not. imply listening so far have only lead to me feeling guilty and miserable both for her and myself.*My friend may have aspergers",1635164021,5408,906

Because we have trouble understanding people’s perspective if we've never had the specific experience ourselves. even with the sympathy part, it's mostly that we can feel sorry for someone, we just can't understand or comprehend why they feel the way they feel. stereotype is so harmful. It portrays us as not caring about others at all. If you interact with someone who's autistic for some time, you'd understand that we do have empathy.This stereotype is so harmful",1635134260,1004,166

aspergers,"How to explain to neurotypical person to understand some phrases or words they should not use around me? am almost 3 years now since I was diagnosed with aspergers( but here we’re I live they use autism as a broad term) first I kept this very private and only shared with a few people that I trusted. of family there was a friend and she was the first person I told.  may I mentioned to her how a certain fictional character from an anime had over 30 autistic traits. I then explained some research I had found showing how often mental illnesses/dissabilities and neurodivergent traits are used in media and passed off as personality quirks. Which really hurts all of us because it dilutes the traits with personality so the rest of the public does not distinguish between one and the other. will explain more of that below after I finish telling my story. also told her that this doesn’t mean she now has to like the character. response:Even thou that character has all those traits that belong to authistic people I do not recognize him as autistic. I don’t have problem with autistic people I have autistic friends. upset me. Not because she disagreed with the research but because of the way she phrased it. right does she have to decide what is an isn’t autistic? Even if it’s a fictional character. really caught me off guard. And I only wrote back. “I’m upset” she asked why.I tried making a comparison. she responded with the same literall thing she had just responded with. that point I cut off communication. she thinks I am in the wrong and that I was forcing her to accept the research.  I wanted was for her to watch her language. spoke to a mutual friend and they completely ignored that part and just wrongly focused on making it about me forcing her to accept the research. was already affected by the situation so I sent her(the mutual friend) the link and told them that this will explain what I mean a lot better than my own words. promised to read it and later on lied to me telling me that we were done with that topic. I didn’t bother arguing with them about that because I despise it when people break their promises and lie. of this happened and it caused the worst mental breakdown I have ever had I spent over 3 month depressed and being highly emotional. Only other close friends and family were there for me and they expressed concern thinking I would self harm. Every day I would just cry any time. I was sleeping about 15 hours a day. mutual friend told me that she knows exactly what she did wrong and that she hasn’t apologized because of pride.                  The research research and articles I found explained how in many cases authors are unaware of the fact that traits they are using are associated with mental conditions. example is maybe the author interacted with someone who is autistic and they did not know, and so they made a character with all of those traits and said the character was an introvert or an arrogant person. could have also based the character on another character that was based on another character until eventually arriving at the author that based the character on a real person who was authistic, bipolar etc. affects everyone because it is mixing everything up and creating misconceptions.How to explain to neurotypical person to understand some phrases or words they should not use around me?",1635107348,3363,598

They were stimming via frequent shoulder rubbing as they walked up to any and every stranger wanting to share facts about pandas and bamboo.  sat back for a moment observing. Mainly because I like to stand back from the exhibit glass, next to the stroller, and allow other folks to get close and take a look. I don't like being the family with all their gear blocking the view for everyone else. Anyway, I sat back and watched this kid excitedly try to talk to folks and share. Most shied away, some looked at the mom, others just ignored. I'll preface, I hold no judgement. ome people are unsure of themselves, or how the parents will act, and choose just not to engage. I on the other hand, feeling that I may have correctly identified a fellow human with AD, decided to walk up and ask what other facts they knew. I am admittedly a little jealous at the joy this kid appeared to be feeling that someone asked them to share facts. If only this was a technology convention and someone asked me what I thought. haha.  o, I stood there while my family watched the pandas learning more things about pandas and bamboo than I'd ever taken the time to research on my own.

For context, we are all 16-18 years old. just don't understand how they don't seem to be able to follow the simplest social rules, even though they are all neurotypical. I'm a special needs student (the only one in my class), yet I was the only one that knew, or at least followed rules like paying attention when our guide was talking, taking my hat off when entering churches, standing in line (more like trying to, because no one else bothered) when our teachers were doing a headcount and getting up and going to breakfast on time. I attend one of the better schools in my country, so this confuses me even more.  one of the few people in my school who actually follows the dress code, is respectful to the teachers and follows those unwritten social rules that some very nice people have written down in neat little guidebooks, that in my opinion everyone should read and internalise.  know how to tie a tie, what cutlery to use when and for what, what and how many flowers are appropriate in a situation, when to keep quiet and when to speak up, and much more. I know what to wear when and where, who to greet first, how to eat politely, how to talk to men and women alike and how to behave myself.  peers know none of this, at least they don't seem to know. I feel like gen z and millenials are the rudest, dumbest, worst behaved people on planet earth, because they don't follow those rules. irks me is that autistic people are thought of as socially inept, but I clearly am not, and this is not just a delusion of mine. My teachers notice this and often compliment me on that. am I better at being a polite person than post neurotypical people my age, when the stereotype would suggest otherwise? worst thing is I actually had a nightmare where the people I was in the hotel room with called me a ""Karen"" and complained how they had to ""deal with my behaviour for three days"" and how I should ""feel lucky that someone even wanted to stay with me"".

That would take far too much mental effort, if you had to re-design the race track, second by second, as you are racing along it. other words, this activity of identifying that the race track is correct, this should have already been done, before you started racing through the track. you understand what I am saying here? autistic person is like a person who starts racing around a track, but then gets off to a bad start, believes that something is ""unfair about the rules"", ""unfair about the race track design"", and then demands a re-start of the race. They demand that the race be restarted.  you take this mentality far enough, you will never start the race in the first place, because there is literally no limitation on how deep you can go into ""checking"" behaviour.  could say that the first 1 second of the race was unfair.  could say the first 0.1 seconds were unfair.  could say the first 0.01 seconds were unfair could say the first 0.001 seconds were unfair is no limitation. way it works is, you construct the race, you say that this is good enough, and then you race through the damn track. human working memory can only hold 7 things at once. This is just about enough memory, to basically steer this vehicle without crashing. Once you start this race, you are either racing, or you are not. There is no time for clever tricks in the middle. is precisely what autism is, and precisely how autism works. be productive with autism, you are constructing a race track, purely for yourself, purely based on your own rules, and you are racing through it. has to comply with the rules of society, such as, follow the law, regulations, you need to have enough money to pay to rent out the racing facility for the day, to buy the barriers, etc, to rent out the go-karts. once the race track is built, it's built! There are infinite different ways that you could tweak this race car track. Infinite. You will NEVER finish constructing this race track, if you keep changing subtle little things. You have to just build it, finish it, and then race through it. suspect that autistic working memory actually contains significantly less than the 7 things most can hold. Our short-term memory is often highly impaired. We are very poor at adjusting to new situations, to new ""race car tracks"", to anything that is different or out of place. autistic activity that succeeds, is basically, that you set out 30 minutes for a race car track, and you race through it. I'm not even so sure that you can race against other cars on the track., because you are going to out of sync with them, crash into them, what if they don't follow the rules of the road themselves? It's too much. This is going to be more like a race car track that you rent out all for yourself that day, and you race through it, all by yourself, all alone. people could be at this race car track. You could have some friends standing on the side and cheering you on. But they are to stand behind a clearly-defined line, and not to cross the line. If they cross the line, you stop racing the car, and you abandon the thing, and start again. autistic person, quite simply, is inversing ""designer"" with ""worker"". world that we live in, works on continual, ongoing dopamine release, which for many people, is tied to their jobs, but also their wives, families, even video games, etc. ""work"" is dopamine, and dopamine is ongoing needed. It is repetitive.  is really little if any actual difference, of one race car track to another, of one golf course to another, of one smartphone to another. is a highly, highly limited role in this world, for the ""designer"". there are massive numbers of jobs for the ""worker"". you need to design this race car track, as decently as you can, but to really cut this whole activity short, and get started doing the actual ""work"" of racing through this track again and again. the best way to find out if anything is wrong with your race track, is to race through it for real. No one designs something correctly the first time, without glitches. No one writes computer code correctly the first time, without glitches.  autistic unemployed unproductive person, is simply stuck in perpetual ""designer"" mode. They imagine on and on and on in more and more and more detail and perfectionism, and they never actually DO the thing. The autistic person is stuck in ""chizoid"" mode, designing an ever-increasingly-complex race car track, on and on and on, and never actually racing through it.There is no such thing as a productive sentence",1635057928,5706,1015

aspergers,"As I mentioned in my introductory post, I have had a crush on the same woman for 27 years.  I neglected to add that she wasn't the only one I ever had a crush on.   I've fallen for many different girls.  I have stopped revealing my feeling for them when high school started. reason being that, it was around middle school that I became ""self-aware"".  I wasn't like the other kids.  They weren't laughing *with* me, they were laughing *at* me.  When I told a girl that I had a crush on them, they recoiled.  I was *not* someone who had the good looks, charisma, or (as far as they know( the intelligence to be considered date material.  I wasn't their last option for a boyfriend.  I wasn't an option at all. in mind, I never needed to be in special ed.  I had normal classes and actually kept my grades at an average level, mostly (cience sucked).  But I had a speech impediment (got it mostly fixed when I had my cleft repair surgery in the summer of '96, but I still didn't sound completely normal.).  I *was* friends with some of the kids in special ed, and I was shy (didn't know I had Aspergers at this time) clearly I was mentally handicapped, and therefore undateable. began to hate myself in high school, and became too afraid of the look I'd get from any girl I'd ask out.  That recoil.  That nervous few seconds it takes them to come up with an excuse.  One girl actually became afraid of me.  I became Quasimodo.  Watching from afar, memorizing their features, learning their names, getting to know them through overheard conversations and gossip.  I didn't want it to be this way, of course.  But I did get used to it.  I was the creepy outsider that everyone was told not to stare at, to ignore. has become my MO in life.  If it weren't for social media like Facebook I probably wouldn't have any kind of social life. (I know, I know.  ""Facebook bad."")

This was long after everyone else stopped noticing me.  he and my mom talked to each other since she lived nearby and her friend lived right across the street from us.  he has this fun sense of humor, and let me tell you... her ***eyes*** might be one of her best physical features.  I can get into what started my attraction to her, but it's kinda embarrassing, if I'm being totally honest.  Let's just say, one day she became more than a face in the crowd. am not obsessed. I don't think about her consistently, I have many other things on my mind (Getting my own house being top among them).  But during the times I'm not doing anything, or even whenever she posts something new on FB, these feelings well up.  Like now.

aspergers,"This is something I've struggled with for a long time.  I'm in my mid 30s so I really should be past this at this point in my life, but I don't know where to learn this.  I came from an abusive background, so I have a hard time telling if someone is just messing around, or actually doesn't like me, and wants me to leave.  I went out and joined a men's sports league and feel very out of place and want to quit because I feel like I am not wanted there, but don't know if my feelings are valid or not, or if they're just messing around.  am well aware that I'm very different from most people and seriously struggle with social situations of any kind to the point I've basically become a hermit and haven't interacted with anyone outside of my immediate family in a non-work setting in years, even online.   can't 'small talk' at all with coworkers or acquaintances, and a lot of people take this to mean I'm slow, which I guess gives some people confidence to say things to me they wouldn't say to others. normally don't react one way or another if someone is rude and pretend I didn't hear it or try to laugh it off, which makes me kind of bottle it all up and explode at once if the same person keeps doing it.  If I continue to ignore it, some people tend to ramp it up to get a reaction out of me, usually in front of an audience.   had people in the past say to me to not sit and take it, but if I say anything back or react in anger, people get so angry at me and never at the person who started the conflict, which makes me want to withdraw even more and just avoid any social situations altogether.    just don't know how to defuse the situation without just laying down and doing nothing, or how to 'fight back' without getting everyone pissed off at me or laughing at me.

aspergers,"I'm writing this just as much for me as any of you.  As an aspie it's easy to stay stuck in the cycle of introspection and completely neglect showing appreciation for your spouse. id like to take a moment to share some appreciation of her. started dating nearly 4 years ago, and I immediately absorbed her Into my life. This was a girl who had her life put together with no ones help but her own. was working a badass job making more money than me(but made sure to NEVER rub that in my face, and was very careful not to emasculate me by talking about it in front of my friends), she had a group of good friends, and was never bored. Her fervor and excitement for life shined like a diamond in a coal mine. Every day, no matter how bad work was or what was going on, she had a smile on her face and was ready to go.  if she needed to work early she would stay out late with me, and do it with a smile on her face. Even when I would drag her to boring gatherings, she never complained and always tried to make the best of the situation. paid attention to me. he learned what I like and don't like, she made thoughtful gifts that actually meant something to me, and would leave little notes around for me to find that would always brighten my day. We both made each other happy, but I definitely let things get one sided.  example one Christmas I bought her fog lights for her car. It was an older car and new parts were hard to find and the ones I ordered arrived in pretty terrible shape. Meanwhile, she was individually wrapping hundreds of cookies and filling them into a backpack for me. You might ask why someone would want hundreds of cookie? I would always bring home a cookie from lunch in my backpack and share it with her when we got together after work. he remembered that and noticed what I like, and turned that into an incredible gift ill never forget.  in my selfishness I took from her and didn't give back how a loving partner should. I wouldn't go to events with her friends, to the point where they stopped inviting her. I asked her every day to come join me in my life (which was a pretty boring one in retrospect, but she was happy to do so because it meant she would be with me), and in the process took her hobbies and routine away from her so I could selfishly have the life I thought I wanted and have her by my side.  I was trying to buy a house, she offered to empty her savings for the down-payment and sign a contract saying if we broke up I wouldn't owe her anything. We weren't even engaged at that point, and she was willing to do ANYTHING for me.  my family and friends would be shitty to me(most of the time I didn't even notice, damn you AD), she would stand up for me and call them out. And when they would be shitty to her, I would sit silently and wait for the situation to pass. Or even worse, defend them and argue with her that they weren't being mean.  of my aspie obsessions is miatas. I drive one and its an incredible machine. he came to every autocross with me and stood in a hot parking lot for 8-10 hours to support me and cheer me on. And when we would get done at the race, she would ask if we could go to the fair in the same parking lot, or out on a date. And id either have a headache that I wasn't willing to deal with to spend time with her,  or I'd want to go to the same bar with my friends that we went to weekly.  he grew to appreciate the miata as much as I did, and it became her dream car. After she beat cancer essentially on her own, she bought it. With her money. With her job, that she did even while sitting in the chemo chair. And she's completely embraced that love of miatas that I have as well. helped me move up in my career. he showed me love and affection every day. he built up my self confidence and self worth and truly made me the happiest I've ever been. And I repaid her by doing the bare minimum or putting in half assed efforts and just expecting her to keep on giving. guess what I'm getting at in all of this is that it's one thing to appreciate what your partner does for you. Its a completely different thing to take that same level of energy and put it behind actions to do the same for them.  their accomplishments with the world, celebrate their victories with them, plan them a birthday party(because you know they will/did for you), make sure you tell those around you about how great they are to you. Make them your special interest and put every bit of effort you have into them, because if they are half as good as my wife has been to me, then that's what they've been doing for you.

I am wondering if some of this could be over stimulating, but she’s done it so long I’m not sure how to propose that.

He also said that I should leave him as he has ""my bad traits and nobody can fix him"".  has since written him off. Likewise. Enjoy your tin hat, father of the year. He doesn't need to be fixed, he needs to be understood. You gave up on a pretty awesome son. I'm happy to be his love, his support and his chill zone so he doesn't have to worry about being out of place or ""not normal"" with you. Bummer. He is extraordinary with me and I knew that from the start :) mom's reaction was to pull him out of school as he was the ""weird kid that made noises with his mouth while all the kids colored"". He was homeschooled by a neighbor until high-school.  he also advised me to ""don't let him watch rain man when you buy your house. He's going to know he acts the same and get upset.

My brother didn’t and I’ve told him how that made me feel and he still didn’t care. I have minimal friends, no close friends and I just don’t know what I’m doing wrong? I don’t feel like a negative person, so maybe it’s because people don’t like how straight talking I am, how honest I am or maybe they just look down on me. I don’t even know but it’s so frustrating because you see families and they seem all happy and they go to each other’s houses at Christmas and have the best time but my family isn’t like that  at all, everyone’s just turned so selfish and the only thing they care about is looking good on Facebook. I won’t stand for injustice and I won’t be walked all over so yes I have stood up for myself before, with my dad putting the blame on his failed relationship all on my mum when in actual fact he’s the one in the wrong and now he’s got another family and they don’t like me because of the lies he’s spouted about my mum, it’s Fucking ridiculous, the guys a racist, narcissistic bigot, and I’m meant to accept him because he’s my biological father?

aspergers,"ome examples The subtitle of the season (which I didn't even know non-anthology-or-spinoff fandoms could do for seasons) of Doctor Who coming up, Flux, says it all as I feel like the whole show is currently in a state of flux with dealing with the aftermath (and whether or not to sweep it under the rug when they get a new Doctor and showrunner after this season and if they do, how to do so without looking obvious) of the big revelations of the previous season finale and with the new Doctor (who I don't know gender of (as they've already been cast-and-kept-secret as the current one's filmed her regeneration scene) but if they're a guy I'm afraid we'll never get a female Doctor again) and showrunner coming. And also with something I heard on io9.com saying Tennant would be open to coming back my heart kinda sank into my toes as I aspie-catastrophized a fear that they're just going to reboot nuWho just because of the reaction to the season that just finished even though it's got some amazing things in it I'd hate to see erased (like that whole not-necessarily-love-triangle-but-at-least-interesting-relationship-dynamic-triangle between the 12th Doctor, Clara Oswald and the Michelle Gomez incarnation of The Master, or an episode from the 13th Doctor's first season that was actually among my favorite nuWho episodes (or at least favorite ones that aren't iconic like Blink or Dalek that ""everyone likes""), ""It Takes You Away"" (the one with the lonely universe-frog who could shapeshift and one of 13's male companions trying to process his grief for a lost love)). And not to mention the fact that (if they aren't completely resetting everything like that) there's still the matter of it seeming like Gallifrey is gone for good (along with all the storytelling potential its return brought) and they're doing some ""Last Of The Time Lords"" bullshit once again unless they pull out another deus ex machina o they just announced the new name for the cowboy hero in Overwatch I previously posted about my anxiety about getting renamed and I'm not even going to say either name as (at least for this initial period of time post-change) I'm afraid though people have said some fans would still call him the old name people will accuse people who use it of either condoning or themselves being guilty of the things the hero's namesake was accused of doing that led to the rename but people on the other side would accuse people who use the new name of being victims of cancel culture (and I've only heard him referred to as the new name as both first and last name so I'm not sure which would be his in-game ""hero name"" as they haven't said and the only place I've seen evidence one might be is people changing the ship portmanteaus). Name anxiety (and just general aspie fear of change amplified by my emotional connection to this lore/universe) aside A. as they haven't given a lore reason yet (and I thought that was one of the reasons this process was taking so damn long, to find a lore reason that makes sense) and the closest I've seen on the Overwatch sub seemed both unofficial and like a ""It's not a phase, Mom"" meme rejiggered and B. since I don't know if the fandom's supposed to memory-hole all references to the old name/act as if it's always been the new name or not I'm more confused than when they first brought up the possibility of the name change (and it doesn't help that some people on the Overwatch sub have been jokingly being kinda dystopian, like saying references to the old name in old articles are ""typographical errors in [new name] articles"") Not only is being a Harry Potter fan feeling harder and harder but I'm now afraid the same criticisms might extend to the Percy Jackson fandom too. Why Harry Potter fandom is feeling harder isn't just the obvious (and the fact that I don't know what JK actually said anymore and that people say that people who believe what they claim she believes are now using that they like Harry Potter as a code signal for those beliefs and I don't know if it's true or if it's like the apparently-false-until-people-made-it-true thing that happened with the OK hand sign especially in emoji form) but it's because due to that kind of criticism I don't know what she actually wrote in the books that's actually problematic and what's on par with believing because she said (and later tweeted) that Dumbledore was gay (something she couldn't have put in the books in the late 90s given Dumbledore's job without people thinking he was a pedophile) in response to a fan question about if he ever had a wife that ""she goes around randomly making characters gay for woke points and if you complain she just might make you gay too via tweet"". How Percy Jackson (or rather everything in that universe that Rick Riordan himself wrote) figures into this aside from those books also being popular fiction for the same age group Rick Riordan's been starting to get accused of problematic stuff now too and just because he apologized for some of the first things doesn't mean people are letting up and of these accusations (like writing Piper in an insensitive way for a Native character and making her Cherokee supposedly being stereotypical as well as supposedly tying Egyptian gods to Western civilization in The Kane Chronicles (when I thought it was only the Greco-Roman pantheons that ""moved with the heart of the west"") and apparently Doing A Problematic for not having all the human main characters at least partially be (and human forms for non-human characters look that way) ethnically Egyptian) I don't know which are true and of the true ones I don't know which he's apologized for or not (as even an apology wouldn't be enough for some unless he changed canon in a way that made sense to fix it) I've been a fan of all seasons of Leverage and the one season we have so far of Leverage: Redemption. However, one thing about Leverage: Redemption worries me that otherwise wouldn't and it has nothing to do with if it ever brings up Covid-19 or how it reconciles the existence of the Librarian movies in-universe (poster for the first movie seen on a bus stop in one episode of the original Leverage, second movie is the in-flight movie on a plane in another) with the fact that with Noah Wyle's addition to the cast there now are two actors from the franchise (Christian Kane was on the sequel series The Librarians) in the Leverage: Redemption cast (or for that matter how what that combined with any mentions of Covid would mean about if the Leverage and/or Librarian franchises exist in our universe/are cover-ups for real events). My problem is that when the second half of the first season of Leverage: Redemption dropped, r/television called it the second half of its ""revival season"" therefore implying Leverage: Redemption either got cancelled (shows especially with that kind of popularity don't just get news of cancellation halfway through unless they do something super-radical) or was only meant to last one season. ince I highly doubt either and the similarly-Chaotic-Good show Rebel (same vibe in not just Chaotic Good but found-family-is-kind-of-actual-family as heroine had three different kids by three different men) got cancelled around the same time part of me wants to think there's some kind of conspiracy afoot that a found-family of real heroes like that has to stop by ""steal""ing a TV studio but part of me hears some of the accusations of problematicness Leverage: Redemption itself has gotten of queerbaiting and ACAB-baiting and fears that isn't the case either but what if that's just part of the conspiracy As I've said on other posts Homestuck has been kind of weird for me for two reasons. The first is the epilogues/Homestuck^2. ome of the creative decisions made for directions to take certain characters feel weird and OOC to me so I keep clinging to fan theories about them not being canon (but not in the ""there is no thing I hate in Ba ing e"" way in the sense of e.g. a third Pumpkin timeline instead of just meat and candy and Homestuck^2 being called Homestuck^2 as if to say it isn't officially Homestuck 2). However, then I run into a problem I have every time I come across any sort of problematic-but-not-in-the-bigoted-explicitly-way writing decision in a piece of fiction like this. I want to hate it but then someone posts some cool thinkpiece about how actually it has some amazing meta-meaning or plot significance because [x], [y] and [z] and was foreshadowed expertly by plot details [a], [b] and [c] and now I feel like ""it has larger meaning, I can't hate it/want it gone because that means the whole narrative would crumble down like a Jenga tower"". The other reason is that one viral arah Z video making it sound like (idr, it's been so long since I even heard of this discourse, and also idr the reasons) either Homestuck was problematic in and of itself or Hussie was therefore making Homestuck problematic by proxy and for the same reason people think Harry Potter is because of JK Rowling. I don't remember what he did to cause this controversy but I do know it got so bad when it was a thing (and isn't now for whatever reason) that people were making memes about Homestuck actually having been created by Hatsune Miku and Toby Fox. help?

aspergers,"tl;dr: Was with partner. Told them I'm on spectrum, which prompted a shift in behavior I suspect could be unmasking, which was characterized by avoidance of eye contact, increased intensity of stimming, and reduction of verbal fluency. was hanging out with my partner when I decided to inform them that I believe I am on the spectrum. Before this point, I was talkative (It could even be said that I was dominating the conversation somewhat), had no issue maintaining eye contact, and felt completely at ease as if I were alone. Moments before the reveal, I became anxious evident by a somewhat severe leg shake. When it came the moment to speak, I found myself unable to to utter what I had in mind. It took considerable effort to blurt the words ""I think I am on the spectrum."" out. For about the 20 minutes that ensued, I found myself completely avoiding eye contact, stimming intensely with my fingers/hands (way more than my usual amount), and finding difficulties articulating the thoughts in mind and generally being less fluent compared than earlier. was not afraid or anxious of being judged by my partner and expected their response to be generally positive, and it was. imilar experiences had happened numerous times prior, but I always attributed them to an anxiety attack or a hefty drop in mood. This was the first occurrence of such experience after I started believing I was on the spectrum which allowed me to make the connection.   this a case of unmasking?

aspergers,"Hello, I am an adult with autism(asperger) in a relationship and I have a question when it comes to discussions.The person I’m seeing and I are often getting into arguments when things happen where feelings overwhelm both of us so much, that all we talk about is the logical points and facts and do not combine the emotional effects of it.I‘m not sure if this is related to my past traumas I‘ve had since early childhood or if I am asking for reasonable things. when we talk about stuff I refrain to saying „this is not fair“ or „this is how that situation made me feel“ and it is always brushed off by saying that the intent was not to make me feel that way or that it was fair for them. Our arguments always turn into 2-6 hour talks about rhetorics and semantics. they called me and told me they talked about my past traumas with a friend (which I previously said I wouldn‘t mind). Then they told me that the person and they thought it was surreal and there were only three things. Before going further they said that they still like me, they just want to clear things up because they‘re emotionally involved. The three points are I either had an insanely shitty life so far, I am delusional and crazy or I am sane and make this up for pity. I felt sad and told about facts, they asked me for evidence and I named all I could including a name to which they responded „can you repeat that name, I want to write that down and see if I can get that checked“.  I told them that I am hurt, I don‘t blame them but I felt the way I was asked about this was already not trusting me. I don‘t have a reason to lie about abuse since I was born. I feel like my emotions are still valid. it ok to feel that way or is it normal or is my autism, ptsd, adhd or my past traumas creating those feelings and I need to get help?

aspergers,"I'm still fairly new to online multiplayer games. I'm middle aged but never had the bandwidth to play online games until recently. I'm not sure what is proper etiquette, if such a thing exists. I also have social anxiety disorder in addition to Asperger's.  had this experience recently where I was playing a team based sports  game. It was me vs 3 inexperienced players. I was winning by two points.  Another good player joined my team and just stood there, doing nothing,  allowing the other team to score once or twice. Then they started  playing. At this point I was already annoyed, just stood there  observing, and considered quitting. That's when I saw my teammate  deliberately score two own goals (they scored for the other team).   asked them about it and someone from the other team said my teammate  was trolling me. But by the time that was said, I had already cursed at  my teammate, ""thanked"" them for ruining the game and I quit. I went to  practice on another server and the teammate came in, asked me why I  thought I had the right to curse at them. I was already mad, so I told  them to ""f\*\*k off."" Of course, I said the whole thing, I didn't bleep it  out.  later apologized  to that teammate, but I don't know what will happen. But, he acts like  this is all my fault. If he had deliberately scored own goals during a  match with a full server of players, they would've been steaming mad at him. If  one of the server owners had seen that, they might've banned him. played with this guy before and he's always been nice and has never done anything like that. o I don't know why he did this. I'm certain it was deliberate and not an accident, but I'm not 100% certain. guess it was wrong for me to call him an a-hole and tell him to f\*\*k off.

I started thinking about all the interactions I had with her, and how she went out of her way to talk to me a few times. I also realised that all of her boyfriends were geeky. o I decided to follow her, and I saw later that she followed me back. Yesterday I worked up the courage to start texting her. We started texting each other. There were long pauses between texts, and I was really nervous that she didnt really want to talk, despite her sending long texts instead of short ones.  Then I realised how enthusiastic her texts seemed, and the conversation shifted to psychology. he sent me long texts about what she found interesting about psychology and I told her what I found interesting. I then asked if she'd like to hang out and she actually said yes! he said that shes going to be busy for the next week and a bit but she said she'd really like to hang out. Honestly, even if she isnt interested in dating I'm still ecstatic. he's smart and kind and fun and absolutely gorgeous!

Neurodivergent as mentally over-sensitive or under-sensitive.  They don't **vibe** the same way. tried to think through a conclusion for this, but I think the function is to remember that the ""spectrum"" goes both ways, with neurotypical in the middle. This isn't to say neurotypical is ""flat,"" more that neurodivergence has a different frequency and amplitude altogether. I just made this graphic to think about it further- each person's functioning is visualized as a sine wave: [Imgur Link To Neurodivergence Frequency Graphic]( minds struggle with being both ""too much"" and ""not enough"" relative to those around them. With good reason, they don't hold or express neurotypical forms synchronously. Occasionally, or through experience-based adaptation, they can match neurotypicals directly, but will be flying off in some other direction the next moment if left to themselves. is also worth noting that very few people remain at a perfect ""neurotypical"" frequency and amplitude at all times- in fact, it doesn't exist- it's just an average that morphs through time and place. The following is not to downplay struggles- it is to think about situating them into a larger view and considering what can, or even needs, to be within an individual's control. things can be seen as a dualistic cycle- day and night, waking and sleeping, birthing and dying. The human body is made of innumerable parts, but generally seen as a single unit- a distant city can be covered by one's own hand.  In nature, there is harmony and dissonance.

aspergers,"Hey guys, a 35y AFAB autistic with ADHD and a slew of the other fun common conditions of neurodiversity.  the last decade, I’ve very much limited my social interactions. I learnt in my early twenties what level of sociability I was comfortable with, and thus led a life filled with plenty of acquaintances but few true friends.  was fine with this, however recently schedule changes at work led to me working many of my shifts (I’m a nurse working in a small residential behavioural support facility) with a girl who, surprisingly, I get along well with (historically friendships with females have proven difficult for me in terms of relating to other AFAB folk).  girl is definitely ND, wth ADHD as a shoe-in. he’s still exploring her neurodiversity. However, we have much in common, and despite us being in the opposite ends of the introversion/extroversion scale, she has proven to be somewhat of a ‘social conduit’ at work for me, paving the way for me to get to know coworkers better through instigating group conversation, etc. We have also caught up outside of work a couple of times, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. he doesn’t drain my social meter much, which I am very grateful for.  the point - I’m stressed this is all going to fall apart.  feel I’m messing this up from the get go, by being too ‘in my head’ about making sure I do/say all the ‘right things’. I can’t let go of the knowledge that I’ve been in this situation before a number of times - lead to social burnout, isolating myself from the world, and ultimately watching connections fade away.  know so much more about myself these days, and so I hope that I can improve on my social abilities, but I just cannot shake that thought in my mind that this is all for nothing.  else for a bit of self sabotage on a Friday morning?Anxiety over newly found sociability",1634894074,1833,326

aspergers,"o i recently had a few meetings regarding a diagnosis with aspergers, I honestly thought that I am on the spectrum...After giving her 3 ""quizzes""(?) regarding symptoms, one answered by me, the other two from my mum and dad, she told me that theres a big difference between what I answered and what my parents answered. he also told me that my teachers from elementary school did not write down anything that could be a symptom of asperger.  she told she thinks I am a kind of too introverted person with a few compulsions and social anxiety. whole situation makes me angry, I grew up with an autistic brother, so far on the spectrum he still cant talk as an 18 year old, I had to take care of him since I was young and my parents neglected me and treated me like shit because of the stress they had...I wrote a huge document to my  psychiatrist  where I had examples of every question that I answered with yes. These were things I actively remember doing next to or with my parents when I was younger, and yet none of them noted any of these examples aswell. drives me crazy aswell is that she told me that it wouldnt make sense to diagnose me with aspergers because I am not struggling with it anyways, thus it does not restrict me.

aspergers,"OK, guys. I have autism. This is my theory on why we can't socialise... are identifying each other, using eye movements, using facial movements. are not precise numbers, but, let's say most people do 100 facial movements. then, let's say, autistic people only do 10 facial movements. it's like Face ID on Apple, and notice how Apple has added in more of these ""dots"" onto their Face ID, to make it more and more accurate. is actually a mental condition, I forget the name, where people think their own wife has been replaced with a fake wife. believe their own mother has been replaced with a fake mother. does a human being actually identify another human being anyway? You can fake that with perfume? You can fake that with a disguise, just ask the CIA. patterns? Much harder, if not impossible, to fake. I watched a BBC documentary years ago, on how CCTV cameras identify people with walking patterns. Ah! Now, you ""could"" identify someone, by quizzing them on their entire life story, every time you meet them. But that would take hours upon hours upon hours. This may even be why Aspergers talk at length on and on, this is our form of identifying each other. clearly, we only have 24 hours in a day, so we cannot possibly expect to socialise if we are talking at such length! the early months of our life as a baby, we failed to make proper facial and eye contact with our own mothers. This is the basis of a new treatment for autism that has been developed. They re-train mothers to make proper eye contact and then autism is apparently prevented. This was in the news recently. about new room concept? Autistic people, if one small thing changes in the room, believe that it's an entirely new room. Apparently this is why we get so startled by new situations. This is why we are overwhelmed at an airport with 100s of people walking around. This is why we are overwhelmed driving a car or a bike, with 100s of cars on the road, and all the different sounds etc. have a really strange feeling here, that we cannot socialise, because we are not even convinced that it's the same person in the room. autistic brain has actually been said to almost ""blank out"" other people in the room altogether. ubconsciously, it's like we almost don't believe there ARE any people in the room. Or that we are ""shape shifting"" throughout ""parallel universes"", and different humans are entering the room every split second.  as if we cannot talk to these humans, because we think that every second, it's actually a different human in the room altogether. It would be pointless starting a conversation with a person, if they are a new person every second? yeah, fun extra. I actually have anosmia, as one of my ""sensory issues"". I literally have no sense of smell whatsoever. o I can't use smell whatsoever to identify people. it really an identification issue? if so, what would the solution be? people are said to be like 24/7 ""workers"". We see others as ""colleagues"" rather than ""friends"" talk to people for ""specific purposes"", like ""do this particular thing"", rather than, ""let's just hang out"" suck at ""small talk"", and again, would take to you only for a pre-approved, ""white listed"" task. the solution for autism, is that we must basically pre-arrange each activity with a person, and then carry it out. also seem to entirely suck at ""interactive"", ""two-way"" conversation. We need ""one-way"" everything. are really just no different from a video tape, that plays from start to finish, and that's why we HATE being interrupted. feel like our conversation in autism, is more like, we rant at you for 30 minutes solid, you record it with an audio recorder, you go away and analyse what I've just said to you, and then you come back, with a 30 minute rant at me. And we go back and forth. almost like chess players, playing this long-term chess game, where they might come back, once a week, to make a new move on the board. ongoing, day-to-day, two-way conversation, it just doesn't work, and leads to shouting and argument with us. are ridiculously slow to interpret new situations. This is why in jobs, we are best doing pre-arranged jobs which we can entirely ""pre-rehearse"", such as, learning the items on a menu, before applying to the restaurant. as, being an actor in a play, and learning our lines, before showing up on stage. I also feel like, when we do get interrupted, that we should immediately ""throw in the towel"", and start the task all over again. way that we socialise, I believe, is entirely one-directional. This is not my theory. I have read this from proper sources. Autism is similar to ADHD, even narcissistic disorder, in this regard, in these long-winded, one-directional conversations. really do feel that, we should have one single rule for conversation, which is that, we have pre-defined, in minutes, how long I am going to talk to you. And then, if you interrupt me at all, that I will simply ""eject altogether"", and abandon the entire conversation. example, if you were in a school classroom, and one kid is calling you names, and you can hear it behind your back, with your exceptional autistic hearing, in your ears. and then, let's say, this kid at school, and he spreads rumours to the other kids, that you are a loser, and now you have 2, 3, 4, 5 kids all making fun of you, behind your back. so what is the solution here? The solution, is to leave the school classroom altogether, and not come back, until everyone stops making fun of you. You cannot do the autistic rage thing where you get angrier and angrier, and then start attacking the kids.  solution to any and all school bullying, by the way, is to do what I just said. To literally leave the entire classroom. if you were browsing through your files in Windows File Explorer. And you were going into a folder, and there are like 100s of files and sub-folders, and it's all so complex. And you just said, screw it, let's go back up. o you press the ""up"" arrow in your file explorer, and you ""escape"" the entire folder directory altogether. so that is what we are supposed to do, with autism and socialising. entered this folder, to find one specific file, and if we go 5 minutes and can't find it, and now we're forgetting why we even entered this folder at all, OK, so now we just abort the entire thing. Press ""up"", go back up to the directory ""root"" above this folder, stop what you are doing, re-collect your thoughts, and when you are ready, go back in again. you ever programmed computers? you make just ONE error in the computer code, the entire code aborts. will spend the next, God damn, I don't know, 15 minutes, just looking for some semicolon that you put in the wrong place, or bracket or something. is autism. If we find one thing that surprises us, we really, in my opinion, have little to no ""thinking skills on the spot"", to figure out, ""on the spot"", how to correct this error. are, in my view, like computer code, where if there is one error, it just won't compile at all. are like people, if we are running a running race, and we must always come in first place. And if we are getting behind, and it looks like we have lost the race, that we just throw a tantrum, and want to restart the race all over again. is absolutely no point whatsoever, in telling yourself, that this is a ""bad thing"" and we should ""change our behaviour to become more like neurotypicals"". no. This way of thinking is so deeply embedded in us.  have seen autistic people married to each other in a relationship, long-term, and it is just miserable, long-term fighting, bickering, arguing, every day. The two people tug on each other, and they prevent each other doing anything without the other person's permission. They take every single attempt at breaching out into the world, and tug it down, parasitically stick to it, cling to it, hold it down, slow you down. It makes it impossible to be productive. doesn't so much resemble a relationship, as more like a battle in an arena. It's like the couple have gone off into their own chizoid world, where in chizoid Personality Disorder, it's just you, your very best friend/wife, and then the rest of the world is ""blockaded out"".  is basically very dangerous, like domestic abuse, and once the relationship inevitably fails and you finally leave, it's like, you've gone decades now with no money or work skills etc. simply, the solution to autistic socialising, is to compartmentalise everything you do. Everything is just its own little thing.  interaction with your wife should be like a 30-minute pre-approved video tape that plays back. You pre-schedule it, you show up on time, a bit like a psychiatry webcam appointment or something. just don't do this sporadic, unplanned, co-operative behaviour at all. We need to be told what to do, or tell someone else what to do. But we are remarkably bad at this ""interactive"" social behaviour.Could Aspergers socialising problems be an identification issue?",1634882962,8938,1582

I didn't get my diagnosis until my parents realized that I had Pica and sent me to a psych ward when I was in third grade. My younger brother is also on the spectrum, and he was diagnosed before he was 2 years old. As soon as my parents found out I too was on the spectrum, I started to see a constant flow of psychiatrists. I learned how to mask, and I learned how to do it *really* well. I had already been pretty good at masking before my diagnosis, which is why I believe it took me so much longer than my brother to get diagnosed. I studied facial expressions, body language, and tone of voice. I studied how NT people behaved and talked to one another. I frequently people-watched and started to mold and sculpt myself like a piece of clay. However, not all of the cracks were able to be smoothed out. No matter how hard I tried, people still looked at me like I was a counterfeit piece of art. A fraud, a copycat. They could tell I didn't belong, and I didn't understand why. As a result, I perfected my craft and was able to eventually blend in, much like a chameleon. The first time I realized I might've lost my true self wasn't until my freshman year of college. I was having a mental break and tried to see a university-appointed psychologist. When I told her that I had A, she flat out told me she didn't believe me. he went so far as to tell me that I may have been misdiagnosed. This sent me into a downward spiral. I began to question my identity. I had tried so hard to blend in and erase my Autistic traits that were seen as ""undesirable"" and ""not socially acceptable,"" and I guess I had reached my goal. However, I didn't expect *this* kind of reaction. I thought I'd be complimented on my ""coping skills,"" but instead I got slapped with this. It made me angry. It really pissed me off. I had done all that work only for someone to look at me and say ""no, Autism looks like THI."" Ever since then, I've wondered if I'm Autistic enough. I don't even know who I am without that mask anymore. It makes me severely depressed. I was encouraged (and sometimes forced) by NT people to change my behavior to make THEM more comfortable, and now that I have nobody believes me when I tell them my diagnosis. What a joke.

aspergers,"Just curious. Here are some examples I can think of on top of my head: up, one of the biggest complaints about me was that I was too quiet and sometimes got called boring by other adults. I even got told that I was rude even if I was just minding my business. When I was thirteen, my mom's friend would be over for dinner. They were a frequent visitor. During dinner, I made an attempt to be more sociable by trying to be funny, but in a satire kind of way? I guess you would call that dry humor. One night my mom comes in my bedroom to talk about my behavior and says that I've been doing but nag and complain during dinner and that I embarrassed her in front of her friend. I remember being bewildered because I didn't intend to be a complainer but apparently that is how I came off. a teenager, I hoped to hide my AD through masking even though I didn't realize it was a real thing. But I was very bad at it and still not the best at it XD I attempted to make myself more sociable by imitating a stereotypical teenager which is how I thought you were supposed to act. But that backfired when I managed to annoy some friends by coming off as whiny. It was a weird time because I've had a family member tell me that I was too mature and to act more like a teenager. after my diagnosis when I was eleven, it looked like the goal from my family and therapists was to make me more social, so I attempted to act more extroverted and make friends. I tried to make friends with another student who was also new. We did play at recess but many times when I tried to be fun, I ended up weirding her out and I realized I was forcing the friendship. he and I were on good terms by the end of the year even though we haven't spoken since we were kids, but that's just another example.  there are just other mini ones, like me trying to be friendly and accidentally saying the wrong thing. you I've gotten better at not being so much of a complainer over the years. I also just keep my mouth shut more often even during parties and gatherings. I catch myself rambling about a special interest or trying too hard to be sociable. ometimes nowadays as an people react better to me being quiet. Despite those who do complain about me talking enough, I'd rather be known as the chill quiet person than an obnoxious weirdo.Has your attempts at being more sociable ever backfired on you?",1634857238,2369,457

aspergers,"Hello, started a new job on Monday at a small office (there’s only a team of about 12 people including me). Everyone is really nice, (I’m 22F btw), I’m the youngest by a few years but everyone really gets along, they’re all very nice. this week they have been talking about a Halloween party, at first I couldn’t work out who was hosting it but one of my co-workers (I think she’s in her 40s, she’s really nice to me, treats me like her daughter sort of thing) said it was by boss who is hosting it. Apparently she has a really big house and hosts a lot of events in her garden. My co worker says she’s sure I will be invited, but I’ve been around my boss a lot, she’s even talked about Halloween, but she hasn’t invited me yet. not the fact that I really want to go to this specific party, I’m just worried about feeling left out. It makes me really anxious, embarrassment is my biggest trigger for panic attacks and breakdowns and if I’m the only one in the office not invited that’s how i’ll feel.  understand I’m new and she has no obligation to invite me, but I’m in the office 9 hours a day five times a week, and my desk is less than two metres away from her, and we chat a lot about stuff. I also overheard the others are bringing plus ones.  Friday’s the office goes to the local pub at lunchtime so I’m hoping it will be brought up then. I was technically on “probation” this week (they call it work experience) but they (my boss and her deputy) said it’s more to see if I like the job rather than if they like me. I was thinking maybe she may wait to see if I confirm I’m staying before inviting me, but she has made a few comments implying I’m going to be staying beyond this week, so idk. just feel really stupid, because I’m 22 and I feel really childish, but the situation is making me a bit anxious and tense at work.

I'm constantly insecure about myself. I have never even gotten an official diagnosis for Asperger's, and because I'm legally an adult now, I don't even know if I can. It's like I'm supposed to be happy now, but I'm not. I haven't used Reddit in a while because I felt that I did awful things against other people's wills, and it just made me feel harassed and angry. I also needed storage space on my phone, so I deleted it (I'm using Reddit on desktop now). remember being in 5th grade and my mom kept telling me that I need to ""make friends"" and ""talk to people more"". I didn't do that because I just happened to be in a class that none of my ""real friends"" were in. I was addicted to Animal Crossing: New Leaf on 3D. My parents and even my grandpa were worrying about me because I didn't want to make friends and I just wanted to play a video game because I guess it was my special interest at the time. I remember one time when I stayed the night at my grandpa's house, my mom came to pick me up, and I just happened to be in the bathroom. When I got out, my mom and grandpa told me something along the lines of ""We need you to promise us you'll make friends"" and I was just kind of confused. I wasn't really interested in the whole ""having friends"" thing. I guess everyone just somehow matured faster than me. I said something like ""Well, I can't do that"" followed by a stifle of laughter. I eventually started crying because I didn't know what my family wanted from me. My mom just told me to not worry about it. he's explained to me that I have Autism and what it was, and everything made so much more sense to me. It just sucks having it as an adult because you feel ""slow"". I'm an adult. I expected myself to move out on my own because I wanted to be responsible like everyone else. I took community college classes in high school to get ahead and just help myself with college since no one else in my family did that or had the opportunity to do it.

Because of this I kept doing YouTube videos on tech and cyber security until a few years back.

Anyways, I found out many companies like P&amp;G instead of making things they let inventors bring items to them and if the company likes an item then you will get a royalty contract. This basically means for every unit they sell (keep in mind they are already in stores like Walmart). You get a given %. Normally cents per unit, but it adds up quickly. After doing research seasonal items like in the dollar store you are expecting $10k in royalties. Anyways, I gotten no deals from this. I still have some products I want to try, but it has been about a year since I tried.   1. This is one of the products I tried to get companies to pick up. I even had a PPA and tried my hardest. [   2. Another thing [7. I tried art but haven't sold a single painting, stock photo, or anything.   1. here is an example of a stock photo I tried to sell [8. I tried writing books in the past, but never finished one. I'm trying again, but I don't expect much from it. Writing is one of the few things I always hated doing.9. I've been investing into the stock market and other things since I was 18. I did make some money off of this. But I never had a lot to start off with. Like my average is about 20% or 30% ROI per year. I have to look it up. But I started with $300 and always had a hard time getting more money. o like 10% of $100 just means before taxes and fees you gain $10.10. During my degrees and even shortly after I tried heavily to get a fully remote job with a startup. At one point I put in 10k applications a month.  Many times places would list they wanted fully remote, and on the interview they would reverse that. is other things, but I mostly have given up at this point. Like I have stuff out there and again I'm still trying in some small way. But at this point between all the problems I had trying to do it the normal way and all the problems I tried doing it this other way. I'm nearing the life expectancy of us. And while I don't expect something to happen when it comes to that. After this many years of trying and meeting failure after failure. At this point I would be just happy with taking care of my parents, their dogs, helping out as much as I can, and spend as much time as I can with them while they are here. Because after that, IDK if I will keep going or if that will be the end of my chapter too. At this point I just hope one of these investments pays off in a serious way. That away my parents won't have to worry about me being homeless. I noticed my mental (memory, time it takes me to understand something, and so on) is degrading. I just hope I have the money in 5 years to do things with my parents like take them overseas or go on a train ride vacation. Maybe I will luck out and will have enough to do things like that and have a nice stable happy life .....For other autistic adults, what out of the box things are you doing or have you done to get/earn a normal life",1634792623,6095,1219

aspergers,"hort preface: I've worked in queer spaces for ages (and by a short definition I'm a gay cis man who passes as white, while also being Native, and within the context of this post of course this is a question.). now the issue. never even thought about my gender until recently. It was a vague sense to me throughout life (but, also since I'm a cis man, amab, I just kind of went with what I was told without thought) well... In the last few weeks I just realized gender makes no sense to me.  work with so many people (and have so many friends) who experience gender fiercely, be it their gender assigned at birth, or their gender discovered throughout their life. I think I understand how they perceive gender, and it doesn't make sense to me.  understand how important that is to them. And I will literally break my soul to make sure their gender is represented and supported within the piece of reality I have any say over. just do not understand what gender is. And I literally have no concrete sense of what it means to me.  the moment I see it as something related to a sense of being within society. I get the zeitgeist of expectations of men and women, and how some of those ideals may be variably important to someone who understands themselves in that gender construct. Like, if you perceive your gender a certain way there's a mile and half long (albeit confused and complicated) script about what you do. I also understand that you may feel the gender and might break that script. Within that, I understand that gender can be a performance (expression). I think I logically understand how gender identity is perceived and how gender expression is accepted. just... don't understand how or where I fit there.  time I see a talk about gender it's about presentation (expression?) or sense of self (identity? related to how you function socially) and I get those spectrums. I see and feel how strongly my peers experience them. But I honestly can only express sympathy. I attempt empathy I just get a null result in my brain. yeah, I thought about posting this on an LGBT forum (and I will) but at least at this moment I feel like my frustration around understanding of gender is less related to me in a queer space and is more related to my AD. o I posted here first.Um...

aspergers,"  everyone! The first thing that I should mention is that my aspergers is mild to the point where peers, co-workers, and strangers view me as ""normal"" or in other words, like anybody else. I graduated high school a year and a half ago, and I attended community college for a year. The reason why I want to give online dating a try is because I don't have many ways of meeting girls my age; I go to the gym, work at the grocery store ( A few of us there get together every once in awhile and hangout, see movies etc) and I do occasional things with my family. I don't have a friend group, but I still have like two good friends that I stay in touch with and hangout on occasion. I'm trying to ask is, should I even consider dating online? I'm sorta good at small talk, I am better at holding conversations now, and in the past I have had girls that liked me. But I have never had a girlfriend. I really would want to date someone that is NT, I had this one girl last year that wanted to date me, but she had a lot going on in her life and she also had aspergers, but I don't think I need to let everyone know her life story on here. What would work best when it comes to building a online dating profile? What do I need to avoid in order to be successful at this? I want is to find a woman that I would feel comfortable around, feel attracted to, and most importantly accepts me for who I am. I feel like I know some of the basics as to what a woman likes. I just want to have a successful relationship and hopefully marriage.How would I go about dating, online? Looking for advice (20M)",1634782712,1586,314

aspergers,"Hi, I’m 17yr (f) and I was formally diagnosed with AD when I was 16yrs. I’m the first AD person in my family and hadn’t even heard of AD before my diagnosis so I’ve spent the last year learning about AD and what it looks like for me.  is one ‘symptom’ that I’m unsure about, I’m unsure whether this is an AD symptom or if it’s a comorbid condition.  can’t pinpoint when this started but I think I was 13yrs as that is when H started. I have cycles of extreme low mood, I’ve recently started tracking them and on average they are 50 days apart and last between 8-11 days. A few days leading up to these cycles I begin to feel low, then it feels like a switch is flicked and I feel extremely low have T and can’t imagine feeling any other way. Through this cycle my mood isn’t consistently extremely low, I quickly switch between feeling extremely low and feeling ‘ok’. By ‘ok’ I don’t mean happy, it feels like baseline but not my normal baseline if that makes sense? When I switch to feeling ‘ok’ I feel like I was being very dramatic and I can’t remember what it was like to feel that way. I’m aware that I felt extremely low and had T and possibly H but I don’t remember what that felt like despite it happening just moments or minutes earlier. The next 3-5 days after this cycle I’m emotionally drained but I feel my normal baseline again. It’s taken me a while to start tracking these lows because after it’s happened it feels like it’s never happened and I kind of forget about it. These lows started to feel more cyclical around 15yrs and the lows have gotten worse in intensity as the years have gone on. Ive tried 5 different antidepressants all of which had no effect aside from the last one I tried (Effexor) which made me incredibly nauseous less than an hour after taking it, it also made my head feel busier but nothing extreme. Ive been researching to see whether this is connected to my AD for months but I’ve found nothing. If anyone experienced something similar I’d be extremely grateful if you could reply. I’m happy to answer questions if that would be helpful. I’m extremely grateful for any advice, thank you for taking the time to read this. forgot to mention, but I know that this isn’t burnout or sensory overload since these 3 things look so different for me. These lows are cycles whereas sensory overload and burnout only happen when triggered. During sensory overload and burnout I don’t have T or H, these things only happen during this low cycle. I have a family history of MDD (grandparents) however I’m not sure if that would look different for me since I’m autistic (I’m the first person in my family to be autistic.) My first question though was whether this is an AD symptom and whether any other autistic people have this. If anyone diagnosed with both AD and MDD feel this resonates with how MDD affects you I’d really appreciate it if you could comment.Could this be an ASD trait?",1634757472,2919,537

It is not like they say, that it's a result of some great ignorance that there is so much suffering in the human world. People dont care. In fact they enjoy the pain, suffering and humiliation of others. Read about serial killers, this is the extreme. You, as a hypersensitive person, represent the other extreme. Most people are something from the between. But the average people are not like you anymore than they are like those serial killers. You can (and will) become like them up to a point. But you are not going to like the process.  no reason to let your ego bloat over being different. You are not some kind of a heavenly angel made flesh. In many ways you are just a pathetic weakling.

Everyone's a little crazy, right? o we're hanging oit for a year, playing an occasional show or two. Decide to get a place so we can practice. He was tryna get out of his parents place, i was tryna finally move out on my own. Heres where shit started getting kinda fucky. I was planning on waiting a bit to move until i had extra money saved up.  I tell B that i aint quite ready to move yet. Dude fucking blows up over the phone about how he cant keep waiting and, i shoulda hung up the phone and said fuck off right then and there. But i wanted to do music, thought it was my fault for not wanting to make change so i went with it.  are fine for a while, but not long after, B flips out over me apparently using too much tp. Goes on about how other people in the past fucked him over ( a common theme throughout this) I start buying all the TP so he'll chill out.  it becomes other shit. I'm washing dishes, high as hell not realizing im taking a long time, bit whatever, im tryning to be thorough as before ive only used a dishwasher. B starts freaking out beacuse its been an hour and starts this semi-incoherent rant about everything from ""time is money"" to how he used to get beat over dishes, which is granted, an atrocity, but then i says ""geuss im overreacting a bit"" To which i reply ""yeah you kinda are"" which sends him into another spiral.  arguments follow over various things. One time dude was talking about something, i was making my tea, drop my infuser down in the cup, dude accuses me of slamming it and when i tell him im not, he accuses me of gaslighting (another common theme throughout all this) One conversation which i thought was chill, he asked me what i thought heaven looked like"" I said ""i donr belive in a heaven so nothing""Dude got super offened beacuse i didnt give him the answer he wanted.  honestly cant remember everything that has occured thus far.  i myself am not without meltdowns or mental issues. But mine usually involve hitting myself or breaking my own property.  Im a messy person, i dont really think to clean my area, so that becomes a point of contention which to be fair, i understand. I dont know why i dont clean or do dont clean good enough when i so. That's always been an issue. All on me.  everytime there's an argument, dude holds that over my head. He also tends to over psycho-anylize everything anyone says and no matter how off base his conclusion is, belives it to be absolutely true. He also likes to turn anything around and try to make it either my fault or everyone's fault with some half assed non apology.  are two numorous to listLaundry is another sore point. I typically grab my shit for the week, and wheel what i can to the laundromat nearby.Dude has an issue wirh me not bringing enough towels so im like whatever, pack what i can fit and wash those too. I go to grab some shit and do laundry, dude says ""oh are you gonna grab some towels too"" in a pissy, accusatory ,""youre not gonna do it tone of voice"" At this point ive had enough so im like ""yeah i planned on it, and i dont like the implication that i dont""  turned into a shouting match resulting in a violent physical altercation. forward a bit. My friend A moves in from a previous state. Everything's chill. Then dude misplaces a bottle of wees and subtly implies A stole it, Which granted it coulda got mixed up with anyone's. But i know A very well, hell do without. He doesnt steal. Most likley B misplaced it but seems convinced somone took it. And every time he looses something now, its become a thing of him accusing people of stealing and when we tell him that no one touched his shit, he again says ""well i feel gaslighted and lied to""  he misplaced some video games, comes in the room I share with A,  implying thhat hes being scrwed over but in a way that he xan deny accusing anyone. Then he mubles something about ""thrown away as a revenge tactic"" Which neither obe of us would have done. I know for a fact my friend A did NOT take his games and pawn em or some shit. I know the guy well, plus had he stolen and pawned anything, he wouldn't be broke and stretching his meager paycheck as far as he has to. A doesn't do any hard drugs, so wouldnt be stealing shit for drug money. But B seems convinced and absolutely paranoid. Always brings up shit that happened to him in the past and projects that.

aspergers,"ome background. The last time I read a novel, was many years ago.  I have poor executive function. If I don't see immediate success, I give up easily.  The only time I wrote a script, was during an English lesson, at school, many years ago.  Also, I very rarely socialise, if at all. have ideas, for screenplays and when I sent a tweet, to Luke Jennings, about an idea I had, for a script, he said it was a good one.  The trouble is, because I don't socialise, or have many NT friends, I have a feeling that I can't be a scriptwriter. be a scriptwriter, a person has to be into reading and have a good social life, which are criteria that I don't meet.  I have ideas, but it's putting them down, 'on paper', that I will find challenging.  Ideally, I would come up with the ideas and someone else, (an NT), would write the scripts for me.  But this will never happen.  The scripts are inside my head and I play them out - what the characters look like, the settings, everything.

First thing I noticed from interviews was eye contact. I get that sometimes people are distracted or something, even NTs arent gonna have perfect eye contact. But there was definitely 2-3 interviews he consistently not trying to make eye contact. econd his obession level. He has made jokes about his obsession with the sport and its known in the wrestling community that he is unatrually obsessed.

Last monday him and I spent like 15 minutes in the sauna and he had the same song om repeat the whole time. I talk with another guy on the team and he goes oh yeah he does that.

Found out I caught the Aspergers at age 10 (obvs a joke) when I switched to public from private school and the teachers/ parents started to wonder why I was so damn weird. They sent me to a few therapists who couldn't figure it out until a they gave me a full IQ test. They found out that I was off the charts in things like math and problem solving but I was seriously below average in my social skills and understanding body language, things like that. That in addition to a meeting with a doctor and psychiatrist they determined I was on the Aspergers autism spectrum. Luckily my parents were pretty good like %80 of the time. They kind of had the attitude of ""oh well guess he's got Aspergers darn"" and let me be myself. a lot of you I've struggled greatly with love and lust in the age of loneliness. Found it impossible to get the time of day from a girl until I was probably 20. I came into my own, found my look, lost a bunch of weight, and suddenly as if by magic could get some traction with females. I had my fun, but the entire time I really wanted a relationship. o far there has been four that have been shut down, close up shop, forever and ever type women that have each ended catastrophically in there own spectacular unique ways. Three are stories for another day. I really don't know what my deal is, I don't get on with many people and far fewer romantically but when I do I seem to get attached. I still have yet to have a serious girlfriend, its been many several week flings or ""dates"" that were code for hooking up. More than a few times I've found myself unknowingly on the wrong side of a rebound. ometimes I think I crave the attention, to have someone want to ask me what I'm thinking about, or miss me, or hang out with me in the daytime. I can't seem to read the signs, and then get blindsided by an inevitable split. It usually puts me in a huge funk for what seems like forever. It hadn't happened in almost a year but it happened again. amazing. Definitely passes the vibe check. I don't really want to say too much because privacy but we got along great, some similar interests but different enough to keep it interesting.

I threw up one final hail mary about a week later because I thought she was making a mistake. No dice. It fucked up my whole summer 11/10 bad funk. Fast forward to earlier this month. We match on tinder, and we start talking again. Get together later that week and have an awesome time. Couple weeks and hangs later I make mention of being more serious and get shut down hard again, bring on the funk.

Dont get me wrong id get fun stuff too.   due to that fact and me trying to seem like a “normal person” in public so i didnt embarrass them even in my 20s.   i realize last night that this isnt right.  I was raised to be friendly with people talk to them make sure “you seem normal enough” but over the years when i get excited on subjects i just run on and on with them and people normally dont like the subjects im talking about. Normally i talk about things i find interesting online.  Due to that and me trying to make people like me and think im normal i push people wrong i guess and annoy them. I have had many people who have told me that “i wish can you please be quiet i dont care about this topic as it has nothing to do with me”  basically on a weekly basis someone in my life will tell me that.  From my husband telling me he loves me and he understands that i dont mean it that im just a bit to much for him right now. To my roomie . We added on a friend of my husband who basicly told me that she doesnt care about this topic because it flat out has nothing to do with her and her life.   I hit a actually break down and went upstairs and went into tears she im not sure realized but she left less than 5 minutes later while i was shutting down my computer.  was informed that i do not need to try to be friends with anyone or try to talk to them if i didnt want to by my husband  if i want to sit in the corner or if i want to do something else i can do that i do not have to be friendly and try to be normal for his friends.  And he said in the end he doesnt care what they think of me because hed choose my side over them in the end so if i end up being to much for them id aways get his side. issue im getting is how hard it is to untrain myself.

I feel like my feeling of not fitting in and being a little alien/robot only gets worse as I get older too and it is something I'm struggling with.  catch is I feel like I am still relatively high-functioning (which is why I have thought about aspergers instead of somewhere """"lower"""" on the spectrum -- not sure what verbiage to use here, I'm sorry). I can drive, I can hold jobs, I can maintain relationships (with a bit of effort), I go to college and excel there. I have a career path laid out in front of me at the moment. People know I am socially awkward, but otherwise not much of the previous is on display, publically anyway. I only really have a meltdown if I am utterly overwhelmed with many stressors at once, which very rarely happens and if it does, it happens at home.  is mainly the social aspects that trip me up and have always been the issue, we're talking since I was a child... I was an odd as f\*\*\* child with hardly any social skills and am kinda shocked no one questioned it. Like many people on the spectrum, it feels like regular societal rules and expectations were not built into me and I either have to mask, or really genuinely work on making things feel as natural as possible for myself. I find it hard to relate to people unless it's something I've specifically been through, but of course I can still empathize. I don't have a flow when it comes to conversation or interaction, I am aware I come off ""some type of way"" due to people's facial expressions sometimes but it is hard for me to pinpoint exactly what I said or maybe how I said it that was the issue, as I feel I've still made \*some\* progress from putting the work in to stop these things from happening. basically my question is, what is the best path here? If I know I struggle with some things (and there are things I haven't mentioned in the post obviously) would a diagnosis be worth it for someone like me? I don't need accommodations for my jobs or school or anywhere else; I think at this point it would just be a good little ""explainer"" if people were truly wondering about certain traits of mine or why I act certain ways, plus it would give me piece of mind and maybe lead me towards better coping mechanisms (???) and learning. My spouse has been with me forever and has never judged any of my ""quirks,"" so I guess that means something if she has tolerated me for this long, hah. I told her about all this and she asked me ""If you ultimately got a diagnosis, is it because you want help, or because you just want to learn how to cope with it?"" And I couldn't give her a straight answer because I really don't know what I want. I know there are not meds for this either but there are for other comorbidites, which I also have and have received treatment for in the past (and make sense now if this diagnosis is accurate). a random note I feel it may be a family thing too. I have thought that my uncle was quite possibly aspbergers/autistic, but much, MUCH worse off than me -- incredibly intelligent, supercomputer-brain guy and had VERY intense interests and obsessions (I am talking hoarder-levels with certain hobbies) but also had next to no social skills and lived as a hermit who had some kid-like interests until he died -- and he died an early death because he did not want to seek help from others or have that much interaction with anyone at all and was just very angrily ""done."" And when I did a 23andMe for myself and my mom earlier this year, my mom came back with a higher propensity for autism specifically in Promethease too. I didn't, but I thought that was interesting anyway that for me, at least, some sort of genetic component could exist? opinions?curious about diagnosis benefits / rambling (long)",1634685414,4382,811

aspergers,"Good evening folks, as long as I can remember I have been unable to watch pretty much anything even remotely close to horror. This includes anything ranging from stuff like zombies to more extreme horror stories. While it'll be somewhat fine while watching it, my mind will just obsessively return to it for days or even weeks or months afterwards. When I was around 10 I watched the Lord of the Rings movies for the first time. This included the Orc Army about to attack Minas Tirith. For some odd reason I was deadly afraid of orcs marching down the street to my home for literal months afterwards, with it sometimes being bad enough to render me unable to sleep until 2 or 3 at night. Rationally I knew that orcs did not exist and that the chances of them walking up to my house are about 0, but my mind would not stop worrying about it, mainly centring about ""but what if?"" .  a year and a half later I watched a movie that involved zombies for the first time. BIG mistake on my part. The movie would run fairly late so I had to watch half of it that day, and half of it the next.  My mother said she was going to bed and I continued to watch the movie until the next ad break. Right before the break occurred the zombies were introduced by having them fairly visibly mauling a guy to death. ince I had to go to bed that was the point where I had to stop watching and I got up to go upstairs. As I opened the door to the hall my mum was standing in the shadow and making generic zombie noises which scared the daylight out of me. ame as with the orcs before I was deadly afraid for literal months that the zombie apocalypse would be here any moment now, despite rationally knowing that that was complete and utter nonsense.  luckily the effects have become a lot less severe as I got older, now it only lasts for a couple of days, it is really annoying, especially because I never really know what might set it off. Orcs? Nowadays fine. Zombies? ometimes fine, but mostly not, I really had a couple of bad nights after watching episode 5 of the Marvel What If...? series a couple of weeks ago. General horror stuff? Generally a big no-no. At the same time I have no problem whatsoever with for example the ghouls and feral ghouls from the Fallout franchise, despite them being not too different in characteristics from zombies. in all it is a really annoying thing and I suspect that it is, at least in part, caused by my Asperger's (Technically I was diagnosed with AD almost two years ago, but I was also told that had they still used DM-IV it would have been Asperger's.) At the same time I was wondering if there were others in this community that struggled with the same issue for the same or a different reason.Overactive imagination and horror stories or movies.",1634681135,2773,519

I'm a bit of a musician, so I learned to play the song on guitar &amp; piano; I have found that playing music helps with my anxiety - likely due to bilateral stimulation; I'm noticing that whenever I'm feeling heightened stress/anxiety, and that song starts auto-repeating in my mind (at high volume), my hands start to mimic the motion of the guitar/piano technique; become kind of automatic and looks weird to my wife; it got me wondering, is what I'm experiencing, this automatic muscle memory that helps me with anxiety - is that similar to stimming? does stimming feel like to someone who does it more typically and pronounced?Question about stimming",1634678879,1050,178

Anyways, in researching examples of and symptoms of masking, I realized that this is how I live my entire life everyday. My number 1 task is appearing normal to NTs (I do a really BAD job anymore) so they are more comfortable, and it causes an unbelievable amount of stress for me that NTs just don't understand.

aspergers,"I am 24 years old, live in the UK and have autism spectrum disorder. I am high functioning. I've worked professional jobs and have done quite well in them, and now I am in my final year of university studying a healthcare subject. a child, everything was confusing. As a teenager, life was a survival pit. I'll tell you guys something... ocial skills do improve. You get exposed to a lot of social situations the more you go out to see them, and you get desensitised to the anxiety and shyness. You get better at talking to people as you practice, and I'd say by the age of 25, maybe 30, you've pretty much seen every social situation you need to see to know how to act in all situations. said, autism isn't just a low social IQ. You don't just eventually figure it out and that's it. ocial situations aren't maths equations or the human body that follows certain laws of nature. ocial situations are not just complex, but ever changing and unpredictable. need to constantly pay attention and use exhausting amounts of cognitive effort to come across as a neurotypical person. If you don't come across as a neurotypical person, you get rejected and bullied out of an environment. the thing. I'm still only 24, but I've learnt that I'm always gonna struggle socially. I have got to a stage where only autism specialists or family members of autistic people can tell I am autistic, but it's still pretty tiring to be social sometimes. always going to struggle but I've just accepted that. I have laws in place to prevent discrimination or unfair dismissal at work against me, some companies will hire me just because I'm autistic to meet their bullshit virtue signalling quotas, and there turns out to be a fair amount of quite good people in the world for me to be good friends with. a lot of people aren't gonna like me or find me weird. I've just stopped caring. By stopping caring, I can put my cognitive energy into my work now. not caring anymore, 50% of the problem has been solved. By just living long enough and having more experience, the other 50% of the problem has been solved. I can safely say I am doing quite well socially and a lot of people consider me to be quite intelligent, although I'm certain I'd be on the lower end of average if I did an IQ score, I'm doing quite well. give up.

I hate everything about it, everything from not being able to have a simple conversation with another human being, to not being able to do simple everyday things without overcomplicating it.

I hate not being comfortable with intimacy to the point of being unable to give my family members a proper hug or even hold someones hand.    the worst part about this whole thing? I seem to be completely unable to ""accept"" it. Why can't I just accept that this is who I am and how I am? Why do I  feel so trapped? Why do I feel like it's not suppose to be like this?

aspergers,"I know every person is different, ND or NT, but I was hoping to at least get some ideas here. (NT) guy (ND) is very stressed out with work.  When he's pressed for deadlines (which is the situation for at least a couple of weeks now) he gets really impatient and tend to be short with me, does not like to be interrupted with calls/texts (and can be rude about it), and can be inflexible, or unreasonable even.  If we have to be at a certain place at a certain time for an activity after work to unwind, I can't be late or he'll be pissed.  Doesn't matter if it was because I was working late.  When we're physically together he doesn't like to be touched......I get it.  He's anxious and overwhelmed.  I can see that he tries, makes sure that he allocates time for me and I can tell that he wants to spend time with me, but he's unpleasant to be around.  I try to talk to him about his work but he doesn't want to talk about it because it stresses him out even more.  Eventually, he brings it up, so I ask questions which he begrudgingly answers.   o I just stop asking him about his day/week, but then I feel bad because it seems like I don't care (also I'd like to know more about what's causing his stress, but I can't).  He invites me to spend the night but then on top of him being irritable, he has a hard time falling and staying asleep because of the stress/anxiety.  I feel bad for waking him up when  making slight movements when we're sleeping.  When I get frustrated because of his attitude and choose to not spend the night (because I also get stressed out when I think about waking him up), he feels rejected....... I don't know what to do.  I know he's aware of it because there's been a few times when he apologizes the next day for his attitude, but what am I supposed to do when this is happening?

It just really bothers me to think that it’s what the channel is really on even though I’m watching a recording. also have this thing where sometimes I actually find watching shows on streaming services like Netflix or Hulu depressing because it’s not live TV being broadcast in real time. It feels “canned” and lonely. It’s kind of hard to explain such abstract and bizarre feelings about a non-living thing so maybe I’m not making sense. actually literally just occurred to me as I’m writing this that I think I actually see television as this living thing that’s my friend.

aspergers,"Hey all, ironically, this throwaway account was originally made to discuss pot and it's effects because I was simply not having the same experience everyone else was, and I was confused. OUT! I have Asperger's. o now a whole new set of questions popped into my head my googlefu can't seem to find answers, so here I am! #1: you feel you always need a ""bigger dose"" than your peers who consume roughly as often? I didn't start using pot until my early 30s, and started with edibles. I needed 50mg just to experience my first-ever high, and today, I need like 150mg to even get a really decent worthwhile recreational high. (For smokers, this is roughly 1.5 and 4.5 joints respectively) #2: call it the ""Feeling of now-ness"", and every pothead I've asked thinks I'm explaining it wrong or I'm being goofy. It's a weird feeling, somewhere when I'm starting to calm down. It's relaxing and calm, but more importantly, I suddenly feel EXTREMELY aware I exist in this place, in this room, and around these things. It's a feeling of ""being in the moment"", I suppose? I have never, not once, in my entire life felt this before pot, and I only feel it with pot. To me, it heavily implies a ""this is what normal people feel like?"" moment, but I'm sure that's not accurate. #3 two versions of myself inside me"". This ones a bit weird, it's like, one part of me is stoned off my ass in fairytale land, the other half is still sober, keeping watch. It's like I always have a ""little sober me"" somewhere in the back giving me directions, so I don't get into trouble. I know this sounds like a conscious, but it's not like that. It really feels like there's a literal part of me still able to ""be sober and rational"" so the rest of me doesn't have to. thought: Am I just not completely letting go? Maybe thats why I need bigger doses?) #4 you have trouble following along with TV shows and movies while stoned? I mean, duh, memory is impaired. But do you feel it's significantly worse for you than others? Like with me, sometimes I can't recite any details about a movie I just watched the night before, if I watched it stoned completely off my ass. Yet, others I was with equally or more stoned can, even if the details are fuzzy. example, I recently watched ""tranger Than Fiction"" for the first time ever last week, while completely stoned. &gt;!All I remember is its a weird romcom where the main character's life is being narrated, and he figures it out eventually. !&lt; Question #5 of my biggest emotional/aspie breakthroughs happen while stoned.

Though I do appreciate her effort. It's just that I love my dad immensely and me not needing emotional support doesn't mean I don't love him.  hasn't said any of this, has cast no judgement, but I know how her brain works.

aspergers,"orry for the long post, here's the details.  27M, living in North Carolina. I'm a mechanical engineer, married to 26F, guardian of 15M brother-in-law, have some friends, and have plenty of special interests to indulge in. Despite having some friends and a partner, I'm pretty much a social failure. Bottom of any social hierarchy I find myself in. I've just setup my life in a way to be independent while avoiding social hierarchies. (Financially stable as working level engineer and not interested in advancing into management.) proud of how far I've gotten, but it came with great difficulty. When I was 25 I was seeing a counselor for anxiety and personal issues. My counselor suggested I may have Asperger's and had me take the Aspie quiz. I tested as having Asperger's and dove into research.  read ""A Complete Guide to Asperger's"" by Tony Atwood, watched countless videos and read countless articles, interacted with this sub and r/aspiememes, and tested on the spectrum on several other online tests. I'm pretty confident in my ""guided-diagnosis"" from the counselor, but obviously this is not an official diagnosis.  hesitant to pursue a diagnosis for several reasons. Fear of ""seeming too normal"" and having to talk to multiple psychiatrists until someone takes me seriously. Fear that it will take years (someone on here said it took them 20 years, wtf). General anxiety about going to doctors and walking through the process.. But most importantly is that I'm not sure it would serve me any benefit in my personal situation. I'm fortunate enough to not need any accomodations that my friends and family can't provide. diagnosis surely would have helped me early in life. I struggled to accept myself, and I didn't understand myself at all until the counselor suggested I was on the spectrum. And I still struggle with social anxiety every day. From my own research I've become more comfortable with myself and happier than I've ever been.. I suppose there is also a fear of finding out that I'm wrong about all of this, and having to start my journey of self-realization all over again. what do you think, is there some benefit to a diagnosis that I am overlooking? Am I foolish to be confident in a self-diagnosis without seeking one?

They are normal not in what may be called the absolute sense of the word; they are normal only in relation to a profoundly abnormal society.

aspergers,"To clarify, I don’t want to offend anyone and I understand why “low functioning” isn’t the best term. However, I was called out once for saying I have mild autism because “autism is autism”. I disagree. I’ve seen people higher up on the spectrum and they have higher needs than me. I’ve also seen people higher on the spectrum than myself who are able to mask their traits a lot better than myself. Obviously everyone with autism deserves support in dealing with their difficulties but it’s naive to pretend severe forms of autism don’t exist. I fully acknowledge that whether my needs are higher than the average neurotypical, there are people who have it far worse than I do. I feel like people want to sugarcoat autism which is completely disregarding the struggles of those with more severe forms. The vast majority of autistic people online have it mild to moderate and it means that their activism never covers the full autistic community.Why are “functioning labels” considered offensive by the wider autism community?",1634567003,1025,173

The other Aspie and his girlfriend got up and say they were leaving, Brad got up and went for a hug but he said he didn’t like touching. Brad got back to his seat, look me dead in the eyes and said “I fucking hate autistic people”. My brain yelled HOLD UP! I stared at him and replied “dude, I’m autistic”. And then he said the most idiotic thing ever “no you’re not, you are looking me in the eye. He didn’t even do that! They all act high and mighty, thinking they’re so superior.” By then I was praying to any god for my friend to get his ass out of that bowling ally so we could leave.

For one, we both exist on a spectrum that isn’t entirely black or white. Just as no neurodivergent person is alike, no one in the LGBTQIA+ community is exactly alike. It’s impossible to sort everyone into “high-functioning or low-functioning” and “gay and straight”. Additionally, society as a whole has tried to cure both homosexuality and neurodivergence instead of accepting it or promoting awareness. Conversion therapy is still legal in over a a dozen states, and the infamous Autism peaks organization has no board members on the spectrum and solely focuses on curing our condition as if it makes us a burden on society. LGBTQIA+ people are often told that “being gay is a choice”, while neurodivergents are expected to simply “act normal”. Lastly, these communities are not mutually exclusive, and I’ve personally noticed that there’s a lot of overlap between the two.

The most clear example was being grounded for 6 months from my PC/Internet, as an (unknown to me then) Asperger's Kid. o basically, I was being cut off from an overwhelming majority of my entire social structure. Note this was before social media and smart phones. No PC means no internet what so ever in any capacity. my logic was ""Your punishment is illogical and nonsense, no one can honestly be expected to obey. I won't"", and just like that, I simply didn't listen. It was a cold, calculated decision, not one made out of anger, but logic.

' ok are we going to do something about these antisocial traits?' and he just laughs... he laughs and he goes 'but youre not antisocial. youre autistic'. and whenever i open up about what would someone consider as antisocial, he laughs. i punch doors and walls, i do have the bad habbit of picking on people cos i cant put myself in their shoes and he just laughs. i do think these are antisocial traits and not my autism. so im sometimes wondering is he playing with me because he deep inside, believes i have antisocial traits and he sees me as an experiment? whenever i ask him he always denies that i am cluster b, and he says its always my autism. last week, i told him this......'i had a friend with this X disorder, who kept embarassing me and i dislike people with that disorder', and his response was 'well. guess. you HAVE that disorder. uh huh. ive been considering this for a while. you have this and autism' (its a disorder he never said before that i have and was never mentioned during our therapy). i feel he did for revenge? cos i spoke badly about this disorder? he hasnt helped me much with my aspergers (im questioning if i even have it now). but he does seem interested when i talk and i dont know what to think. maybe im paranoid for overthinking this, but it just seems weird no?i think my therapist is playing mind games with me",1634477015,2719,517

aspergers,"Guys. I want to save you a lot of time here. have ADHD. I have autism. I have dyspraxia. are the 3 big ""hidden disabilities"", i.e. we are too ""clever"" to be seen as ""disabled"" people accuse us of being ""lazy"", ""arrogant"", ""try harder to pay attention"", ""go get a job, you bum"" type of stuff If you have any of these 3 conditions, your HORT-TERM, WORKING MEMORY is impaired. if the average person could hold 7 things in their working memory. quite possible that maybe we can hold 3 things, 2 things, 4 things. I don't know precisely how many. are, quite simply, a ""low RAM computer"". you are a ""low RAM computer"", you are never going to be able to ""work things out quickly on the spot"". you try to ""work things out in advance"", this is like, when a computer runs out of RAM, and it transfers memory back and forth from the hard drive, and notice how slow that is? you ever seen this on your computer? When it runs out of RAM? Then it uses hard drive as RAM. Then it's really slow? Yeah, that's us. Our strength with autism, is that we have a great, phenomenal LONG-TERM memory. But here is the problem. If we are stuck in ""observer"" mode, then we never get the DOPAMINE that we need to get things done. way that dopamine works, is like a ""sugar high"". eat some sugar. You get a spike. But then it drops. Now you need to top it up with another high. is how sugar works, doesn't it? that is also how DOPAMINE works. enough, eating sugar actually literally boosts dopamine. know what else boosts dopamine? Doing things! we FAIL at something when doing it, we should then just try again. this can be hard in the workplace, because they fire you if you are too slow. so you practise the job at home. And set up your home just like the workplace. And then practise at home. Once again, though, don't think through HOW to do the job in ADVANCE. Instead, you JUT DO IT. By doing it, you learn where you are going wrong, and you improve. give a really simple example. If you ever worked at a McDonald's. They just literally put you on the restaurant and say ""do it"". There is basically no training. They just put you right into the busy restaurant right away, and just do it you are supposed to do at this McDonald's, is just do something. Just start by making the burger, even guess some ingredients. Making something is better than nothing. Just pick it up, by trial and error, as you go along. are never going to fire you at a McDonald's, because they are so desperate for staff. In some parts of the U, they are literally paying people to show up for a McDonald's interview! In Florida, paying people $50 just to show up! if you can't be bothered to have a full shower. Just get in the shower, and wash just your back with the shower. Hence, even if you aren't perfect in washing your entire body, you at least washed some of it. suspect that we don't like all the turning and twisting, and fine motor movements in the shower. o, just stand in there and wash your back this time around. Next time, get in the shower and wash your front. sure which job is the best one to work? Just pick the first one that sounds plausible! sure which clothes to wear today? Just wear the first ones that fit. sure which girl you want to approach for a date? Just pick the first one. If it fails, pick another one. are people, who, no matter how hard we try, we will ALWAY screw it up the first time. with autism will ALWAY screw it up the first time. WILL fail the first time. once you learn a routine, you will now succeed each day, the first time you do it. how about before you learned that routine? You screwed it up the first time, didn't you? reason we cannot do things in autism, is because we are scared of failing the first time. will ALWAY fail the first time. about talking to other people? you noticed how, if you ask someone a question, many people just say ""no"" by default? They didn't even mean ""no"". They just do it instinctively. might as well ignore whether someone says ""yes"" or ""no"". They are equal to each other. You learn something either way. might as well ignore if you are feeling ""happy"" or ""sad"" today. Instead, ""happy"" and ""sad"" are exactly the same thing. Merge them and all them ""emotion"". And then, anything in between is ""non emotion"". Make it binary. am just saying, from my personal experience, that every time I try to THINK UP IN ADVANCE what to do, I get into ENDLE PERFECTIONIM, ENDLE CHECKING BEHAVIOUR, ENDLE INDECIIVENE. it's deeper than that. brain has already detected that you are ridiculously indecisive. brain has already detected everything that I just wrote. even THINKING ABOUT thinking about things, is already making you anxious. brain has already figured out that it sucks at thinking. Your brain knows that it needs ""trial and error"".  thinking about ""thinking about"", is making an endless anxiety loop. do things. When you fail, and you WILL fail, it then goes into the long-term memory, which is actually what we are amazing at with autism. brain is just a long-term database, chess brain, type thing. We do amazingly in this long-term thing here. We are simply building up, through failure, a long-term database of routines that work and don't. autistic brain is seemingly nothing other than a database of long-term rehearsed routines. like transferring an instruction from hard drive to RAM, and then it just runs. only way to interrupt an instruction in RAM, is basically to ""kill task"" altogether, or shut down the entire computer. is no ability to debate or change the actual task while it is in the process of running in RAM. is why we should just do things. Just do, do, do. We suck at thinking. Just do it.Aspergers is a ""trial and error"" condition. This is the ONLY way you will succeed.",1634451686,5729,1054

aspergers,"For as long as I can remember talking to people fills me with dread and anxiety. I am even afraid of speaking to my parents and siblings who have known me all my life.  fear has kept me from speaking up when I need help, applying for jobs and opportunities, and has caused pointless issues because I simply could not open my mouth to ask a simple question. I am afraid to reply to texts from my friends, even when there is no social obligation or anything really at risk. I am afraid to ask my siblings simple questions like ""What do you want to eat for dinner?"" and telling even my parents things like ""I am hungry."" am afraid to say that I didn't hear or understand something someone said (I strongly believe I have some kind of auditory processing issue but am not officially diagnosed with that).  like a deadline that I keep procrastinating; I procrastinate every conversation, email, or text. And to make matters worse I then forget what I was supposed to speak about. o much so that I miss important details, forget to pay bills and leave friends that I actually like and care about ""on read"" for weeks. It takes me days of psyching myself up to even open an email or a text. hate being afraid of this and I've been trying to think what exactly am I afraid of? Where is the fear coming from? I think I am afraid of people getting mad at me. Ironically, the problems that arise because of my fear of communicating invariably lead to people getting mad at me for not speaking up sooner or letting things go unattended too long. It's a cycle that I have no idea how to get out of.  also think I am afraid of letting people see how ""helpless"" I am. I can come across as intelligent but I can also be stupidly oblivious about very simple things. I can tell I surprise people with my ignorance and I think I am afraid of admitting how much help I really need just to do things that come easily to other people. Maybe I've had too many bad experiences communicating because of my autism and general cluelessness. I can make people mad at me without trying or even understanding why. dream is to be financially independent for the sole purpose of not needing to communicate with people anymore. I'd be happy to live alone, no friends or social interaction apart from my dog. That sounds like the ultimate relief to me but at the same time I want that 'normal' life where I can have friends and form deep relationships. But all of that requires communication. And how can I make money at a job when I can't even bring myself to make an inquiring phone call, write an email or submit an application because I am so afraid of the inevitable socializing that comes next. worst part is, I used to be better at it. I was always afraid, but when I was younger I could still force myself with some effort. Now the fear seems to have grown and is just paralyzing. don't really know if any of this makes sense but I was wondering if anyone has any experience with this and any advice or tips for overcoming it?I'm afraid of communicating with people and it's ruining my relationships, opportunities, and future.

I think he likes me, but I understand it's harder to express one's feelings with autism. He can be quite '""cold"". I realise this is probably me as an NT not understanding him but it hurts. He does things like split EVERYTHING when we go for lunch or coffee and then say ""you can pay me back later"". It feels transactional, like he's keeping a record of how much we each spend. In my past relationships, we've both been happy to treat each other. I buy him treats and sometimes he forgets to even say thank you. I never ask him to pay me back. Or he can watch me, a 110lb woman, struggle to carry something or open complain about how heavy my bag is and he'll never help. He never texts me goodnight or so much as sends a 💛 or an x. He doesn't express his feelings beyond ""you're cute/ I'm glad you're my GF/glad someone finally gave me a chance"". He can drive me home and say ""ok bye"" without so much as a kiss on the cheek. It feels so cold.  also has quirks, again probably driven by AD, that drive me nuts. Like saying ""yum yum"" whenever we eat. Or his super public Twitter and Instagram where he happily posts about loving pegging or other things that are best kept between friends in real life or something. I refuse to tell people who I'm seeing as I don't want them to Google him or find him on social media, he has a huge following. He has said things before about sex and dating being overrated. I can tell he's a genuinely good guy so part of me feels I need to make this work. I feel like it would be wrong of me to try to make him act more NT, because surely being ND is a massive part of who he is? I find certain parts of being on the spectrum endearing- he is hyper intelligent, he has amazing morals, he is very funny, he is super reliable and very thoughtful. hould I just accept I'm too NT or should I communicate I want him to act more romantic etc?Would it be wrong to try to ""change"" my BF with autism?",1634425962,2111,416

aspergers,"Hey all, as I stated in my previous post, I just discovered I have Asperger's, and now I'm running through my life in my head thinking up all these ""is this aspie stuffs?!"" thoughts. I assume everyone in my boat has this revelation, so I thought I'd just make a quick bullet point list of random ""life things"" and ask if anyone can relate? You absolutely don't need to answer all of them, there's a lot.  almost never call people by their name, I didn't know this was an ""Autism thing"". For example, my closest friend (both figuratively and literally) lives across the street, he's an older guy in his retirement years. His name is David, but I call him ""The Neighbor"", even my own wife is ""My Wife"". aying people's names seems weird. I identify people by their role in my life, and that's just what feels natural. (Kinda weird one) know we all get stimulation overload, but I can get by in loud areas. I even worked in aviation for 10 years on an active flightline. It's just annoying. I am \*aware\* all the sounds exist. Do ""NTs"" literally just not process this data? I do. I know it's there. I've just learned to ignore it so I can focus but I'm always 'aware' of it. my readings, it sounds like ""NTs"" literally don't process the information at all, where as ""we"" process all of it, and just brain dump was isn't important. o there's an acknowledgement it exists, and then it's dumped, whereas NTs seem to have no acknowledgement, it's automatically dumped. Is this a logical conclusion?  fit in everywhere in my teens, it didn't matter. I'm not exaggerating either, everyone just accepted me for being the ""eccentric/weird smart kid"". But as far as I can tell, I was never bullied or picked on. I was just ""there"" and nobody minded what so ever. This seems in contrast to many people on the spectrum though? don't remember learning to read or write, because I knew how before the age of 5 and most people's brains can't store long term memories before the age of 5 (although some outlier exceptions do exist)  few of my active hobbies include but are not limited to: Programming, LEGOs, gaming, drone flying, robotics, photography, 3d printing, graphics design, game development (my job actually), investing (my other job), psychology (have an associates!), retro game collecting, smart home technology. loved making geometric and fractal patterns by hand as a kid, as well as arranging and sorting things like pennies. I also had a habit of ""building things"" out of my books, baseball/marvel cards, etc. I would be more interested in making a card castle out of my baseball cards than actually looking at the card, if that makes sense. swear people don't know how the world ""really works"". The world seems much more mechanical, functional, structured, to me than others seem to look at it. Humans also seem wildly predictable, and I scare people a lot with this ""skill"" sometimes by accident. I can't think of any solid examples, but this happens constantly in my life. have more in common with ""Alternative culture"" groups than anyone else, no matter the group even. I'm just generally more aligned.  been told I am a sociopath by a few people because of my ability to calmly ""figure out"" a crisis or emergency situation. I just switch off and ""do whats needed"". (9b?) guard once pointed a charged, loaded M16 at my head. (Remember, I used to work on the flightine). I openly laughed at him and called him an idiot, because of how ridiculous the situation was.  The story is too long to go into, but basically he was just being a moron hot head airman who wasn't ready to be armed. of all video games I play need to be ""constructive"" somehow. What I mean by that isn't that they need to be like Minecraft. It's more so, they have to have a goal, a finale, a ""purpose"". example, I love XCOM, Civ 6, Diablo 1 and 2, tarcraft, Minecraft, or heavily story driven games like Uncharted, Horizon, DooM 2016/Eternal, etc. But I can't find joy in ""pointlessly directionless"" games that once you're done, you've made no real tangible progress. For example, Halo, Call of Duty, Among Us, mash Bros (Exception to all these: Unless with friends), or just about any online competitive game thats just ""Do a match, win the thing, do another match, win the thing."". They don't feel like they have purpose, it feels like once you're done, you've accomplished nothing. I need progress, even if it's just continuing to the next chapter of a story. I don't like games that are ""fun for fun's sake"", does that make sense? I am aware games like CoD have rank-ups, leaderboard, unlocks and stuff, but to me, it all doesn't feel like actual ""constructive"" progress.) is it so damned hard for regular people to even relate to people one state/province over? I can talk to anyone in the world with fair ease, yet normal people seem very unable to break out of their personal social net/rules/structure. I oddly don't have that problem. But I have Asperger's. houldn't I have that problem? I have a theory that us high functioning type might be trying so extra-extra-extra hard to fit in, we go from ""Unable"" to ""exceptional super power"" through sheer will of force.

I'm trying to say, is that I've never realized that all the times I was called a dumb for not realising something obvious, is because I've partially 'blind' aka having issues processing visual info. But at the same time, I never connected my particular ear sensitivity, to the fact that it was a way of compensating my lack of vision, literally speaking.  and particular skin sensitivity, all points out that it was a way to compensate. 27 years later, and I've realized that I'm not dumb, but how can you blame a partially 'blind' man of not being able to see, right in front of him?Just a thought on being 'dumb'",1634410563,1075,196

According to the very wonderful doctor who administered the test, when I asked, ""I know you can't give me an official diagnoses until you review everything, but is this all going the way I was expecting it to?"" and she had a big happy smile replied ""Yes, I certainly think so"" in a pleasant tone.  I take that as confirmation, so I'm running with it for now. If it turns out I do not have Asperger's, that's fine too, I will accept either conclusion.

We were just in sync. I don't mean like we were instant buddies, some of these people I had nothing in common with and no interest in any kind of friendship, but there's something about them, they just.. work in my head, they make sense, I know how their brains work. to ask the question; this happen to anyone else?*37, just discovered I have Asperger's, and now I have a nagging social question.",1634350652,2587,467

A sort of impostor syndrome (lack of genuine belief in your own achievements), but with Asperger's case.I have been diagnosed in sixth grade and since then I have been on a regular therapy. It's going really well, my psychologist is nice and talking with him about things really helps, but I can't shake off the feeling it's all sort of forced - here's why:My A is mild, as said the doctor. It's not as intense as many cases and many people tell me they wouldn't realize if I haven't told them (one smarty even said he genuinely doesn't believe I have it and said someone must've been wrong, tch), and even myself I sometimes forget I have it, my life and communicating usually works well, I believe. That's the point, while I am diagnosed and actually notice how A affects me from time to time, I can't stop thinking that I'm subconsciously exaggerating or misinterpreting some things about myself. My therapy sessions are usually just talking about his my recent life is going and how to deal with minor problems like trouble with learning or harder relationship management, there are often times when we finish earlier because after talking about a thing or two I just go ""there's nothing more than that currently, my life's going fine"". Rationally thinking, that's how it probably should go and I should feel good about doing good despite the syndrome, but always when I read or hear about other people with A, it all feels so distant to me, despite the fact it should be quite opposite. And, once again rationally thinking, all aspies are different and the fact that I have less trouble with eye contact, maintaining small talk or have milder sensory troubles is not only making my A less valid, but also showing an effect of years of genuinely trying to live working social life. Yet again, this is a feeling I can't shake off. Did anyone have a similar problem? How to deal with it?

I shake and just sit there while the verbal insults come at me. The last time he raged at me was before he had an interview.

I walked out of the room. He followed me and absolutely lost it. Asking me why I did that, poking me, calling me names. I kept apologizing but it had no effect.

aspergers,"Hello everyone,   (26M) recently god diagnosed with AD. All my life, I was feeling a bit off, people even called me weird and I never understood why. I read about asperger some years ago and I was not sure I was fitting in and was thinking that maybe, I could have been faking it and it was certainly all in my head.   was not that good at school when I was young (I was not that interested in school and didn't know what it really meant). The day my professor told my father I would do nothing in my life, was the day it clicked in my head (I was furious but did not show it). It was like I put myself on a super sayian mode. I begun to learn programing in my free-time (all my week-end) at 13 years old, begun to do good marks at school and was happy with what I could achieve at that time, before I fall in depression at 18 years old, and I am not sure I really get out of it from that time.  Recently, after finishing my studies, I had time to rest but I was feeling tired constantly, my wood was swinging so I went to see my GP who sent my to a psychiatrist. I did a lot of session, because I had so much comorbidities, that it was not easy to tell what I really had (I am pretty sure my psychiatrist thought I was faking it all). o, they tested me with a bunch of tests like MRI, personality and projection test, along with Wechsler Test (IQ), which I scored below average (they didn't even tell me what was my IQ, but I know it's below average because the day I did the test, I was tired, couldn't concentrate, and I was having difficulties finding words, and even struggled doing simple things. When they gave the results, they said I was self-sabotaging, which could be true, but was not my intention). finally got diagnosed with AD, anxiety, depression, and have symptoms of ADD. After my IQ test, I found out that I had severe sleep apnea too, which is certainly going for years (at least 3 years) but I didn't notice it because I had to get early to go to school, and thought that's the reason I was so tired. had glaucoma on both eyes recently, which is unusual for my age. the things I was complaining about, finally had an explanation, and from that day, my psychiatrist was taking me more seriously and even said that the problem was not me, but doctors not trusting me, and I was more a zebra than a horse (if you don't know this reference, have a look at Theodore Woodward). All my life I was feeling a bit off. I was not caring at all in school at young age, begun to work when professor told my father I wasn't going to do anything in my life. Begun to do well at school, learnt programming in week-ends (13 years old) and was happy with what I could achieve. Fell in depression at 18, not sure I get out of it since that time. Recently diagnosed with AD + depression + anxiety + severe sleep apnea + glaucoma (unusual at that age). I wanted to know if any of you had so hard time making yourself taken seriously by medical people ?**  **Have you ever had your IQ tested, and how did you react to your result ?**  **Is an IQ test while having severe sleep apnea + depression relevant ?**  ""**R u ok ?""**   am sorry, english is not my first language, by the way this took me so much time writing/rereading.Low IQ",1634330018,3231,626

aspergers,"As a child, I was extremely quiet and shy at school. It was really bad, sometimes I wouldn't even answer a direct question. I had very few friends and was bullied a lot. my parents went to a parent teacher conference with my kindergarten teacher, she said she was waiting for me to come out of my shell and be less quiet. My parents were shocked and told the teacher she must have gotten the wrong child because I wasn't quiet at all. home, and around people I knew well, I was loud and even very obnoxious. I suppose this is my real personality. I also spent a lot of time on the internet from a young age, where I was very outgoing. I don't know why I was so shy in public. I'm still shy, but I've worked hard to overcome my social anxiety. Even in college, I had to force myself to eat lunch with other people. It was torture, I was so terrified. I don't know why I'm like this, I've always had very little confidence.  I'm in my 30s and it's a lot easier for me to socialize. I can go out and talk to new people like a functional human being. However I still suffer anxiety. was diagnosed with ADHD and PDD-NO as a child. I wasn't diagnosed with aspergers but from lurking on this subreddit I feel I often relate to the issues here more than I relate to a lot of ADHD subs.

When I was with my therapist yesterday (anxiety-related issues), I joked that some of my social faux-pas were part of my Asperger's (I've never been diagnosed and terribly sorry if that joke offends anyone) and she replied ""well Asperger's has crossed my mind before"".  Asperger's can explain a few things but based on multiple online tests I've done since then, all have said I do not meet the criteria.  a little background on me I'm a 32 year old male, I'm pretty sociable though I keep my close circle to just a few people, I have best friends, I'm not particularly fixated on any particular niche (I'd say I know a little bit of a lot of things), I'm athletic, I can read facial cues and body language well, I'm a self-described ""introverted extrovert"" (meaning that while I do value my alone time, when I'm in social situations I can be outgoing), I have little difficulty understanding the emotions someone might feel (for example, I feel second hand embarrassment), when I'm learning something new, however, I prefer to have structure until I get comfortable enough that I can start ""winging it"", I'm told I'm a good listener and my father has told me on several occasions how envious of me he is by my ability to make small talk.  problem I seem to have in my life is for some reason, either by my own doing or the other person's disinterest, I have difficulty forming romantic relationships (32 years old, been intimate with many women, can comfortably talk to them, go on dates, but never had a girlfriend). My therapist believes that might be because I tend to get too logical in conflict as opposed to empathizing.  anyone weigh in on this?Is it possible to simply have ASD traits without a full-blown Asperger's diagnosis?",1634318410,1768,310

aspergers,"I (23F) first suspected AD around 10 years ago. My father most likely has it, his brother is diagnosed. My maternal cousin is also on the spectrum, so it kinda runs in the family. always been quite rigid. And quite mentally ill. I haven't been suspecting AD for a couple of years, but I started dating a guy almost two months ago and have been feeling ... free. I feel like I can finally, *finally*, be myself. I haven't felt that way in ... forever, I suppose. This is a new feeling. Before, I have always tried to emulate the behaviors of others. I'm still doing it, of course, just not with him. I have tried to suppress parts of me that I feel aren't ""socially accepted"". At times, it's even gotten to the point where I have condemned the fact that I exist in other people's memories. I am a perfectionist and I have had a hard time accepting that I cannot control what other people think of me. But since a completely secluded life hasn't been attainable, I have had to resort to the strategy of mirroring others. I'd say I'm even doing it with the guy I'm seeing. I'm taking on his dialect. I'm taking on his interests. The thing, though, is that they're ***my interests***. I'm not mirroring his interests, I'm ***reclaiming my own***. With him, I don't pretend to have interests for the sake of being accepted. For the first time, being myself doesn't feel wrong. I don't even know myself, because I've *never* allowed myself to be myself. think I've always had an innate feeling of strangeness, causing me to seek out behaviors considered ""normal"" by the vast majority. I'm only wearing black/dark clothes, too, because it's the only color I find comfortable to dress in. thing is, I've always thought that I'm coping quite well and that I couldn't possibly be on the spectrum with such few issues. Lately, however, I've realised why. I recently moved to a new city and have been meeting lots of new people. I've now realised that perhaps the reason why I've been able to cope is because *I have been quite isolated from others*. In the past years, I've had *one* friend. It's weighed me down, because it further reinforces the feeling that there's oMeThInG WrOnG WiTh mE ugh. But it's kept me isolated from lots of stimuli. I don't know how others cope with their packed days. in the second paragraph, I claimed that I haven't had issues. The truth is that I haven't exactly been issue-free in my life. I've been diagnosed with lots of different things throughout the years - health anxiety, depression, social anxiety, body dysmorphic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder ... eeetc. runs in the family (dad, dad's brother, a maternal cousin). It wouldn't be so shocking. But I'm not sure. I think I'm gonna go into therapy, not with the intention of seeking out a diagnosis, but in an attempt to get to know myself better. of love to allI am beginning to suspect ASD again",1634315389,2885,514

Personally speaking there’s two characters in two animated shows I’m watching currently that I definitely do think have either autism or are on the spectrum in general. The first being Marcy from the show Amphibia she personally has displayed behavioral traits of both someone with autism and ADHD as she’s very smart and a logic based thinker, but she’s also extremely energetic and emotional at points which are signs that people with ADHD seem to have based on what I’ve studied. Plus she seems to struggle with eye contact which I also have struggled with when having conversations along with her being a talker which I can personally relate too. second character who I think is also on the spectrum is Luz from The Owl House I’ve heard many say she could have ADHD which I definitely think is very plausible. Considering she does display lots of behavioral traits that people with ADHD have such as being very energetic and have trouble with some social cues. Although she’s also very weird (in a good way) so I can’t feel if she’s just being weird or if it’s her ADHD that plays a large role in her personality causing others to think she’s weird.

Mainly mom was the one who cooked and cleaned. know after 36 years on this planet, what I can do, what I can’t do, what I am capable of, what I enjoy doing and what is impossible. I also, as I said earlier, know established roles.

Yet she still gets my dad and I to clean after whoever cooked, and criticises our cleaning methods, because she isn’t doing it, she delegated it to us, and is upset because we do it our way, not her way (then why offer it in the first fucking place?)  she brings up that I don’t cook, I feel like it is a form of gaslighting cause every response is “do you think I enjoy cooking?” You fucking asked me why I don’t cook, I gave you an answer, and you made it all about you!!!  have a hard enough times trying to get her to understand that I AM FUCKING 36!!, I AM TRYING TO BE INDEPENDENT, WE ARE IN LOCKDOWN AND I NEED OME REEMBLANCE OF A FUCKING ROUTINE, THE PONGE I DRY!!!THI I IT, THI I ME!!!, the phrase (can’t teach a old dog new tricks comes to mind) or why people say things like I don’t want to to adult today or Adulting is hard, yeah because school had 12 years to teach us vital life skills, and fucking didn’t do it did they, I don’t remember a class that was about paying taxes, getting a high paying job or social skills, (I remember failing math and barely passing my exams) I could completely understand if those courses existed and for whatever reason I chose not to attend or I was taking a whizz, but they were not this is me fucking accept it. the end of the day I am just trying to live a life somewhere between a Hikikomori lifestyle and Jokers quote “the worst part about having a mental illness is people expect you to behave as if you don’t” the woman who wanted me diagnosed in the first place, never accepts me blaming anything on my Autism as an excuse, and it drives me up the fucking wall, I am running out of patience and fucks and proper verbiage to tell her “this makes me uncomfortable, I don’t enjoy it, it has nothing to do with how you feel, please make dinner tonight and leave me the fuck alone” I don’t know how to go on from here without having feelings of pure hatred for her,  not all the time but sometimes.  desperately hope I am not the only Aspie who has thoughts like this.

I figured since many of you also deal with executive disorder and a memory that's all over the place, someone here might have just what I need. my issue is that my brain only saves information contextually, so I often forget about tasks until something else reminds me of them and then I often put them off due to executive dysfunction or because I have something else to do in that moment. I've gotten pretty good at using my calendar to remind me of time bound tasks but the ones that don't have a deadline are the ones that trip me up. o basically what I want is an app (ideally something I can use both on PC and my android phone) where I can add tasks as soon as I think of them, prioritize them and have them presented to me in a neat, orderly fashion so whenever I have some free time and energy at my hands I don't end up just sitting on idle pointlessly because I can't think of anything to do. Ideally I'd be able to add a deadline to a task if I want to, set reminders at certain points before the deadline approaches and have a calendar tied in for time bound tasks/appointments so I have all in one place. you know anything along those lines (or maybe a little different but something easy to organize that works well for you), I'd be thankful for suggestions and descriptions!Looking for apps/tools that help me with organizing my life",1634296620,1465,274

aspergers,"I'm at the high end of the spectrum. Before DM-V, it would have been Aspergers, but now it's officially PDD-NO. I work full time, and mostly manage to support myself. Most of the time I can deal with the noise going on around me, as long as it's just noise. But when I really need to work quickly and efficiently, I find it's easier to focus while wearing headphones to block out aural distractions. My immediate boss hates it when I wear headphones; he says it's a ""safety issue"", but won't say *what* the safety issue is. It seems like what makes him angry is that he has to come into my field of view to get my attention rather than yelling across the shop floor.  days ago he threatened to write me up. I wrote an email to him and my boss' boss (the company owner) letting them know I was on the spectrum, and that headphones are how I deal with poor executive function and emotional self-regulation. The owner reiterated that it was a safety issue--but did not say what the safety issue was--and said he was okay with *one* headphone. me, it's obvious that one headphone increases the background noise by introducing more layers, rather than blocking noise *out*. I know that wearing sound isolating or sound cancelling headphones is a common accommodation for people on the spectrum (under the Americans with Disabilities Act), *when it doesn't interfere with performing your job duties*. I also know that, given that I'm currently performing 2 discrete job functions, replacing me in a short enough time period to avoid blowing hard deadlines and losing big clients would be both very challenging, and very expensive, if it was possible. If I quit on the spot, it's entirely possible that it would end up tanking the company, since about half of all of the company's business passes directly through my position. **BUT** I don't have another job lined up right now, so walking out would be a severe financial hardship. **can** function without headphones. But I have a harder time focusing, I get progressively more frustrated and upset as the day goes on, and it generally makes me hate my job. (On the very rare occasions where I'm the only person in the building, I feel no need to wear headphones.) This is the only place I've worked where I've had to ask for any kind of accommodation, and I'm worried that if I push back, then I'll get my way *but* that will be the impetus for them to find someone to replace me, so they can fire me. the question is, is this a hill to die on?  that makes sense.Are headphones a hill to die on?",1634257079,2541,457

aspergers,"Hi, all. so here goes. a 23 year-old man with Asperger's yndrome, and I've been experimenting with my sexuality since being 18, having had no prior contact in any way. Initially, after my first sexual encounter, I explored 'sexting' through the 'kinky' communities on theAmino app, through 'role-playing' with young adults like myself. watched the tamest pornography from the age of 13 1/2 onwards till being 23, yet always had moral issues with it - I'd never fail to get emotional over recognising the humanity of the women and men in these videos - "".....This is somebody's daughter/son!"", is how I'd think, even though everybody was a consenting adult.  feel irrationally guilty every time I watched a clip, feeling as though I wasn't a 'real feminist'. This would lead me to clean obsessively around me, to feel better. is tied into - and emblematic of - my lifelong OCD, and specifically, the pure-'O' that I've experienced since mid-2019 - I'd see only moral absolutes, no nuance.  in my later teens/early twenties, I went on a few dates and enjoyed the company of the women I'd been with, yet consistently felt as if I'd prefer just being their friend, as a new friend was really what I was searching for, having not made one since the end of high-school (aged 16, in 2014). due to my special interests being somewhat obscure, I always found myself having no kinship with my peers, and so I found it hard to sustain even an acquaintanceship.  was in spite of me trying as much as possible to ingratiate myself into the interests of my peers, so as to better understand them. later made a new friend in 2019 who lives close to me, and formally abandoned dating apps then. on, after an online relationship that failed due to a lack of emotional reciprocity, I began to feel what little semblance of a labido I once had fail, to the point where I felt no longer sexually attracted to anybody. Now, I'm pretty certain that I'm asexual. conveniently fits in with my life-plans of not having children or a long-term relationship (both of which seem very stressful). of this said, I've been endlessly ruminating on what constitutes sexual harrassment since the 17th June 2021, after being mentally reminded of awkward attempts at flirting that I'd participated in. then, I've read so much about MeToo &amp; Time's Up (as I have done since 2017), made a list of sexual misconduct behaviours to 'check-off', and looked at a dozen + forums online about sexual harrassment. instance I'm worried about specifically is a time in the summer of 2020 (before I realised that I was asexual), where I found a woman's blog on Tumblr who had been asked sexual questions by men, and had responded somewhat positively.  thought, ""Maybe she'll respond to me, if I send a question!"", and because I wasn't as confident as the other men, I asked a three-letter double entendre/innuendo, followed by a question mark. I was trying to mirror the confident sexuality that women have shown me in person and online.  lady recently said to me on Reddit that it was the equivalent of making an awkward attempt at flirting in a bar/tavern, and as long as I backed off immediately whenever I noticed their lack of interest (as I did here, and have done prior, always), then it's not harrassment. she's correct, in the sense that in a real-life situation, elements that were absent on the Internet would be present, such as prosody/intonation, body language, facial expressions, etc.  reply made me feel a bit better, but I still feel like a bad person who is akin to Harvey Weinstein or Bill Cosby.  feel awful that might have hurt a lady, but I also wonder if this is just my OCD 'making a mountain out of a molehill'. I'm not trying to gain help on courtship, since after this long journey of self-discovery, I've unsurprisingly realised that I'm not at all 'kinky' or interested in sexual relations or romantic relationships etc.  just like to reflect on my past actions and be able to walk into the future with a clear conscience, so I can still call myself a feminist and be an ally to women and a good human being. mother agreed with my suggestion I have an 'overactive conscience' (a line from Frasier), so I don't know if I'm just worrying about literally nothing, or if I'm a dreadful human.  don't want to kill myself, but I feel compelled to if I'm a terrible harrasser.I believe that I've sexually harrassed someone, and can't live with the guilt or shame; therefore, I'm going to run away from home and kill myself.",1634239714,4500,787

Now she’s thrown fits like that before (there usually about a door not being opened) but they were not as bad as this one she had in Monday, this tantrum she threw went on for hours and she screamed and cried to the top of her lungs and the staff were not doing anything to calm her down or discipline her for throwing a tantrum which kinda pissed me off as they didn’t at all seem to care about what was going on or how her tantrums were effecting other students there on the spectrum mentally or emotionally. felt so overwhelmed I cried a bit and asked to take several breaks in other rooms because her tantrum was just that hard on me and very loud.

I was in the vicinity of her doing this, and I didn't expect her to do that The first few bangs had already affected me intent - Deliberately trying to trigger me badly. Why would she smash the bucket again if it's already closed and we know this because it appears to be closed? If she is making sure it is closed, why not do that every time it ""appears"" to be closed? Why would you do it that once in that specific occasion?Do I suck at reading intent?",1634228851,1014,196

aspergers,"o, I've been having a crush (or at least I think) on a classmate for a while now. And about a year ago she started working where I work. We talk at school here and there and at work during break if we share it. Not only do I find her kinda cute, I also love her personality, and we share similar interests.  want to go further with this. he is defenently special to me, I just don't really know exactly what I feel. But here is my problem. A potato probably have better social skills than me. I don't know anything about how it comes to starting/maintaining/ending a conversation. I can struggle to talk to others, espcially asking questions, To the point where I'll stay in a very unhealthy position just because I don't want to bother/ask someone for help.

I struggle putting my thoughts into words (o much that it took me a few hours to write this post). And, again the only thing I know how to do would just be straight foward and say that she is special to me and that I like her. But I know for a fact that poeple don't like that (learned it the hard way). what confuses me is that I think she might have some form of interest in me ? I was playing A Dance of Fire and Ice (I'll refer to it by it's acronym, ADOFAI, from on) in media art class. he sits at the desk behind me and came over to check what I was doing and what the game was. Does she have interest in me, if only a little ? a few weeks ago I did asked if she would be interested to go eat at a small local restarant we have in our neighbourhood. he said that she was working on the day I asked, and that she was planing on hangning out with her friends for most of the week. but that if she's free for it next week she'll tell me. sorry this post is a mess and not at all in order, but do any of you have any advice ?

aspergers,"I was diagnosed during the summer of 2006 after one of my teachers noticed I preferred focusing on certain subjects and activities with zero interaction with other children.  Throughout my childhood I've had multiple people, nurses, doctors, teachers, other students, family tell me how I know so much.  There were multiple occasions where teachers didn't even know the stuff I know.  However I have behavior that is comparable to a ten year old; Innocent, curious, immature but not as immature as a pubescent teen.  Because the way I outwardly behaved I was seen as unruly, stupid, unacceptable despite I was just freely expressing myself.  Lack of social filter and poor communication.  I became the gifted child growing up to be a burnt out depressed adult meme. the way I was treated, how I was seen, I became fearful, more secluded, lonely.  My high school's autism group promoting Autism peaks didn't help either.  That group made me feel like having autism is wrong or it's a disease needing to be cured, like I shouldn't exist.  That group was literally trying to teach the autism out of me, saying my behavior needs to conform to society, my hobbies I hyper-fixate on were said to displease other people so I shouldn't being them up.  I was taught stimming was bad as it was distracting/bothering others and I shouldn't do it.  I was taught memes were bad and shouldn't watch them despite they bring humor and some happiness into my life.  I was being conformed to a stupid tight box and not allowed to be myself despite who I am was not harming anyone.  I no longer felt human and I felt like I didn't belong anywhere.  I felt like I had to conform to the strange social norms of society.  I hated it. until recently is when I gave up on social norms and don't care how people see me.  crew what other people think about me.  I'm not harming them so their ideas of me are invalid.  My behavior has greatly changed, or rather I now express myself as I truly am, especially after second puberty.  I stim freely, wear eccentric clothing including a collar, got various tattoos and piercings, and screw gender norms!  For me wearing a collar actually works as an excellent coping mechanism for feeling subhuman.  I also found a job in IT that accepts me the way I am.  I go to events with other neurodivergent people I can relate to.  Almost everything is going better now.  The last thing I need to do is make some friends which is a recurring problem I have.  I communicate with people for a few months then the communication rapidly grows silent afterwards.  Loneliness is the last thing making me unhappy but I can solve that eventually too. I have the behavior of a child or dog freely exploring life, the brains of a college graduate, and with the amount of B I had to put up with from society I have the soul of someone in their midlife.

aspergers,"Hey! I am 14 and in 8th grade. Because of my disability, Mom made the wise decision to homeschool me after seeing my performance in Kindergarten (not well.) I partially re-entered school in 7th grade, doing some classes online and other ones in person. One thing I did develop over my time as a homeschooler was a passion for learning and understanding everything that related to my experience as a human in a complex universe. my 1 1/2 years in school, I have not been able to garner anything past cordial relationships with other students. This did not exactly surprise me, as I had traditionally been quite solitary and thoughtful. One thing I did notice though was how much my web of teachers and related adults within the school were supporting me and accommodating my needs within class. Not just that, often I found myself chatting after class with these teachers about our experiences with a subject, and interesting factual information we happen to know. One notable time over lunch break I had a 10 minute conversation with my science teacher (7th) discussing evolutionary taxonomy of all things. sure what else to say, except I wonder if any of you have been feeling the same way over your time in school or related activities.Does anyone else associate themselves with teachers than with other students?",1634167716,1315,224

aspergers,"The question ""When I'm reading a story, I find it difficult to work out the characters' intentions."" on the AQ-10 test, Is incredibly confusing for me. do not read at all, because most of the time I am dealing with anxiety/fatigue to the point where I cannot think, and doing mindless activities best suits me. When I am absolutely stable, I can read a lot and find myself doing it for a long time.  I then think about this question in other contexts, maybe movies or real life.  the following questions I have about the referenced question torture me, could I ever possibly know or figure out someone's intent unless it is explicitly stated? Is this what the referenced question is asking? Well, of course I know what the person's intent is if they say they are going to the store.  of my past trauma I spend a long time figuring out if someone is out to get me. Apparently I am way off when I end up discussing these worries of mine with other people and they clarify their intent. example of this is when I believed my coworkers were bullying me, this triggered a chain of suspiscions from me. I told my coworker that loud noises affect me because of my PTD two weeks prior to this event We have a cytotoxic bin at work that requires being smashed by a rubber mallet in order to close it The nurses will usually do this to ensure it's closed It makes a very loud sound My coworker used the rubber mallet after the bucket was already closed (bucket showed no signs of being still open) he told me she wanted to, ""make sure it was closed"". I was in the vicinity of her doing this, and I didn't expect her to do that The first few bangs had already affected me intent - Deliberately trying to trigger me badly. Why would she smash the bucket again if it's already closed and we know this because it appears to be closed? If she is making sure it is closed, why not do that every time it ""appears"" to be closed? Why would you do it that once in that specific occasion?  used similar reasoning processes to this when working out the other oddities I noticed in that day with her throughout my shift. It didn't help that beforehand my boss told me they are manipulative and cause trouble, which I found unprofessional of her. It put me on the alert.  am diagnosed with C-PTD as well.  am not sure if these thoughts are mainly related to that. summarize, these questions are highly difficult for me to answer, but I will spend hours trying to figure them out, and google passages of texts in order to ask myself if I can figure out ""intent"". Again, that seems an odd thing to ask of me. I'm not telepathic. Do neurotypicals usually understand the most likely intent? Is that the key difference here?  do they do that? I find myself analyzing the ""crime scene"" in order to find patterns. I thought my co-worker spilt water on the ground for me to think was pee, as it was reported to me as such. o I ended up trying to figure out the splash patterns of the pee to figure out if that was a spill or a result of someone getting to the toilet.Questions for diagnosing Autism are vague",1634155099,3076,575

I knew it wouldn't lead to anything because 1. I was masking HARD to keep him around and wasn't showing my real personality AT ALL, which is unhealthy 2. I didn't actually like him, I thought he was annoying but still had feelings for him which would eventually go away I'm sure and 3. It was a bisexual guy whose primary relationship was with a woman lol. We only saw each other for around a month but the affection he gave was... unprecedented for me, to say the least. I actually enjoyed going on dates with him and spending time together, which hadn't really happened for me before with anyone else. We met about 10 times in total and by the third meeting I was crying in my bed at night thinking about how I couldn't be in a relationship with him and how it was unfair. Really, really unhealthy stuff. I cut contact with him because it would obviously just end up in hurt for me even if it did go further (which it probably wouldn't). clearly had a huge crush on him which made me confused as hell and now I feel just as miserable as everyone else who can't get a partner. I can't be under someone's thumb like that... I probably could continue our ""relationship"" but I would be very sad and pathetic in doing so, and again it would just end up hurting me in the end. It's illogical and I never should have engaged with this person in the first place. the resulting sadness feels overwhelming. I feel so insecure now. Prior to a few months ago, I didn't have any friends, and was fine with that. I liked being by myself constantly and never got lonely. But now I've been trying to make new friends because of the loneliness and have been successful to an extent, but there is so much insecurity... recently if they don't respond to me fast enough, I feel like when they do respond, it's because they feel bad for me or something, and I'm too boring to be around or be actual friends with anyone, despite me not caring at all before and actually saying that I prefer not to talk all the time (which is true lol). I don't think that's logical, I think it's because my self-esteem has plummeted as a result of this situation. not really sure what to do now. Do I start working on myself to attempt to increase the number of people who would accept me (I think they exist, there are just very few of them, and probably none where I live) or do I somehow try to trick myself into thinking I'm aromantic again and don't need friends?

Luckily I was able to survive financially in a few different ways while trying to do what I thought was best. I practiced stopping myself from criticising others, making fun, thinking and saying that people are stupid or idiots. I value being good above being intelligent or even being right. I'm in debt, I've been through depression and anxiety a lot in the last couple of years and I feel I'm mostly over it. I'm starting to slowly motivate myself to do things again, which is very hard. (I'm sure I have undiagnosed adhd). been finding that the motivation and slight increase in confidence is coming with frustration, a lack of patience, even a lack of calm. I feel I can be annoyed by almost anything. When I see people saying incorrect things online for example I can barely help but to call them out, but not just in an objective way, but not being nice about it anymore. It's like I've shifted my anxiety and self-hate to a more general anger or hate. usually wouldn't admit it, but I always feel superior to most people in some ways, then in other ways I feel like an idiot, and this isn't really a balance in my head. Objectively I can accept that I'm better at some things and other people are better at other things, but I can't help but be reactive. I feel like I'm a dick, or a grumpy old man. I'm 32, I only found out about aspergers at 32 so that may have shifted how I feel about myself. felt good meeting people somewhat like me, because I felt like an alien all my life, but in many ways there are things that I struggle with that I didn't know were linked to aspergers. There were things I thought applied to everyone, I thought nobody liked eye contact for example and that TV conversations were unrealistic for staring straight into eachother eyes as they talk. Clearly I didn't pay attention to conversations around me, as I wasn't looking. This is just an example. There's a fine line between feeling good from accepting who I am and we'll.. feeling bad about who I am. It's very hard to avoid seeing myself as disabled even though I don't really stim or have sensory sensitivities. guess a whole lot of these things combined has led me here, to this state of mind. But I don't like it, I don't want to be negative, mean, horrible.. I used to be better. I prefer who I used to be. I think of myself I get an image, and that image hasn't changed for years even though my face has changed in the mirror. I accept its my face but it doesn't feel like me, my internal self image is different. I forget what I look like and retain an internal self image all day until I see a mirror and even then I only notice the differences if I pay attention. stopped asking my parents for things I wanted when I was about 8. I realised my parents didn't have much money but my siblings kept ""I want, I want"" and getting what they wanted as my parents struggled more, so I went with even less, I said nothing, I was silent, for days sometimes. I sustained myself this whole time, until now. Now I have these depts and physical health issues. Everything bad seemed to come at once.

Because the tests I saw from the therapist was about my attention and focus meanwhile the asperger one was about my thoughts and my empathy n that sort of crap. A little context to why I believe I wasn't evaluated properly. The guy who did my test was gonna move job very soon and my case took longer than usual. o I feel like he was pressured to figure out if I had aaperger and nothing else.

And we are getting nothing but old old patients with respiratory problems. My job has literally become hand out tablets, check oxygen levels, tell old Mrs mith to get back into bed, and zipping people up in body bags. Relatives shouting at me all the time, down the phone. Tonight one of my patients died, and they had barely been out the room half an hour and hospital management sent another patient up.  is not the correct word here, but I'm not sure what is. It's like I'm suddenly being hit with all the things I hate about nursing and none of the bits I enjoy.

They work within a counseling clinic that is really on top of current research and is really professional overall.  our last session, I told her that my financial situation has degraded and that I can’t see her on a regular basis for awhile or get formally tested there in the near future like we had been discussing.  told me that until I can get formally tested there, that I should probably start viewing my life through the lens of being autistic. he said it would be helpful until I can confirm with them through formal testing. he said that I could learn a lot about why I have issues with communication, sensory sensitivity and change.  very confidant I’m autistic now, but I’m having trouble coming to terms with it. Apparently I’ve unconsciously learned to mask really well throughout my life as no one has suspected autism, even multiple psychologists, until my current therapist.   been clinically diagnosed with what feels like the entire DM-5, but the only one we are sure of me having is ADHD and this potential future autism diagnosis. this though, I’ve been relatively high achieving socially and academically, but that has come as a huge cost. I’ve burnt out severely around 3 times resulting in a suicide attempt, substance abuse and a psychotic break. I’ve had wonderful relationships with a couple of people that I truly loved and that accepted me for who I am. The best one was years ago, it was around a year and half and we met when we both lived in the dorms at college. I truly loved her and she loved me, but I couldn’t handle the lack of alone time and constant stimulation so I had to leave.  really having difficulty coming to terms with the fact that most of my difficulties in life were do to me being autistic without knowing. o much suffering and lost joy.

aspergers,"Hey all, found this sub while just on a browsing whim.   I was diagnosed with Asperger's back in 1999.  I've had depression with very low self-esteem for a few years before that.  The diagnosis didn't help. say I have had a difficult life would be putting it mildly.  I find myself judged because of how I talk, or how I always sit by myself.  Neither by choice, just the way things turned out for me.  If I ever tried talking they'd make a face or insult me. I never formed any relationships because of that.  I figure they don't want me around, so I stayed away. the years, I have become too afraid to even approach someone let alone say 'Hello' to them.   had a crush on the same woman for 27 years now, for example.  I doubt I'll ever ask her out, I imagine she must think I'm dumb or worse.) *do* have friends who knew me from way back.  One whom was pretty much family, our moms were best friends and we often shared a crib together.  Another friend, who is the only one I know who has *never* had trouble understanding what I was saying or asked me to repeat myself, even back before I got my cleft palate fixed, which improved my speech by 90%.  Both are female, and while very different from each other (One is more ""mature-minded"", the other is a Gamer like me.) they may be the only people in my life that *really* know me.  Funnily enough, they have never met each other. dad was mentally and emotionally abusive to my mom and I.  He gaslighted us, and conditioned us.  And whenever things didn't go his way he'd have a terrible tantrum, during which we hid in our bedrooms to ""wait out the storm"" as we called it.  Like how you'd go to the basement when a tornado came through your area. dad was also a hoarder, my bedroom became my true home.  I fell in with the Gamer lifestyle at a very young age.  When mom bought me the original Nintendo, I was pretty much destined to be the best Gamer ever :)  I started collecting retro games and consoles recently.  mom passed away in 2018 after catching a rare blood infection that knocked out both her kidneys and left her bed-ridden.  he didn't want to live like that.  Dad lost his mind and had to be taken to an adult care facility, where he remained until his death 2 years later, on the exact same date.    I've been on my own since then. kept me very sheltered my whole life, so most of what I know, cooking, cleaning, home repairs, were self taught, again, from a young age.  I now truly believe she needed me at her side because she didn't want to be left alone with dad.  he and I had a good relationship, although I can look back now and see it was also not that helpful for me either.  I wanted to use the money my grandparents left for me to go away to college.  But mom said I couldn't take care of myself, so I agreed not to go.  he needed my dependence, so I gave it to her.  I depended on her love too, honestly, as like I said before, I only had two friends and we rarely saw each other in those days.  Mom and I were best buddies.  I do miss her. honestly don't know if I even belong here on this sub or not, I am very different from every Asperger person I ever met.  Maybe I'm just trying to find out if I'm really on the spectrum by meeting others that may be more like me?   very recently found out I was adopted (That is a WHOLE different sub, I'm sorry I don't want to talk about it here.), and my bio-mom was *super* into drugs during her pregnancy with me, so now I think that was also a factor in why I am like this.

We do things like going bowling in the movie theatre, sometimes with other clients etc. but lately we always meet at my apartment and stay there  He always talks long stories about himself, filling the time.   behavior is sometimes determinative, I need an opinion if this is okay or if he is going too far.  Examples are: When I can not hold an apointment or am sick I have to justifice for it.  I once wrote him I was sick and he still insisted on coming to my apartment.  The first time he came to my apartment he visisted in every room, opened doors, looking around, inspecting.  Todays he was here and looked in my drawers, in my fridige.  He did not let he in house, when we drove by and he had to get something out of it.  I had to wait outside.  Once when he saw my cigarettes on my table he held me a 15 min lecture about how bad smoking is,  the same again the next time he saw the cigarettes somewhere, it got so far that I have to hide stuff in my own home.

aspergers,"People ask me to give presentations frequently. I always say yes, even though I hate it, because I know it’s really one of the few effective ways to further my career. The problem is that I come off incredibly uneducated, because I have such a hard time translating thoughts to actual speech. Everything is garbled and comes out in the least eloquent way possible. This often means that other people get opportunities for which I am overqualified, but I always get refused because people think I am less experienced or don’t fully understand my areas of expertise. It is significantly holding me back. I thought carefully planning out my presentations would help, but it often just makes me blank more and entirely forget my material. Don’t get me started on answering peoples’ questions, which I do incredibly poorly, despite being able to respond properly in text form.

I'm used to people misinterpreting my facial expressions and body language and treating me poorly because of it. At my present job however, I've run into a new situation and it's bumming me out.  I'm a studio manager at a kind-of prestigious New York art studio, and there is a fashion brand here that's doing pretty well (they got invited to the Met Gala this year). One of the founders of the studio routinely calls me crazy when he's talking to people on the phone or when they have models around etc. I've done my best to be friendly, but that seems to be making it worse. They're kind of a prestige company to be renting studio space with us, so I don't have the option of confronting them directly really. Most of my work is maintenance stuff, so I'm usually just minding my own business and cleaning with a podcast in. being said, it's starting to bother me because I've had many run-ins with New York fashion people where they were generally ableist and rude.

aspergers," TLDR: Think I’m on the spectrum. RAAD-R score is 129. Therapist agrees. Psychiatrist is sure I’m not. have been apprehensive about posting here because I don’t want to come off as trying to self-diagnose, and that’s not what I’m trying to do. I understand it’s a long process and diagnosis has to come from specialists. I don’t want to invalidate anyone’s experience through this post, just looking for a sense of community and some possible clarity on the whole situation. some background, I’m 25F diagnosed Bipolar with psychosis. tarted looking into AD since we suspected my boyfriend to be on the spectrum, and found myself in the search. poured through as many articles (and some papers) as possible since the time we started looking into this. I could really relate to so many things that were described - both big and small. through some disbelief, relief, and so much sadness for all the times I was misunderstood as a child and an adult. I was honestly surprised to learn that the level of social anxiety I experience is not a common experience. I didn’t even realize how much I was hurting myself trying to fit in with other people. To put it lightly, it always felt uncomfortable but I thought that’s the norm so I kept doing it anyway. ince I became aware that this is not a universal experience, I stopped doing it and my life has gotten so much better. a quest for confirmation, both of us took the RAAD-R test with each other’s help for increased accuracy. He scored 115, and I scored 129. I also took it twice, once by myself, again to increase accuracy. The second time I scored 121, so I guess that’s in close range. Also went through all other tests in [aspietests.org]( except one. Most seemed to indicate being on the spectrum, but I’m not sure how some of the scores are interpreted. AQ test was negative though, I think I scored about 25. I also read this [article]( and I could relate to about 148/173, looking back from childhood. that, I talked to my therapist who I have been seeing regularly for some months now. he seemed to agree with what I suspected and asked me to start the process to get an official diagnosis since she doesn’t give one herself. an appointment with a psychiatrist nearby, this was my first time seeing her. Had two sessions with her. In the first one, she just said there’s no way I could be on the spectrum. he said I exhibit no signs of it and stated the fact that I could make eye contact as a definitive factor for not being on the spectrum? I told her that I’ve learnt how to do it now, but it was difficult as a child. It’s even difficult now during high anxiety or stressful situations, but maybe that's normal - not sure.  boyfriend jumped in to give her some more examples of how I tend to behave at times, and she reluctantly agreed to a second session. At the end of the second session, she told me I seem to have Asperger’s / Level 1 autism-like traits such as social anxiety, “meltdowns”, hyper-focus, special interests, stimming, high IQ but I can’t be on the spectrum. What does that even mean? emailed an AD-related organization for a second opinion, they are a little slow at responding but said they will give me an official evaluation. I don’t know if I should stop trying - not that I would do anything with the diagnosis except for finding some closure, and possibly a sense of community.  worried that I'm extrapolating too much or being a hypochondriac.

Maybe go to a shopping centre or restaurant just to have people around us, to accumulate our brain to normal humans moving around us. then, Elon Musk says, autism ""cure"" in 5 years. Yeah, his timelines are nuts, but hey. Let's say it's 10 years, 15, 20 until the cure. Maybe it's ""never"". have you considered the concept of a jigsaw puzzle? the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle didn't fit, would you attempt to jam them together? No, that would be stupid. evidence shows, that we are not INTERETED in socialising. evidence shows, we are not GOOD at socialising. evidence shows, this is BECAUE we fail to make the proper range of facial movements, incuding eye contact, but other more subtle body movements too. evidence shows, that the reason we can't make these facial movements, is because we failed to do so with our own mothers in the early months of baby development. autism itself seems to be because neurons in the brain that most kids lose as they get older, we keep these extra receptors, and thus, we have constant sensory overload. Like a computer with far too much data coming in, and we are being overwhelmed with it. point is this.... should people, in general, do things that they are bad at? should people stick to their strengths? you then consider, that socialising is a strain for us, then what happens when the difficulty of socialising increases? Then, the strain increases further still. we risk things like, overload, ""snapping"", not to sound stupid, but even, ""beating our wives"", ""getting arrested"", ""shouting"", ""domestic abuse"", etc. risk not just our own domestic abuse on others, but that others would do it to us. imagine in contrast, something that we are much more natural at, such as, writing at length, talking to ourselves at length, doing Math (some of us), computer programming, artwork, working repetitive jobs, alone time. in fact, why would you overload your system with something you are bad at? the equivalent of going to the gym, working out, and you can feel your muscles giving in, and yet you keep exercising, and then... pop! And you break a muscle, break a bone, etc. You have taken this beyond the ""breaking point"", and now you have ""snapped"". my current plan is to have no social life, until the autism cure comes. the way, Neuralink from Elon Musk. He says this will be like a laser eye surgery procedure, that takes minutes. it takes minutes to CURE autism, it will take minutes to CAUE autism. we can be given autism before work, to make us more productive at work, with hyper-focus. perhaps then, we can have autism taken away, when we get home in the evenings, so that we are better husbands, fathers, friends, social life etc. would be like ""autism on-demand"".Should we wait until the ""autism cure"" to attempt a social life?",1634014616,2882,502
aspergers,"A little backstory: I touch everything. Okay, not literally everything, but a lot of things. Including things I’m probably not supposed to touch. It’s honestly a little extreme.  while back, I decided to name this phenomenon. I invented the word “hypertactile” because it seemed to fit. Hyper- means “too much” and tactile means “touch”, so hypertactile must mean “touches things too much”, right?  no. I Googled it and hypertactile actually means hypersensitive to tactile things. Which is almost the opposite of what I thought it meant. The term for people like me is “tactile seeking”.  your free vocabulary lesson for the day.I just learned that “hypertactile” is a real word, but it doesn’t mean what I thought it meant.",1634014266,725,119

Not only are you causing the kid to miss out on instructional time, but you are singling them out among their peers, creating an opportunity for social ostracism.  remember being pulled out of class by my occupational therapist in middle school and feeling the stares as I walked out and occasionally a giggle or two. For special ed kids who attend regular general education classrooms, this singles them out as ""the special kid"". Partially as a result of this, I hated therapy as a kid.  do you guys think, is my idea that this should be made illegal a little extreme? There's a law (at least where I am) against creating special lunch lines for kids who get free school lunches to prevent singling them out to be made fun of, so I don't think there's a total lack of precedent for it.It should be illegal to pull kids out of class for therapy.",1634002686,967,176

Literally spent day in and day out with some of these kids from the age of 5 to the age of 16. ome 4 or 5 hours a day. We basically grew up together. For 11 YEAR of our lives. And none of them have once reached out to me since.  says friendship is easy. But it’s damn near impossible in a social media age. If you don’t keep up with latest trend, you are a nobody. Go offline for more than a week and you no longer ‘exist’. I speak to none of them. Despite multiple attempts. It’s not even like I don’t have friends. It’s that I just don’t have people who seem to want my company. It’s really weird. Can that many people be so narrow minded or ‘busy’? have tried to reach out to some of my “high school friends”. The guys / girls I used to consider close friends. The ones I’d spend mornings, lunchtimes and school trips with. But they no longer want to know me.

Or am I missing something. urely out of 500+ people that were once a daily interaction in my life, you’d think at least 1 or 2 would have at least tried to keep in contact. just feels like I’m always the person messaging first or arranging stuff. And if I didn’t do that. I’d fall off the face of the earth. How do NTs manage to keep up friendships? It seems so impossible. And growing up just at the turn of social media, it feels that life was so much more enjoyable without it. literally just a normal guy. Have always been nice. Worked really hard in school. And always did anything for anybody. But nobody wants to know me as we’ve ‘got older’. We’re still the same people.

Mainly because she treats others badly on the basis that she has in turn been treated badly by the world. I see this person rarely for this reason. Think deliberately shouting abuse at others and constantly making snide remarks. My partner is very empathetic towards her and is sensitive to the fact that she has had a hard time. I on the other hand have difficulty dealing with the intense negativity and with someone who seems to think they can treat others any way they like just because they've had a hard time of it.  she got intensely drunk when we were out and started shouting at me and finger wagging at me up close. It was an argument about something trivial (think about the difference between tastes in whiskey) I asked them to stop and they got louder and continued. I asked them one more time matching their tone and when they didn't, I said that I was leaving and I left. I regret letting myself get so worked up about it. should mention that this person assigned gender reasons to the reason we fought. Apparently transwomen and cis women can't get along according to her. he recently transitioned and has seemed to use it as additional fuel for her persecution complex.

I still haven't gotten a life yet and with COVID and people's stupidity messing things up I'm afraid I never will. I've often find myself habitualizing the incel mindset but I remember I'm still not boyfriend or husband material. But I prefer to lose my virginity to a friend as I find it sexier and presumably faster. biggest obstacle right now is time. Being a virgin means different things to different people. I can't speak for other spectrum members (Aspie sounds a little derogatory) but for me it's tied to my sense of self living. Most of the time I feel like I should be embarrassed for feeling frustrated about being a virgin. But in reality it's other people's responses that bothers me. It feels like Toxic Positivity coming from those who are lucky enough to have lost it already or perfectly fine with still being a virgin.  to me is huge part of life that should not be downplayed or demonized.

Losing your virginity especially if it's not fun like you hoped is a life experience everyone should have,  neurotypical or atypical.

I’ve been aware of my Asperger’s for a long time, but only got the official diagnosis from a psych. around a year ago. I originally approached therapy and psychiatry as a potential solution to my issues, but the process has only made my personal awareness more obtrusive. On top of AD, I’ve been observed for comorbidity with chizoid PD, chizophrenia, APD, and paranoia. In general, seeking help has been mostly mental health facades, hours being asked rhetorical questions with no goals of solvency, and very little success in getting any of this weight off of my shoulders.  I’m back at college in a vastly different landscape than the middle of nowhere farm that I have been so fortunate to call home. I was under the impression that I had found a good way to keep myself stable and well, but I am feeling the illness crawling up in ways that scare me. Explaining it is a whole other ordeal unfortunately. Being kind, helpful, and content is what I feel I was designed to do. I’ve been privileged to have come from a long line of strong, patient, determined, and compassionate men. My parents always tell me about how compassionate, lively, and fun I was when I was younger. I spent a lot of time with them during Zoom university last year, and they always took the time to tell me how good it was to see me being truly joyful and expressive. That healthy, mentally coherent person I have tried so hard to support and sustain has been getting buried recently. I’d refer to it as a chronic rage spiral, but at this point, it’s more of a delusion and paranoia fueled wrath of the biblical kind. When I’m worn out from internalizing hatred, I get to experience half lucid apathy. At best, I am not currently aware of any way to mitigate this experience. At worst, I am more interested in sharing the suffering. As it’s said, if I can’t make it better, I can stay awake knowing I can always make it worse. I have been doing my best to isolate when I can and be friendly when I can’t, but I’m just tired of mitigating now. I am soberly aware of how unsustainable this is and the complexity that comes along with finding and receiving the proper help, so I would greatly appreciate any words of wisdom or suggestions for good first steps in getting back to business as usual (I read the post rules and am not soliciting medical advice, just possible resources or new perspectives).

Autism primarily is a ""social disorder"", perhaps above all else.  don't believe we will ever replicate the full range of human facial expressions and do it naturally enough to ""pass as human"". Apparently this is because we didn't make proper eye contact with the mother in the first year of life as a baby. maybe in public, we should just hide our face more often, to make up for the poor facial expressions. Or just openly tell people we have autism and thus ignore our facial expressions. putting that to the side... single most important thing I ever learned about socialising. has NOTHING to do with the words you are using. is ENTIRELY to do with the TIMING of the words you are using. put it this way. Before you go into the social arena, you should have already ""listened in"" and ""studied"" so many 1,000s of conversations, that you already know which words are appropriate and inappropriate to use, so that the words come naturally. other words, in any given social setting, you shouldn't be thinking through your words at all. You should already ""know what to do"" say, you study for a school exam. You spend theoretically unlimited time studying for this school exam. But once you have studied for it, you are ready.  then, once studying is finished, you go and ""do"" the exam. There is a time limit in school exams, say, 2 hours. Thus, when each question comes up in the exam, you actually have a very quick answer, ready to go. You are barely even thinking about the question, because you already ""rehearsed"" the answer. fact, the real key to passing an exam is Going away and taking as much time as needed to learn the material before the exam2. But then during the exam, doing the inverse, and answering the questions as quickly as possible, and with an overall time limit of 2 hours, versus no time limit in revising, and no time limit in learning. so we are dealing with a ""backbone"" of a long time limit, and then, ""short bursts"" of answering questions. is no different to doing an exercise workout, and you might intensively do 100 push-ups in the gym. Then, you take a breather for a few minutes. Then, you do 10 bench presses. prior to even going to the gym for the first time, you watch videos or watch others in the gym, doing these bench presses and exercises, to learn what they are at all, and even the longer you watch, you see the ways that these exercises can go wrong, and what to do in these situations. so, I believe, that socialising is exactly the same. go away, watch as much ""human"" interaction as possible. Note that this isn't just people talking, because people think it's creepy if you are listening to them, and might even alter their conversations as a result.  even just, watch YouTube videos of people talking. Or, you know what we all did in school classrooms, of listening into conversations. but go back 100 years ago. 100 years ago, the average person was illiterate. socialising has been developing for millions of years. And yet, human language is much newer. can socialising have anything to do with WORD, if human beings were illiterate 100s of years ago? can socialising have anything to do with words, when cities are MULTI-LINGUAL, IMMIGRANT type cities? Notice how colleagues of different language all work and live together etc? have seen successful relationships, like dating, where it was a native English speaker girl, and the guy was an Indian who spoke very poor English, and somehow they were still dating. shows you just how little anything has to do with WORD, and the accuracy of WORD, and the precision and truth of WORD. is quite the opposite, and people resent you and hate you for using TOO MANY WORD. scores were ridiculously low even 100 years ago in America, compared to now. The average person in America, 100 years ago, I believe, was illiterate. fact, I think even now in Canada, currently 1/2 of all people are financially illiterate. what is going on here? Other than things like, insulting people, getting too easily offended, reacting too much to other people.... I don't see how socialising can possibly be about the particular words you are using. about it like this as well. if someone asked you a question casually, and you answered with a 10-minute rant. You are demonstrating a lack of self-discipline, in not being able to stop talking. You are taking up their time, which is intimidating to them. And if everyone were to answer questions like this, then there would be no time for productive work in our world, and thus, we would all be unemployed etc. the thing that you are doing, imagine that everyone did it like that. Thus, we must give concise answers to things. should we give answers to things at all? Narcissists actually think you are gullible, or even, controllable, if you actually give an honest answer to them at all. is the problem with giving an honest answer to someone's question? They could then just ""spam"" out questions all day long. You are then straining your brain to come up with the ""correct"" or ""thorough"" answer to their question. Overthinking, by the way, causes depression, or is linked to it, or you tend to overthink when in a depressive cycle. But how to break the cycle? By not overthinking. if you answered every person's question honestly. But then, they could ask you a 2nd question, a 3rd question. They could even like, say, in an IT tech support perspective, kind of deliberately break the computer, just to make work for you, in fixing it. Do you see how they can ""wind you up"", here? the correct place to obtain information, is actually from books, videos, articles, qualified doctors. The source of correct information is a central source that everyone reads. when you are individually answering people's questions, in a ""peer to peer"" perspective, you are actually just wasting everyone's time. That's not to say that you can't help people sometimes. But I often think that helping people should be someone just interjecting that into your life, rather than you asking, and then they answer. After all, if they help you without prompt it shows they have put in the effort into watching you, to see what you are doing wrong, to then help you. That shows that they are at least putting in effort here. here is another concept. Imagine if you were socialising with someone, who actually was deaf. What if they literally were deaf? Then, is this to say, we socially exclude everyone who is deaf? Or what if your best friend was hard on hearing, even if not entirely deaf? OK, so we are supposed to include people even if they are deaf.  this even further proves that socialising has less and less to do with the actual words! the more words you use, the more words they are going to fail to hear. They will just skip and miss out words altogether.  The more complex it is what you are saying, the more of it they will misunderstand or misinterpret. do you see how it works? People with ADHD and autism are are often bullied. But people with ADHD + autism are known for being ""sensory sensitive"" and ""over-reacting"", or ""too quickly reacting"".  enough, narcissists see you as an extension of their own body. Thus, when you react quickly, they see that as their cue that you are on their string. They have just ""invisibly"" controlled you. And then they will keep doing this. you react in a delayed way to someone, then that also gives you time to think as well. In the mean time, you could maybe do a social ""cue"" though, to at least demonstrate that you have heard them. Who knows?  overall, I want you to think about timing here. it has to be about timing. now how about choice? Why do you believe that the FIRT person you ever meet, is going to be your best friend, or the first person you ever date, is going to be your wife eventually? you believed, the first person you ever met, will be ""the one"", then you are somehow a psychic, or the world's greatest pre-judger of people, to where every person you meet, is somehow the correct person, and you knew in advance, and it was all pre-planned, or in a paranoid sense, maybe they found you because they are a spy or God knows how mentally ill this can get, when you believe that the ""first"" person, must be the correct person. about people who are stuck with their abusive families. Well, your mother is possibly the first person you ever bonded with. And yet, mothers can be abusive to their kids. They often are. Lots of autistic people fled their families and have no relationship with them. imagine if you talked with loads of words, to each new person you met. Thus, the first person you ever met, you are talking to them 1 hour at a time back and forth. would therefore leave, no TIME left to talk and meet other people. Thus, the more you go on and on talking ot the same person, the more this person occupies ALL of your time, and the less time you have to ever meet other people!  like imagine time as a physical space, and you are pouring concrete into it, in liquid form, and it is setting and setting, and now there is no space left. You have occupied all the time takling to this one person, and the more you do this, the less time there is for other people. Thus, this one person BETTER BE the best person you ever met, because the way you are dong it with the timing, this is going to be the ONLY ONE. it's all about ""light touches"". it's all about ""short interactions"" with a person, followed by a break, followed by another ""light interaction"" like in a day job, you are doing 100s of micro-tasks a day. OK, so, you do one task. Then break. Then one task. Lots of micro tasks and micro breaks throughout the day!The most important thing I ever learned about socialising",1633932820,9687,1740
aspergers,"o if anyone goes through my post history, I tend to overthink and get upset. This is the newest that I have, just wanted to know what you guys think or an advise how to handle these talk of I should have. here is the thing. I love my bf(A) and he loves me, I don't have a doubt In that. I am just listing out a situation which kind of annoys me a lot but I don't know its insecurity or genuine concern.  my bf and I live more than an hour away from each other. I had to be patient for more than an year for him to be comfortable around me. For example till last year he used to come meet me and leave in 4-5 hours. Now he stays over so that was a progress. But I realised something today. When he wants to leave from my house, he won't listen to me to stay over a bit more saying he has to study for his exams(last year) or today he said he has to go home early coz he is starting a new job tomorrow. Now I don't mind him leaving early for that. But he then said he would meet his friend before going back home and I don't have problem with that too. is the problem: I have noticed that he would say that he doesn't have time to stay a bit more with me but would stay with friends for long( for example today he told me he needs to sleep early for new job tomorrow and relax at home so he needed to go  early. He is at their place and he bolted from my house early after me requesting to stay a bit more. He is at his friend's house past his bedtime and he starts his new job next day). He says he doesn't watch TV show or movies, but he watches movies with them not with me. here are the things because of which I think it's overthinking. He hardly meets his friends. He met them thrice in last year but he meets me often almost every weekend since may this year. They have 4 dogs and he loves dogs so I think it reduces his anxiety. thing is I don't mind him meeting his friends( I sometime suggest him to meet them and he would say no), if he says he wants to meet them of course I don't have problem. He should meet them instead of me. But when he says I can't come cause I am busy studying or have to rest before I go to work and then go to his friend's place and hang out there instead, that seems too disrespectful to me. I feel like I am cause of his anxiety and he is making excuses to just get away.  this might be just my emotional response and not a big deal. Am I justified in this concern? If I am and I have to point it out to him, how can I point it out without him thinking I don't want him to meet his friends. I just want him to be open and honest about his motives(well not sure the right word not a native English speaker). I would love to hear aspie side. realised in graduate school I have a lot of mental issues that I should acknowledge. o anyone who says go to therapy I am doing therapy but it's for me and they are not an aspie expert.  here I am asking your thoughts on this.Need an AS perspective on this, am I overthinking?",1633931329,2954,607

aspergers,"Hi all. New to this sub so I apologize if this isn’t how I should go about this. I’m also new to AD terminology in general so corrections on faux pas would be good. I’m still very much trying to figure out DM-V so forgive me if my terminology is dated. This is also going to be crazy long because I literally have nobody with life experience to talk to about this and figured backstory is important.  year, my 6 year old daughter (then 5) was diagnosed with ADHD (inattentive) and provisionally diagnosed with high functioning AD. The psychologist who made this provisional diagnosis basically said in DM IV it would be called Asperger’s, so here I am. The psych made it “provisional” because she is so young, she is female and ADHD can make it even trickier to decide where she actually falls. he was also diagnosed with sensory processing disorder at 4 but that kinda mixes in with the other two as well.  background info: I am also ADHD inattentive (fka ADD) and I have severe OCD.  that’s her background and I can answer questions as to how we came to those conclusions, but I’m wondering if any of you had these problems as kids, or if you see this in your children. went to Disney exactly 2 months ago. A week before we went, she had a little non covid virus with a cough, but the cough was only really there in the morning during the entire trip. This is relevant for later.  was definitely over stimulated at times, but her sensory stuff is usually food related at this point unless she gets overwhelmed with just TOO MUCH where she melts down. I went against my gut and brought my child, my poor baby, on Tower of Terror which I even fucking hate. The other 6 yo we were with loves thrill rides so we just shrugged and hoped for the best. he was already overwhelmed from a small coaster right before where she cried but again, ignore my gut feeling. It was too much and she melted down and was basically disconnected or crying the rest of the day. My husband and I made sure to make her feel extra secure and grounded and safe but damage was done.  we got home from this trip, she was not the same kid. he quickly developed a fear of ghosts (Tower of Terror apparently has creepy shit which I never even noticed because my eyes are generally closed the entire ride). he began asking if ghosts were real many times a day. My husband made the mistake of telling her a ~spooky story~ about a ghost he thought he saw and she didn’t get the nuance between story and 100% real. o that fear ramped the fuck up.  after this fear she started checking on me. o, when she’s playing in the other room I’ll go “Hey Delilah?” “Yeah?” “Just checking on ya!” As parents do. he started doing this to me which was cute at first but then it ramped up to multiple times a day. Then multiple times an hour. I walked behind her chair one foot behind her and she did it. I called her out on not having to check on me, so she cleverly switched it to “mommy?” “Yeah? “I love you!” “Love you too” “You’re the best.” Cute but not 8 times an hour cute. Not when I cross the threshold into another room cute. Always in the same order. In fact it has gotten to this point  mommy?Me: yeah?D: love you!Me: love you too!D: love you, you’re the best!Me: Delilah, I love you too baby but you can stop checking on me. D: love you!  compulsive 100%, coming from a person with fear based compulsions that started at about 8 years old.

It’s clustered mostly at night, sometimes in the mornings and scattered throughout the day. A kid is bullying her for having a cough. We’ve gone to the pediatrician who sent us to an allergist who prescribed her an allergy/asthma medication and two types of inhalers until she can see her in person. Nothing is working. I am starting to think this might be related to the above fears/compulsions.  she has an appointment with a pediatric OCD psychiatrist who will assess her end send her to the right sort of pediatric mental health doctors.  also see pulmonologist and allergist this week.  long. o, guys, does any of this sound like it could be little kid you?

aspergers,"There's a guy named Daniel Kahneman, an economist, who came up with a question. He says to imagine that you've selected somebody at random from your country. After picking this person randomly from the crowd, you are told that this person has been described as ""very shy and withdrawn, invariably helpful but with little interest in people or in the world of reality. A meek and tidy soul, he has a need for order and structure, and a passion for detail."" asks: Is this person more likely to be a librarian or a farmer? What do you think? ee if you can answer the question before you reveal the next paragraph. &gt;!Kahneman found that most people he asked said ""librarian"". But if that's all you know about this person, you should say ""farmer""! There are going to be far more farmers than there are librarians in the world, to begin with. And even if librarians are several times more likely to fit that description than are your typical farmer, there are enough farmers in the world that even if some small percentage of them are ""shy and withdrawn"" and so on, it's stil more likely that the person is a farmer, just based on sheer numbers.!&lt; won a Nobel Prize for his work in that area. It irritates me a little though. He says that this reveals how people can be irrational and not take information into account when they're thinking about what's true. But as an autistic person, I have answered lots of questions where I took into account information that I had and it made my answer *wrong*! I remember taking a driving test when I was in my 20's and there were several questions that confused me and I ended up failing the test. As an example, one question was ""What is more important to limit your speed? The speed limit? The weather? Or how fast others are going?"" knew that it wasn't ""how fast others are going"". You're usually supposed to follow the law no matter what others are doing. o is it the speed limit or the weather? The answer they wanted was ""the weather"", but I had answered ""speed limit"". I know that if it's pouring down rain and you can't see very far, you're gonna have to drive more slowly. But on the converse, if it's a clear day with beautiful weather and not a cloud in the sky, that doesn't mean you can suddenly go as fast as you want! You still have to obey the speed limit! o ultimately, how fast you can go is limited by the posted speed limit. Weather can make it so you have to go slower, but of the three things, speed limit always wins. what they wanted you to know is that weather will be factor, and I failed my driving test. At best there's simply a difference in the way I was thinking about it and they way they were thinking about it. But even more so, I still think my way of thinking was more right. experience, and many others like it, have taught me that when someone is framing a question to you, it usually means that they are looking for something specific. That stupid Kahneman librarian/farmer question above supposedly reveals that people don't think about all the factors, but it seems to me that when people ask questions like this and you're *not* in the real world, you *shouldn't* take all the factors into consideration!

aspergers,"Hello, I wanted to pop on here to get advice on my anxiety about not getting a diagnosis. This might be a bit long, but please stick with me. always felt like I was a bit weird compared to other people. As a kid, I had friends but I still much preferred adults. I would talk to anyone and say inappropriate things, like any kid would. got good grades all round, and was especially good at English, creative writing and art. I did some weird things, but when you’re a young kid it’s pretty normal. ure, I watched Finding Nemo everyday for years, but little kids are weird.  I never seemed to grow out of the weirdness and inappropriate-ness. (If that’s a word.) I would be called rude and couldn’t understand why. People would say I was shouting when I wasn’t. People would say I was invading their personal space, but I’m just standing next to them in my head. I found change extremely difficult and thought people were angry at me when they weren’t.  got my first intense obsession at around 7. Harry Potter; pretty standard. But it got extremely intense as it progressed, to the point of me non-stop talking about it and referencing it constantly. Everyone thought it was weird, but it was my ‘thing.’ started having some serious friendship issues at the end of primary school. I was also very close to my teacher, who was somewhat of a father figure to me. When we went on our Year 6 trip, everyone else loved it. I hated it. I hated not having my mum and being surrounded by weird people. I clung to teachers because I didn’t want to be around other people. went downhill when I went to secondary school. I’m not going to get into it, but a lot of things happened at once and I became extremely depressed. My obsessions were at an unhealthy level; they were the only thing I had left. My friendship issues persisted, and I had an ongoing issue with an abusive friend who manipulated me and went above and beyond what I thought a person could. he had to leave my school, but it didn’t get better. mental health plummeted yet further at 12. I was in and out of hospital. I was having meltdowns everyday. creaming, thrashing, uncontrollable. It was around this time a health care professional from a hospital I ended up going to brought up the idea of having Aspergers to my mum. I was flipping over tables and banging my head over a hospital bed at the time, so I wasn’t really present in the conversation.  mum didn’t bring it up to me. It wasn’t until my family therapist sat me down with my mum and said to me ‘we think you might have Aspergers’ that it was brought up to me. He explained it was high functioning autism. When he told me the traits, I couldn’t control my happiness. All the things my other mental diagnosis hadn’t covered, my obsessions, my social issues, the weird quirks I had.  mum explained she hadn’t brought it up until they were pretty sure I had it because she knew I would latch onto it. Research every trait. Obviously she was right. then on, I was treated with the idea that I was autistic. The process of getting a diagnosis takes a long time, but in the waiting period I was treated like I had one. My younger cousin got her diagnosis after waiting years, years of intense sensory issues that left her secluded from peers. brings us to today. The only part of my diagnosis I have left is the final appointment, which could happen anywhere in the next year. Every single health care professional (aside from one nurse because I made eye contact with her because I liked her) said they strongly believe I’m autistic. My key worker at school, who’s an expert on autism and spent years being part of the diagnostic team, strongly believes I do. But she’s thought that about other kids who ended up not getting a diagnosis. all of that, I’m terrified I won’t get my AD diagnosis. I don’t have very severe sensory issues (I have some but they’re mild; I do use fidget toys constantly which helps me cope) and don’t relate to a lot of autism memes and such. I make eye contact with people I know well and feel comfortable with, but even then it feels strange. I feel like now I’m aware that I might be on the spectrum, I’ve been having more symptoms of the disorder than I had when I was younger. I don’t know if that’s because I’m more aware of it now, because I’m not masking, or some other reason.  am so mentally exhausted constantly but that’s in large part to my other issues. I know there’s a lot of people who don’t get diagnosed, and I will have the right support even if I don’t, but I can’t comprehend the thought of after all of that, I don’t get a diagnosis.  was super long and I’ll be super surprised if anyone reads all this, but if you’re here, thank you. This is more me getting what’s on my mind down than anything else. But if someone likeminded could give me advice or guidance, it would be much, much appreciated. I talk constantly to my support system about my fears of not being diagnosed and they tell me not to worry about it unless it happens and that they’ll appeal if I don’t get it.  thanks.Terrified of not getting my diagnosis",1633884509,5085,940

Can't drive. let's even just be a simple security guard where we guard some building or something, and ah, job description says we need a driving license. let's work in a care home for the elderly, and ah, nope. Wants a driving license! anyone have any tips for psychological tips for driving a car? it come down to things like, excessive ""checking"" behaviour? we need to simply filter the number of inputs that we are ""checking"" for? is going on? Why do we struggle so much with the psychology of driving? And I say, ""psychology"", because I do believe that it's a psychological state of mind that we are in, as to why we can't drive. don't think it's a conspiracy, like, they should make the roads wider, or the driving test easier. There is some psychological state of mind with autism, where we can't drive.Autistic people can't get many jobs simply because we can't drive",1633843433,1468,264
aspergers,"Today my mother unloaded on me about how much I've screwed up my life. he spent 1/2 of the time blaming herself and half blaming me. The only blame she took was not being harder on me so I learn to ""grow up"" better. he blamed me for walking away from things that I didn't want to do or knew deep down I couldn't handle. I've been working since I was 16 at hard jobs that burned me out over and over. Construction, customer service, other manual labor, all very overwhelming to the senses. Yet I can't get ahead in life, I can't form the right relationships at work to move up, I'm too scared to take new jobs that I don't know anything about or anyone that works there, so I keep ending up in dead in jobs making just enough to get by. ince covid hit, things have gotten so bad for me now that I'm really struggling, mentally, physically, and financially. At this point I'm stuck trying to find a new job that I feel like I can do, I've been looking but it's not easy for me. After a through ass chewing about how I was the fault for my relationships falling apart because I didn't make enough money (except I was working 3 jobs about 70 hours a week to provide for them because ""that's what men do"" causing full burnout) I finally said to her ""YE MOM I'M A PIECE OF HIT, I've fucked up my life and I don't know how to fix it. Every choice I've made has been wrong when I thought it was right, every thing I've tried I've failed at, everything I think I should be able to do I haven't been able to do. I've done this because I've spent my whole life being told I'm normal that I should be able to do these things, that I should live how everyone else says and does. Well I'm not, I'm not normal and I've been living my entire life with one hand tied behind my back without even knowing it."" The truth is I don't blame anyone, high functioning or aspergers wasn't even a thing when I was a kid, no one knew, they just said I was the smart/weird kid. I think it finally hit her that I have been trying, that maybe there is something different about me, that I just want a normal life, but can't seem to figure out how to.The only way I could get my mother to accept that I'm autistic was to tell her I'm a piece of ****",1633840946,2217,438
aspergers,"I (NT)have been friends with my supervisor (Aspie)for around 5 years.  We became friends after he left work.  We used to catch up for regular coffees and then he returned to work.  Coffees continued, we got closer.  He’s very private yet he would share pretty personal things With me and I with him.  He would ask questions of me etc.  I admit I liked him way more than I should, it seemed he liked me as much.   of a sudden he stopped meeting me, and when i would ask he’d laugh.  Just seemed a happy laugh.  Which was always his response but then he would say yes a day or two later.  He then moved out of our office, without telling me.  uddenly pretends he doesn’t notice me and avoids eye contact with me when it was always there.  Yet about once a week would sit down with me and chat.   then emailed him (as it’s always better to give him time to respond) and asked him why he’s treating me like I don’t exist.  That I would appreciate a conversation.  He replied in a sterile, let’scatch up and I’ll give you clarity.  Unfortunately, he walks in and states ‘I won’t be meeting up with you for coffee anymore!’  I get emotional and ask why.  With a hand on his heart, looking me in the eyes, he entreats ’I really, really, would love to be your friend but…..’ left off there with a long pause.  He then tells me ‘I have a lot going on in my life.  As you know I am a very private person, and I don’t have sp…’, then he tells me he still want me to pop in and chat to him, that he likes my company, loves my company and continues to tell me that he has shared more with me than anyone else.  Then as he turns his back on me for awhile and doesn’t turn back, I walk away. forward he cuts me off when I chat to him, then will sit down and have a lunch with me every week, without ever responding to my emails, even professional ones until last minute.  I still have to work with him.  Quite closely.  I walk in sometimes and get a beaming smile flash on his face, then he shuts down and won’t even look at me during our meetings. am trying to understand.  I get it’s over, in my head, but my heart is broken.  I always expected typical bluntness.  That he would tell me if he wasn’t interested.  We had been friends for a long time, very close.

aspergers,Needed to get stuff this off ny chest and i wanted y'all's opinion. in high school. I hated everyone and everything. now I just hate them less i guess. ive seen and experienced too much bullshit in my life im not surprised im so jaded. I wasnt beaten up or anything well only once. but since i have bipolar disorder and Asperger's syndrome it was a really nasty combo that completely fucked up my brain chemistry. i just got so fed up with being mad and confused all the time that i just shut myself off from everyone at school except my best freind  who is like a second brother to me. Like I dunno if it's partly my fault for over reacting but getting harassed amd made fun every single day and on a regular basis your anger boils up and you explode. Also they know i get angry easily hence why i was bullied alot. In late middle school and most of high school i did the minimum work required and just got a C across the board just to get through the grades. I mostly just goofed around and did whatever i wanted and ignored the teachers in fact i insulted them and poked fun at there insecurity's. like being old or fat. It's hypocritical yea but i just gave no fucks at that point because they held me back from 12 grade despite getting a C which is the minimum and passing. and now today im 23 with GED a apartment and a amazing relationship with my family. orry if i dumped my life story but im tired asf and i get like this when i am tired. also i didn't really disrespect the teachers until near the end when i got held back. Because then i knew they were against me. i had to wait a year till i was 18 to quit. They tried to send like a police officer or whatever to drag me back to school 🤣 lmao.My life story.,1633835934,1720,338

And what if i don't have anything wrong i would feel so fucking stupid and my credibility would be one the line. know it's mainly me being a paranoid shit but i just want answers without feeling judge or anything you know, and also i don't know if this is going to make my family and friend treat me different like being treated like I'm useless or as a way of discreating me. any advice/similar story and just good vibes will be gladly appreciate.How do I tell my parents i might have Asperger?",1633835023,1380,256

aspergers,"Like many of y'all, I deal with Asperger's and ADHD. I'm a 21 yo guy. I'm socially awkward, deal with overwhelming social anxiety and depression and self hate. Despite never having a meltdown, I've gotten to low points so much that I can't remember what it's like to be happy and have nothing going for me. I have no friends, no relationship, and everyone who's shown interest in me (mostly online) has quickly lost interest, not that I blame them tbh.  deliver pizzas for Domino's, and as a autistic guy it's not easy, yet I've somehow been making it here for the last 2 and a half years. Work is the only place where I could get out of my depression at least somewhat. But now there's a girl who works here who I have a hard crush on, despite her already being in a relationship with a coworker. Yet, I still keep freezing up, stuttering, and just making a pathetic fool of myself, that now I don't even feel safe from my own mind at work anymore. I'm just more reminded of how autistic I am and why I hate myself. I had gotten to the point a few months ago where I just wanted to break down and cry and let these emotions that I don't know I'm feeling out. But I couldn't, and that just depressed me more, that I can't even *cry* right. tonight I just feel like I embarrassed myself in front of that girl I like. Wasn't even the worst instance, but that was the point I broke mentally. I kept in, kept on my fake smile, until I got into the car on my next delivery. I started seething with rage and self hatred. I typically only feel a sadness when I'm depressed, but this time was pure anger. I kept berating myself, listing the long list of reasons why I feel this way. Turned the music so loud I was bursting my eardrums just to drown out the voices in my head. Made my delivery, put that fake smile back on, and went back to the store. But scrolling through r/depression (top all time) I read something that I absolutely relate to: ""the worst part of depression is that deep deep down, that's how you *want* to feel"". anger vanished and I had to rush to the bathroom where I broke down and finally cried like I had tbeen wanting to do for so long. The worst part is that I'm not even feeling better like I was hoping. I'm out now, standing in the back of the store away from everyone else as I'm typing this, wanting to break down again, but I'm trying to make through the rest of my shift. this breakdown was triggered by an embarrassing moment in front of my crush who's not even single and is totally out of my league anyways. o pathetic really.  sorry for such a long post, I just needed to get this off my chest in a different way besides anger or crying.I finally broke down",1633827584,2687,515

I don’t know what to make of this because it doesn’t seem logical to me at all? I know for a fact neither of us are ready to have kids at all he said that’s not true because it would just suddenly instantly change once he actually has kids and he’ll understand emotions better and he’d be fit to bring up a child, which doesn’t even make sense to me because that’s not something that happens just because you’ve got a kid in my opinion .

I had neck surgery in March of 2020, and I did zero exercise until January of 2021. Anything that requires shoulder muscles aggravates the neck, so I've been avoiding it. A therapist suggested trauma as the cause. Four doctors have no idea. know my wife othered me for twenty years. Her whole family is on brain drugs, and her hostility toward me started when our now-20-year-old son was about 1 year old. he just couldn't be nice to me. I begged her to stop being mean, and she treated that like everything else about me: dismissed it, tried to turn it into a personal attack on her. Being othered in your own home for 20 years is trauma, especially when it comes every day from someone who allegedly loves you. kids in the early chased me away or tried to beat me up. I was dissociating in second grade. But they weren't obligated to be nice to me. my dad- my brother's father hated me as soon as my personality developed. I wasn't his son, and he has contempt for college people, managers, anyone smarter than him. He ridiculed me. He even body-slammed me once. Picked me up over his head and WHAM on the ground.

I was twelve, and Jimi was a rock star. o he was mean AND stupid. Another person who was supposed to be my trusted guardian. book I'm reading is implying that I had emotions, but I shut them off to deal with the continuous trauma. I think I need talk therapy with a trauma specialist to come up with memories from the early years. I only have a few, but my memory is infallible. I remember a whole lot from adolescence. Asperger's people have obstacles to honest, real-time emotion, because we don't use our amygdala for that. But I'm estranged from my daughter and have no feelings about it one way or the other. The book also explains how many of the kids with labels like Bipolar are really acting out as a result of the was trauma rewired their minds. I live in the United tates, and I'm between jobs- so I have zero value to the American people. I hate that this backward nation of high school graduates has no self-interest. Just tribes trying to get ahead of each other. Americans think people like doctors deserve to be held above the rest of us, and they hate the idea of the other getting anything for free.

It kind of explains a lot of what I remember of him over the years. it's useless to feel guilty for what I couldn't help when we were kids, I just wish families with people in the spectrum could get support more easily. It's groundbreaking to realize, that under the shadow of ensuring any kind of support for me, his special needs have been dire as well. He's just been better at masking those needs. it seems our generation has to rely on aging and seeing our behavior more as different ways of masking, rather than what we actually are. I've always known, in a way, that ""a normal life"" wouldn't work for him either, if anybody these days. Though as services and environments where our needs are taken into account will be scarce, living a life that we'd want will be a matter of relentless improvisation for so many. although I used to think being good at personal finances would enable me to retire without stress, we only have so much time and energy, usually less than we'd want to. o, maybe all this will inspire me to become one of the ""experts by experience.""

At first I didn’t do shit, I just stayed in his room depressed wouldn’t follow any of my advice to get himself in a better situation to actually get a job, start saving some money while we were paying his rent for free. wanted to teach his boss a lesson because he felt like he could show up to work anytime he felt like. he ended up teaching him a lesson and he got fired twice from two different jobs because he wanted to do things his own way and didn’t realize or never understands why the world is against him. has given me so much shit over the years that I have been married to his mother when all I have try to do is help him out, make sure he’s successful happy healthy and all I get is flack in return. he was doing so bad and was so depressed still no girlfriend, I helped him (because he wanted to do things absolutely 100% on his own, his own way always) I helped him learn how to budget at 28 years old, never having a girlfriend, he learned how to budget started saving some money, learned how to keep a job, matured and found himself his first girlfriend who recently dumped him. still undiagnosed, no matter what I say, no matter what I do, nothing is ever right and it gives me anxiety when ever I have to deal with him because Lord knows if I say the ‘wrong’ thing it’s gonna set him off and he’ll hold onto it FOREVER. night I sent him a text because I have noticed ever since the break up with his girlfriend he’s been asking for a little money here a little money there, have us pay for his car insurance this month, have us pay for a car accident that he was just in, so I say to him that to ‘put his pride aside, that it doesn’t take a genius to see that he’s on the mend financially, and we want to help him get back on his feet financially during this process..’ response back… But that’s typical… He will go days if he doesn’t need you, he completely forgets about you and doesn’t text back.

aspergers,"Have you ever noticed, that lower-functioning autistics, will do ""duplicating"" behaviour? have a younger brother, who is lower-functioning autistic, and will literally copy what I do. Very little copying even, like, if I am staying up late, he stays up late. If I am not watching the TV, he will get up and stop watching it. the DM basically seems to believe now, that lower and higher-functioning autism are much the same ""autism"". They have rolled both into a diagnosis of ""AD"", and ditched the ""Asperger's"" diagnosis. if lower-functioning autistics have this desire to copy things all the time, then so do we. what does it mean, to copy something? And copy what, exactly? And how long does it take us to copy something, so we can move on? example, I used to write a lot of diaries, and I still do. I would write these big lengthy diaries of my thoughts. This is helpful for ADHD because we have a poor working memory, and thus, the solution is to externalise things. writing diaries can also be described as simple ""copying"" behaviour. we are ""copying"" our internal thoughts onto paper, as best we can.  would strongly recommend writing such a diary, at least when first working out your strategy or routine for the day, or for life, because we are clumsy when put on the spot. the point is this. What about all these other times, where we get upset about a particular thing, and then we want on and on about it? It's tempting to think, we are upset about a particular thing in general, and maybe we are. have you considered, that when we are upset about something, our brain really just wants to make a copy of it? that definition, how might a laptop connected to a TV via HDMI cable help with that? you have ""screen mirroring"" set up on Windows, and now the laptop screen precisely mirrors the TV screen. Now, you can simply occasionally take a brief glance over to the laptop, and then back to the TV. enough, this also may or may not mimick the side to side eye movement used in EMDR therapy and I'm sure a lot of us have some kind of trauma built up for sure. other advantage of plugging a laptop into a TV, is that it keeps the screen at head height. They have shown in ADHD subreddit, that it's useful to have a screen line up with your eyes. This seems to impact your attention span massively, if the screen keeps shifting up and down all the time. It feels so much more peaceful having the TV screen at eye line. Of course, your own body will move around, and head, and own eyes, but you can't help yourself doing that. What you can do, is fixate the TV in the same spot, vertically and horizontally, so it just sits there. That's one less odd thing that is moving around and making you nervous. Remember, we get nervous with all these moving things, like cars, people in a shopping. Autistic people panic when anything is moving around in the room, as if it's a whole new room, every time one thing in the room changes. advantages of plugging the laptop into the TV.... also means that we are not shuffling the laptop around on our lap. Less adjusting etc. no sensory issues of the heat of the laptop on our lap. the weight of the laptop on our lap, and some people don't like weight. having a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse instead of laptop and it's now lighter to just get up off of the chair when we want. Less chances of breaking the laptop accidentally if we drop it, since we aren't actually holding the laptop. think that autistic brain is quite efficient, and hates breaking things, losing money etc. Think about the narcissistic autistics who freak out, even if someone accidentally leaves the light bulb on, as if this is costing electricity etc. think that the autistic brain is quite efficient, and realises, why not have a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse on our lap, rather than the laptop. Because if we accidentally break it, that's less money lost. time, I did accidentally trip over my laptop cable and it smashed on the floor and I had to buy another one, or at least, another hard drive. look at that structure too. All we have on our lap now, is the mouse and keyboard. All the power is now away from us. And the laptop itself is then connected to the wider Internet, which is even bigger and more powerful than the laptop. I.e. visualise a data centre. o, look at that highly interesting structure that has now formed.  sure, I do find it interesting to switch my eyes from the TV to the laptop, as a way of, in mere seconds, mimicking this ""duplicating"", ""copying"" or ""mirroring"" behaviour in autism. is efficient, because instead of spending 10 minutes writing out a diary of what I'm thinking, and after enough words, being satisfied that I have sufficiently ""duplicated"" my thoughts.  I take one nice, simple glance over to the laptop, and by all means, hold your eyes there for a few seconds, make your eyes over to the TV, back, forth, and voila, you just did duplicating behaviour with way less time and effort needed.Solve autism ""duplicating"" behaviour by plugging laptop into TV?",1633758720,5019,909

aspergers,"Hello folks,  wanted to share a change I made a few years back, and how it affected my day-to-day life. I do this now because in the last few days there were many depressed voices to be heard here, and many of them suffered from being an outsider. no means do I believe that what worked for me will work for others under all circumstances. In fact, it is obvious that this is not the case. Depending on your surroundings opening up about Aspergers might backfire, but this I cannot judge without knowing you, the people you interact with, or your culture. o, please keep this in mind. I hope my story allows you get a new perspective. did struggle myself with being an outsider, outcast at points, in the past. The worst time period for this was in school. You all know the difficulties that come from Aspergers in this life phase well enough. I entered university I was pretty down from my past experiences, and decided to do something else. I started talking, wore my Aspergers on the sleeve, so to speak. I switched up the way I introduced myself, telling people about my condition almost immediately. omething like:  ""Hey, I'm \*Name\*, just fyi, subtle just doesn't work for me. I struggle to read expressions, it's part of Aspergers, so if I say something unexpected or perhaps even rude, I do apologize, I don't mean to. Please be as blunt as you can about it, because otherwise I cannot improve it.""   what happened? Well, for most people, this is a bit much. Many ask a few questions, than nod, and accept it. The big difference is: now they know why you are weird, or act out of line. ure, some might make assumptions regarding you for it, but guess what? That is by far better than having them make assumptions without knowing what is going on. found people are actually rather welcoming and open towards ""weirdness"" (at least the interesting people), once they know what is going on. But not knowing drives them away from you. They don't know what to expect which makes them uneasy. came to the conclusion that neither option is good (telling, masking), but at least I found one that works better for me. Now, a few years later, I have a loyal circle of friends, coworkers, wo appreciate some of the quirks and advantages that come with Aspergers and are gladly putting up with the downsides in the process, and a working social life.  I the odd one out? ure, but I am no longer an outcast, but accepted in my own right.Once I stopped masking, I was no longer an outsider",1633716207,2483,449

People say it's impossible to be logical, analytical and literal and get along instinctively with other people, but I disagree. I think it's possible to figure out how to use our analytical thinking to our advantage, we just have to put all our heads together and share all of our personal observations we can think of. We all have the capability of learning processes. We're using a phone/computer right now, this means we've learned this one thing, so I think we can learn how to understand people too. learn to mask, but all the tricks we've learned are limited because every skill has to be individually learned only through experiencing it multiple times. There aren't any books that teach us how to mask either. Learning through experience is tiring and confusing, it takes a long time to develop these skills, especially because our brain is so overstimulated in social environments that we don't have the clarity of mind to analyze and critically think about how we should properly act. o I thought if we put our brains together and think of every social skill and observation about neurotypical behavior we've discovered, we can create a learning tool. I'm sure we all have at least one social skill or observation most of us aren't aware of yet.  to list everything you do to blend in with people, this can be social skills, responses you use, behaviors in certain environments, how you should think in certain situations, body language, and observations about people and their reactions.Think about every aspect about the neurotypical world you've analyzed as if you're making a nature documentary. This can be things that confuse you or general behavioral observations. Think of situations that you have difficulty with and think of those skills that help you get by.

I wasn’t working alongside this and I’m still living with my parents but I sort my own laundry, cooking and shopping and solely care for my dog. Yet even the part time study was only ~just~ manageable for me, and I let many other things slip that I needed to get done.

A little bit about me- I’m 19 years old, I was diagnosed with Aspergers syndrome at the age of 12. My mother later told me that I was falsely diagnosed only for purposes of getting longer time on tests in school. I went through a large portion of my life not truly knowing who I really am. That sucked. I was somewhat normal throughout middle school and during my freshman year of high school. Had a large friend group, knew everyone and everyone knew me.       Then everything changed.You see, wether it’s my Aspergers or not, I am very good at picking up on things most people don’t(patterns are my thing). I’d come home to my mother on the phone. he worked nights, and my father worked days. I somehow along the lines picked up the fact that my mother was cheating on my father, and thinking it was ‘the right thing to do’ I told him. This ended in them getting divorced and me being forced to live with my mother, because I found out my father wasn’t really my father. My real father had abandoned us at birth, and this had been my step dad. Entirely different story.        Moving schools really fucked me over. I can’t lie. My entire life changed so drastically over the course of a few months. I lost my support group and struggled insanely hard to find another one even a fraction of the size. I primarily focused on women as a distraction because usually I would only have enough energy in my social battery to form a meaningful connection with one person, so why not have this one person be someone that will love me in ways that friends normally can’t.  Terrible idea. Maybe? I’m not sure of that yet.                 Fast forward back to finding this subreddit. I love it.

aspergers,"Hi all, first up, I want to stress that im not self diagnosising but I have strong suspicions that I have high functioning aspergers. not go into specifics because there's not much point here per se, might as well leave that to the pros, this stance however does raise questions for me. in my mid 30's and have possibly, for a long time tried to mask things potentially aspergers related, and on occasion have just come close to breaking point in terms of day to day stuff that I find it difficult to cope with. have a job, a relationship, everything is stable. the question- other than knowing whether my suspicions are correct or not, just for the sake of knowing, is there really an advantage at this point in life of being diagnosed? What do I actually get out of that other than being provided with a label that says, yep, you different, that's why you feel the way you do? I'm not sure what it would say about me if it were a definitive no. been yo the doctor sparsely in life but when I have, I find it odd that they seem to ask, after explaining the issue, ""what do you want me to do?"" - it's a question I usually struggle with, they are after all the doctor.

aspergers,I want to work in the medical field. I have just been having trouble deciding where. I am an incredibly indecisive person and worry I will choose the wrong career to go to school for and end up hating it. I had talked to my therapist about this. We talked about me maybe working with other autistics and doing research in that field and we also talked about nursing and pharmacy too. I had told him I wanted to become a nurse or a doctor since I was around 19 or so and that before that I had(still have)an interest in psych(it’s a special interest).

aspergers,"My guy (ND, and dating for almost a year now) seems to have some level of aversion to physical touch… I’m not really sure.  We’ve talked about this, and I asked him if it’s because of sensitivity to pressure or just touch in general, and he said no.  I asked if he finds me repulsive, and he said that’s not it, and this has been a “problem” even with ex-girlfriends.  In the beginning his reaction to me playfully touching him is like as if he’s a ninja blocking my hand, or sometimes he would swat me like a fly.  I talked to him about it at least twice in the past and said I felt rejected everytime he does that, so if this (touching) is something he doesn’t like, it will be a problem for both of us if we force it as I can’t continue dating someone I can’t freely give or get physical affection from (and I wouldn’t want him to just tolerate my affection).  His response was it’s not me, it’s an issue even in the past and he’d work on it.  Not gonna lie, it carries over to what happens in the bedroom so it can be frustrating in that aspect at times…..but anyway, fast forward to now.  Things have improved in that he does’t block my attempts to give him physical affection anymore.. or at least not as much…  noticed that there are times he would still block me/my hands for example when I’m trying to touch him (squeeze/caress/somethjng similar), and then he’d catch himself doing that, so he moves closer and lets me touch him.  This happens when he’s stressed out. ometimes he would just be direct and say don’t touch my x body part or he would just remove my hand.  It can be frustrating because this is how I feel close to someone, and if it gives me the feeling that it he’s uncomfortable then it doesn’t really do much.   don’t want to badger him with this topic anymore, or at least I need a bit more time before I bring it up again.  I don’t want him to feel attacked which he’s expressed in other conversations in the past.  But I do want to understand..is it possibly because he doesn’t trust me? I’ve read people say this in relation to physical touch.  Is it possible he can’t explain that there’s tactile discomfort? I don’t want either one of us to be frustrated.

aspergers,"I think I might have really mild aspergers but I'm not completely sure because there some things that don't really make sense to me so I'm trying to figure it out, even though I know I won't know for sure unless I get a professional diagnosis. been looking at symptoms, and one that always comes up is having meltdowns. I don't think I've ever experienced a meltdown. I don't cry much, and my friends even shared with me how often they cry and I don't cry as much as them at all. And when I do cry, it's only because I'm missing my pets that died. I am by far waaay less emotional than any of my friends and people in general. after reading other peoples stories, it seems like there are different forms of meltdowns or shutdowns, and I'm wondering if I'm experiencing it. noticed a pattern where I'll have normal social interactions (like a normal introvert would have) for a few days or weeks, and then I get to a point where I don't want to talk to or see anyone. This period lasts about a week or so before I return back to normal. Nothing ever happens really suddenly though, it's gradual.  happens during this 'shutdown' is that gradually I dont want to talk to people. o when I come out to the kitchen to eat, I don't really want talk to my roommates. Then as it progresses I won't sit by my friends during class and won't say hi to them at all. Talking to people takes a LOT of effort and the entire time I'm just irritated on the inside. Like it's physically and emotionally so hard for me to talk to people during this period. after a week or two I return back to normal, talking normally, seeing my friends and hanging out, etc. what I've read this doesn't sound like a typical meltdown of someone with autism, but I'm wondering if it could be a form.  feel like having an explanation to my behavior would be such a relief. I hate to be that person that's like 'oh I'm just having a moment' or whatever so If I knew that this might possibly actually be caused by something besides being emotional or whatever then I would feel so much better. yeah, just trying to get some thoughts.would this be considered a meltdown?",1633653331,2129,399

aspergers,"Hey there, so i'm self-diagnosed as Aspergers/HFA, i was given a diagnosis of Autism and ADHD when i was a toddler but my mom didn't want me to have the Autism diagnosis because of the social stigma at the time, so we went with just the ADHD diagnosis. When i became an adult and looked more into Autism, Aspergers/HFA specifically, it definitely resonates with me a lot more than mere ADHD does, and i'm pretty dang certain i have Aspergers.  question is, how is the official diagnosis process? I only have medicaid as insurance and am on I for disability (however currently under a review and need to see a doctor to document my issues and hopefully see if i can get an Autism diagnosis) and so i'm not sure exactly who to see about it, or how the process goes. My only concern is that because from outward appearance you probably wouldn't know or be able to tell i have Autism but internally i can feel the Autism and have had issues that line up with Autism all my life, so i'm concerned that even though i struggle with my Autistic-related issues, that it may be seen as too mild and thus i may not be able to get properly diagnosed. I've also been through quite the Psychedelic experimentation (Ayahuasca, primarily) which may have ""corrected"", ""some"", of my issues, but no doubt the Autism is still there.  just wanna make sure that i can get properly diagnosed and that a therapist or psychologist or whoever won't just blow off my issues and not take me seriously.  haven't seen doctors in a long time (like over 10 years) because  gave up on the psychiatric meds that they used to have me on and have been trying to treat/manage my issues over the last 10 years. Another thing is, i don't know how much of my past medical records (from when i was a kid/teen) are still around/available, and so i may have to start from scratch in terms of getting my issues documented and getting properly diagnosed.  advice is appreciated, :)Aspergers/HFA (autism) official diagnosis?",1633641006,1978,354

If we like organizing things, or collecting, and thinking in different ways then there is only one thing to do. is to embrace our strengths and find creative ways to put them to use!

aspergers," abilities of animals alone should blow your mind and give you the understanding that there are some possibilities that are beyond your comprehension.  example, smells. Animals in the wild, many of them have very sensitive, highly developed senses of smell. Many animals have a sense of smell that goes beyond human comprehension. cientists know that there are smells that are not picked up by any device. Pheromones is one of these all human beings emit a fragrance called pheromones and if you don't know it's a sexual attractant smell. It's also in the wild.  you can't detect it with your nose. But on a subconscious level, your body does and chemically reacts to this. o these things that our eyes cannot pick up do exist. Especially spiritual energy. one. These are things for you to consider by the way. You don't have to 100% believe it, for different reasons. That's perfectly, okay. You don't have to believe and I say you don't have to 100% concur with anything I say just consider it as an opinion. ome of you this will resonate with and say: this answers many of my questions now I get it. But it doesn't matter. You can still get the benefits from this material, whether you 100% believe this or not. two should you try to understand completely? Not necessarily. Think about when you get a brand new car. Do you understand how the combustion engine works? Do you understand how the ignition works? Maybe you have a general idea, but do you really know how it all works? No, but do you still drive your car and get the benefits of your car? Yes. can't completely explain many of these spiritual occurences reported around the world but it's there and it's real. If you understand that the possibility of what I'm talking about is real, that will help you. You don't have to believe everything I say, but you could say that's a possibility.  our birth, how we normally and automatically use this energy is hidden from us. Eventually we get a preview of it. Unfortunately, since we are not taught how to recognize it, we don't even know what is happening. I want you to think about how a simple thought can give you goosebumps all over your body. Your whole physiology will change for a couple of seconds even minutes by raising the hair all over your body thanks to a simple thought! 9 years of study and experience I've discovered over 10+ mind-blowing spiritual abilities that can be activated with your spiritual energy. Many of these abilities are out there already but they all miss this crucial ingredient to be constant with them and consciously control them. call this energy ""piritual chills"" (energy under your goosebumps which can be summoned with any goosebumps but recognizing it there first is a great start.) which goes by many different names like Euphoria, Voluntary goosebumps, Ecstasy, Prana, Chi, Qi, Vayus, Aura, Mana, Life force, Pitī, Rapture, Ruah, Ether, Nephesch, Chills, Goosebumps, The Force and many more.

aspergers,"Ive had severe anger issues since i was a child. When i get angry, i need to break things, shout, punch doors.I can feel the anger in my heartbeat, i feel tingling in my arms,etc. o i fully experience it. The feeling is there. However, ive noticed, that during the episode i kind of enjoy staring at the other person like intimidation i guess. I always stop mid anger rage just to stare at the person im shouting at. Any small thing can set me off. I got so extremely angry this morning because my father didnt want to call his doctor, and i had to. My life is quite tiring, the last two years im the sole carer for my ill father, so it gets intense. But i got so angry i broke his water bottle and a chair. Ive seen many psychiatrists for my anger, but none was able to help. They couldnt agree if its 'aspergers' anger, or a personality disorder or both or none. Whenever i discuss my outbursts with them, they usually just smile or even laugh. They cant understand/believe perhaps, how intense i can be. o, i just wanted to post this and see if you guys experience such intense anger rages and your thought processes?anger issues",1633603319,1132,213

aspergers,"I hate traveling. I'm very introverted and usually find myself uncomfortable interacting with strangers. I can often mask well enough in small every day social interactions but especially if I'm traveling, I feel so drained and irritated that I have a hard time getting along.   left to my own devices I wouldn't travel at all but my wife loves to. Basically every trip I've ever gone on (besides work trips) was because she wanted to go somewhere. Occasionally I've enjoyed parts of these vacations but as a whole I feel like I would just rather not do it.    wife was feeling stressed about her job last week so I suggested an impromptu stay, somewhere locally for a couple of days the following week. I thought a staycation might mitigate some of the issues I experience when traveling. I was very wrong. The things that stress me out were actually worse because I couldn't stop thinking about how easily my discomfort could end by simply going home. Eventually that's what I suggested and what we did. We left a day early from the room we paid for because I was so unhappy.  I feel like I learned a hard lesson for the last time. I don't like traveling and I'm not going to try and do it for my wife anymore. It isn't fun for her either if it's so obvious how unhappy I am. I would rather she go without me, or decide she doesn't want to travel alone. I don't see the point any more in trying to make her happy by doing something that so clearly makes me unhappy.    lay it on me. Am I wrong? hould I try again to learn to cope with the thing I hate? Or is this a more realistic decision? hould I just respect my own feelings and limitations and allow myself to be a person who doesn't travel?

aspergers,"With autism, we have poor working memory. We have poor executive functioning. This is just like ADHD. Many of us also have ADHD. is a one-way condition. We often talk too long in one direction. This is just like ADHD. Many of us also have ADHD. with autism, is about doing things, in order to do them. can be described as a ""trial and error"" condition. example, by all means try to narrow things down in your head somewhat, before trying something. you have to realise, that there is an ""infinite spam"" to ""checking"" behaviour. want you to try each day, to get out of ""checking"" behaviour. you can, just do something, rather than overthinking it. is something called dopamine. Dopamine rewards you for doing something. But if you prolong doing something, you don't get your dopamine. quicker you do something, the more you get dopamine. is very similar to sugar. You eat sugar, you get a high, then you get a low. Then you need more sugar, to keep up the sugar levels. is why sugar is so addictive. Because you get a high, then it drops, then you need to up your high again. is actually, amazingly, boosted itself, simply by eating table sugar. Table sugar is a great source of dopamine. but see, exercising causes dopamine.  a task in your head and then carrying it out causes dopamine. brain is not stupid. You cannot ""fake"" doing a task. Doing a task is something that is fundamentally outgoing and extroverted, and ""connecting"" out into the world. task, the definition, must be a task which interacts with the world.  you take a shower, this is a task inside of your own house, so you could call it ""introverted"". But it's not, because having a shower then makes you smell good in front of others. Thus, it is building towards being more ""extroverted"", because now you won't smell bad around others. knowledge is ""extroverted"". Whereas, going over old traumas or memories in your behaviour is ""introverted"". we have the concept of ""forgetting"" things. For example, reading a sentence once, doesn't necessarily mean you remember it. ometimes you do. ometimes you don't. for example, instead of keeping a list of which things you have already read, you would just read it over again, and you can tell on the spot, whether you remember it, based on whether you remember it! No need to have a ""bookmark"" of where you ""got up to"". Because you either remember it or you don't! is very easy to create fake introverted dopamine. Because, if you were in an abusive situation, then even checking out for a narcissist footsteps, and phew, the coast is clear, except, you didn't do that. The narcissist did that on their own whim. The only thing you can ever do with an abusive person is leave them. Reserve your dopamine and energy for tasks where you are not being held down by others. Being held down in the workplace is different, because at least your abusive boss is paying you a salary. autism, we are being confused as to what is a task and what is an introverted repeating ""checking"" behaviour. back to the original point, you must do things to do things, because we are awful at thinking things through.  example, let's say you had 3 tasks today. Go to the dentist2. Go to the grocery store3. Post off your letter in the post and you wake up in the morning. And of course, we have problems with autism and sleep. And we are not quite sharp in the morning. OK, a big protein breakfast and caffeine helps with that. which of these tasks do you do first? And in fact, what if you don't have the 3 tasks written down in a notepad? in fact, what you do today, is you do the very first plausible task, that you can think of. out of the 3 things above, the only once that you remember is the letter in the post. OK, great, do that. but if you were to think of the other 3 tasks, then maybe you could do the journey more efficiently and save time...?! Because you never get things done efficiently the first time!! first time you do something with autism, you are always going to screw it up! The best way to not screw it up the 2nd time, is to, as quickly as possible, attempt it the 1st time. quicker you do it the first time, the quicker you can improve on it the second time if you had remembered the grocery store, then maybe you saved time. Maybe you are on the way to posting the letter, and you remember, oh crap! I forgot the grocery store! OK, but see ,at least you got the letter done! crucially, at least you got the dopamine high, of achieving the letter thing! anybody here have parents, who told them, when they attempted to do something, that no!! you are doing it wrong!! do it my way!! watch me doing it!! check me doing it!! ""checking"" behaviour .check ,check, check. of us probably had autistic parents, and thus, they got us into this checking behaviour of them, because they were so erratic and controlling. this is confusing to us, because the workplace is controlling, autistic, narcissistic. In that sense, we have an advantage in the workplace, if we know these tricks. OK, but in your own life, you have to discover new things, by doing it by ""trial and error"". to summarise.... Just do the first plausible thing that comes to mind. by the way.. do it QUICKLY, because if we deliberate on it, then we are going to slow down. great example would be taking a cold bath. With autism, you should never take warm baths, unless you have some medical reason for doing so. Autism is a condition like ADHD, that benefits from the equivalent of ""a slap to the face"" or ""a cold of ice cold bucket water"" as the treatment. You should get in the bath as quickly as possible, wash yourself as quickly as possible, and get out. the exact same structure with every single task. You are supposed to do it quickly, rather than moving on. perfectionism as a big box. And inside is a smaller inner box.  need to be inside of this smaller box, rather than the bigger one.With autism, you must do things, to do things.",1633589187,5917,1079
aspergers,"Been seeing someone lately, and as a person on the spectrum who has learned to mask fairly well and force myself to make eye contact, I've noticed my new beau seems to have a really hard time making and holding eye contact for longer than .01 seconds.

I know I'm autistic, but haven't told them yet as the relationship is still very new and I've had heartbreaking experiences outing myself before -- so I'm waiting to see if this will become serious enough to trust them enough to expose that info about myself. But I've been wondering if they're autistic because of various similarities we have. I'm wondering if it would be socially acceptable to just ask them if they're autistic, or if that would be considered a social faux pas and potentially deeply offend them. Any advice?

aspergers,"I contemplated briefly whether to put this in the pider-Man subreddit or the Aspergers subreddit and I ultimately chose to do it here because I figured I'd get flak on the pider-Man subreddit for venting about personal issues. this post will contain spoilers for pider-Man Far From Home. You have been warned. love Marvel. I love the Marvel universe. And I'm a big fan of the MCU.  DAMN is it hard to be an MCU pider-Man fan right now... here's the TLDR if you're either uninterested in the MCU and you don't wanna read the full context. You ever have a series you love and you get frustrated because the people behind it take the option that pushes their own agenda rather than what's best for the stories or the fans? That's the thing I'm worried about with pider-Man and it's driving me crazy. And I'm feeling alone because no one is giving me a lot of sympathy for it. gonna be clear about something, I HATED the way Far From Home ended. I loved the whole film up until that mid-credit scene where Mysterio doxxes Peter and exposes his identity to the world. To me, it was ruining Peter's life with no way to restore it and a betrayal of everything pider-Man was about. If you expose his identity and frame him it ruins a lot of the appeal of pider-Man to me. But I was still confident that Marvel tudios had a plan and they'd solve this. then the deal between ony and Disney fell apart. know it's just a movie, I know it's not real, I know it's not important in the grand scheme of life....but that broke me. It was the first time I ever felt broken. I felt hollow, bitter, and angry, I just wanted to lash out at the world. They took pider-Man from me! How could they!? I felt like I lost a close friend forever. I felt like Jess at the end of Bridge to Terabithia. and Disney eventually made up and we're getting a third film but...it still didn't make me feel much better...because there was still the hanging question of ""How are they gonna resolve Far From Home's cliffhanger""? as the build-up to No Way Home has increased my enthusiasm has warned, more...and more... a lot of sources seem to be indicating this is probably ""The Last Tom Holland pider-Man film"". But that's not the worse part of me. The worst part is a theory an acquaintance of mine made. He speculated that one possible thing they could do is have Peter and his supporting cast transplanted from the MCU to the Venom universe. And I'd HATE if they did that! It'd ruin the MCU for me! I could at least pretend Peter was still in the MCU otherwise but if they have Peter, LITERALLY taken out of the MCU, well then that's it. No more hope. He really will be gone forever. And the fact the movie is tied heavily to the multiverse is just adding more fuel to the fire.  know in all likelihood they won't do that because it'd be a huge middle finger to the fanbase and would lock them out of more money-making opportunities but if I've learned anything, it's that ony and Disney don't give a shit about the fans. They're gonna push their own agenda. Because fuck the fans! We want money!  so...nervous...agitated...I just don't wanna have to bury another Peter Parker. I don't even care if it's the last time I see Tom Holland as pider-Man. I just want him to literally stay in the MCU. Then even if it's he not ""Officially"" in the MCU I can at least pretend! It's ruining my attachment to the MCU because I'm scared of getting attached. I don't want to watch the MCU anymore if Peter isn't around. one I know gets it. No one I know gets what I'm trying to say. I got one friend who comes close but he's mostly indifferent because unlike me he knows it's not worth it to get worked up over non-issues(Lucky him). got another friend who REALLY doesn't get it. he says ""I didn't quit the MCU when Tony died"" but that's not the same thing! Tony died as part of a character arc, This would be Peter LITERALLY taken out of the MCU. As in physically not in it. o he doesn't get it. the worse is this one friend who's super excited. He's made peace with the fact that Peter could be taken out of the MCU literally and is completely apathetic to my pain. He doesn't get where I'm coming from at all and seems to resent me for even thinking this way. know I shouldn't feel this way. It's just a fictional character. It's a non-issue. I don't need the MCU to be happy. I don't need the MCU to live a full life, I have other stuff that makes me happy and fulfilled. And even if pider-Man is taken out of the MCU I'll always have the original comics where I know he'll never leave. why do I feel this way? Why am I so worked up over this? Why can't I let it go? Why does nobody just say ""Yes Tom. I understand why you feel the way you do and I feel a similar way. Giving up the MCU is okay."" just feel...alone.Airing my frustrations about MCU Spider-Man and how it's personally affecting me. Why do I feel this way? PLEASE.

I had posted to /r/ADHD but thought I would post here as well.  the last few days I've been watching, ""Love On The pectrum,"" a Netflix show about people with Autism entering the dating world. One woman on the show has high functioning Autism - I guess that would be Asperger's? I can definitely relate to how she describes her Autism. But at the same time, I know that ADHD can have very similar symptoms.  was tested for all sorts of disabilities when I was younger. I was diagnosed with ADHD, dyslexia, dysgraphia, and dyscalculia.  This was in the mid-90's when it felt like nearly everyone was being diagnosed with ADHD. But I also feel like Autism wasn't nearly as well understood then and maybe it's possible I either wasn't tested, the tests weren't interpreted properly, or maybe I was diagnosed but never told?   it's more likely that I have ADHD and happen to share some symptoms with high functioning Autism. But the similarities between myself and this person on the Netflix show are definitely noteworthy to me. o naturally, I went to the internet for answers.  definitely don't have all of the symptoms but I feel as though my ADHD may help to mask some of them. I think I pass as an NT - but with minor quirks that most people would probably just chock up to being eccentric. While I can hold a conversation and can be social, I also feel the need to be alone and recharge my batteries. In the past I've referred to myself as a good mix of introvert and extrovert. I find myself over analyzing my social interactions, replaying them in my head for a while afterward, and critiquing them. I find it hard to look people in the eye during a conversation and make a conscious effort to do so. For years I've told my wife that for my whole life I've just felt ""different"" from everyone else.  some ways I don't think I am on the spectrum because I feel like I don't fit some of the key symptoms to a T. I guess I also always associated Autism with something that's not...me. For instance, I had friends and coworkers on the spectrum. To me, it was noticable that they acted different differently than NT's. o I guess, beyond my ADHD, I never considered myself to be all that far frOM NT...

But as things tend to do, they came to a head Friday night. He has been working a ton- like unreasonable to ask of anyone, truly- and he is suffering pretty severely. I have been dealing with my own pretty heavy stuff and, in the weakest moment of my life, I ended up projecting my insecurities, assumed his intentions, and overall just blew up on him. We both kind of broke down after that and I could see the raw hurt in his eyes, and he kept apologizing and telling me he is doing his best (which he absolutely is trying so hard). I apologized profusely, and regardless of what angle you take, I was admittedly 100% out of line. I am thoroughly disgusted with myself. spent aturday and most of unday crying uncontrollably (while trying to shelter him from it because that is not his to give one single shirt about PLU he needs space alone) because how could I be so stupid and forking selfish?? And then it forking clicked. He said something that made it click. said that he's forking re\*\*\*\*ed  out of hurt/anger. mentioned in the past notions or thoughts pointing toward thinking he is/being on the autistic scale, but never ended up getting tested. He was also ""raised"" (think more ""left to survive, or not"") away from society, endured severe misfortunes and outright abuses, the likes of which I've never heard remotely close to, which, as I'm sure you all know, essentially obliterates any opportunity for actual growth or understanding. He has been through and overcome so goddamn much.  I looked up Asperger's. ...so many mixed emotions. I am trying to get past my stupid selfish self loathing so that I can try to bring it up to him in an emotionless as possible way but after looking back at how fucking blind I have been and considering I've apparently been using a fucking cheez-it for a brain, how am I supposed to even bring this up? I think it could help him immensely- but he is also going through what appears to be autistic burnout, and has been for a while. It's getting progressively worse.  spending literally an entire night and day obsessively researching and reading studies and scholarly articles and finding and checking what I gather to be the facts and sciences behind it... I am convinced he has it. I don't want to bring this up in any way that could portray that in a negative light, but he's in a negative place. I just want to help, and so many of these things align with feelings he's expressed and thoughts he's had, experiences he's told me about, things he's shared with me... and looking back, I can see how much it explains and how much I misinterpreted. He really opened up (he doesn't do that )in an attempt to show me a pure true love from his heart. And I did probably one of the worst things I could have. Things make so much more sense now, and I feel an outright fool, and severely unworthy of any love, namely his. Also, what if I'm misreading again, and I actually just explode the earth. I truly believe he could benefit so much from consideration of it, at least. only idea I've got so far is to write him a letter, with the opening telling him how loved he is and some of his strengths and things that make him smile. I have gathered links and stuff (sources, if you will) that directly address some of the more specific thoughts/feelings he's expressed to me. I thought about additionally mentioning that he'd thought himself to be on the scale in the past, while also suggesting that it might be worth revisiting. Even in the instance he disagrees with the thought, he tends to be science and fact based. It may not \*be\* the same, but perhaps if the symptoms or aspects are similar, some of the same or similar coping skills and strategies could offer help or respite for what he's going through, or point him in some direction. I even thought it would be cute and personal to him if I ""cite my sources"" where I found especially supporting links to some of his experiences.  I would give it to him and at the end, reiterate that I understand the need for time to process or think or be alone or whatever he feels, and that I will be here for him if/when he wants to talk. I kind of want to leave it at that as to not imply expectation of response. The point is for him to have it and me to just help/be there if he wants it. Ideally, I'd give it to him when he has time available to be free to do whatever he feels during/after he reads it. I understand that it will most likely be a sensitive subject, deserving of respect and compassion. However, like I said, he isn't doing well and it's getting worse. He is scared and confused because he doesn't understand what's going on. He isn't unintelligent or unaware of himself typically, in fact quite the opposite. He is breaking down trying to live up to expectations set for a NT society, is ultra high functioning, and regularly expresses anger and frustration at being different and not understanding people or why they think the things they do. If it's going to help him, it's kind of time-sensitive.   I truly do love this amazing and patient man with my whole dumb heart and cheez it brain. I truly do just want to help and support him as best I can. I consciously try to own up to my shortcomings and take responsibility for my offending thoughts/actions/words/existence as soon as I become aware of them and express that to him. I can and have helped him feel better understood in the past (not with this, obviously)... but I have also just delivered a careless and scathing blow while he was already trying with everything he had. Unintentional, but devastating all the same... the fork do I do?I desperately need advice on how to not fork this up.",1633572867,6381,1160

Anytime my friends would want to go to the mall or hang out I wanted to go to. o I went all the way until this summer living my life never thinking about my autism at all, I also had an I have an IEP in school that I only use for math. I’m 17 and I got contacts in august. I’ve always had shit vision and hated wearing glasses so my mom finally got my contacts. It was amazing at first and I really liked it. But I feel like my mental health since then has gone down horribly. I started in person school around that time to, now I don’t think school is the cause because my grades are fine as they are right now and I still have all my friends from the last time I did in person school. But man idk how to describe it every thing Is just so awkward now, and it’s hard to talk sometimes, I should get into my main point. You all know a common symptom of AD is to avoid or try to have at least eye contact as possible right? Well my vision back then is just absolutely awful so looking at people was never an issue. Now it’s kind of uh well I can do it and not make a big issue out of it but it can kind of be annoying sometimes but I really think something in my brain is changing with all this new input. I feel like I’m a completely different person now than I was before my contacts. I’m considering to stop using them and carry around my glasses instead for when I really need them.

I don't want sympathy points for something I've been able to work around all my life. Even though it affects my job, I feel like I still do it pretty well. But, I just think that if I told her, she'd also be afraid to be transparent with me about how she feels if I were to make a mistake. I'm not looking for any advice, because I know what the right thing to do is anyway, but I just wish people understood so that way I wouldn't have to be self-conscious about it. ometimes I even forget that I have it because I never acknowledge it until I get a little stressed out, and I want her to know that it's not affecting my life too badly, but that I might be unaware that some of the stuff I say/do could be interpreted differently than I mean it to. I'd also like to point out that I like to be quite expressive when I talk to the kids and have energy to go along with my actions, so don't think I'm saying that everything I do and say is related to my Asperger's.

aspergers," The black mirror episode U Callister may be the most explicit anti autist people piece of media I've ever had the misfortune of being exposed to.  It is a story about how a socially awkward person who is clearly coded as autistic takes revenge against his abusive coworkers by trapping clones of their minds, a simulated tar Trek knockoff.  The implications of the story are clear and explicit, people who display signs of autism are all secretly sadistic creeps who deserve to be abused by society.  The worst part about the fact that he is socially awkward around women being an indicator of wanting to sexualy exploit his female coworkers.  This is not an uncommon way autistic people are attacked, with the fact that we can have trouble navigating our confusing feeling regarding sex being used to portray us as predators.  Portraying a marginalized community as sexual predators is the oldest trick in the bigot playbook.  If a similar story was written by white people about a black person who is subject to low level discrimination and emotional abuse by his white coworkers and then suggesting that he has a secret yearning for revenge that include sexualy abusing his female coworkers and murdering children then it would rightfully be called out for being racist.  o why is the same plot but demonizing autistic people one of the most popular episodes in a popular TV show?

aspergers,"To preface, I realize a large part of the problem probably comes from me, but Idk how to exactly function in this situation.  a female college student and I don’t have many friends, especially female ones, so when it came to housing I signed a lease with 3 other females who I didn’t know before. I think 2 of them were friends already and me and another girl were strangers to them. After living together I realize the other 3 are all outgoing and extroverted. The one other girl is already good friends with the other two. At the beginning, I tried talking to them and joining on their group conversations, but I realized I don’t really like talking to them, because their common interests and mine just don’t overlap that much. Also, during the day, I enjoy being all by myself in my room and don’t really come out of my room unless for necessities, like food or bathroom, while they would hang out with each other in the living room all the time pretty much right after school.  this has resulted is a strange cycle where everyday the other 3 girls would hang out together in the living room and eat or cook together. They would talk loudly for hours together, so I have to wear headphones to do my school work and have alone time (my room is right next to the living room so the sound travels pretty loud here…), because I really don’t like any noise except for music when I’m alone. Like for some reason I can’t stand hearing them talk all the time, especially if they start laughing or exclaiming/acting surprised during conversations. Meanwhile I pretty much stay in my room the entire evening after I get back from school. Their conversations get more exclusive, like gossiping about other people, so I don’t feel comfortable joining them. They’re still nice to me and say hi to me when they see me, etc. but I can tell the room kind of shifts when I get out of my room to get food in the kitchen while they’re in there, like I’m interrupting their moment or something. This has resulted in me being more avoidant of them, I wouldn’t come out of my room to get something unless I know they’re gone.  if I should just keep going like this or try to join them somehow, but I feel like it’s too late to try and befriend them. First of all they’re not the type of people I could see myself being friends with I guess. econd I’ve overheard them already talking about signing a lease at another place together next year as a group of 3 (all 4 of us decided not to re-sign the lease for our current house as the rent here was going to increase next year)… I wasn’t planning on living with them again in another place anyway, but Idk, now that I know that they’re “secretly” not planning to live with me I don’t know why I should still try befriending them. I guess I just don’t know how to function in this house, because I don’t want to have to avoid them and inconvenience myself everyday since it is my house and I pay the rent too, but at the same time I just want to keep the interactions with them to a minimum…Should I attempt to talk with my roommates or just accept the current way of life I’m in?",1633552086,3108,583

Then almost 3 years ago I finally managed to convince myself that I need help because I'm suffering from mild to severe depression.This was confirmed by my GP and a psychiatrist who gave me an NRI and told me it would be good for me to look for a psychotherapist. o I did that and only found one who had open appointments in the foreseeable future. Almost every time I went there I cried my eyes out and tried to talk but never really felt I could get across how I was truly feeling and when I didn't cry he would ask me how I felt in a situation I was talking about and I would just think of emotions that would be expected in that scenario. o I eventually stopped going and tried to maybe talk to friends a bit about myself and stuff but also never really felt truly understood. Talking to my parents was out of the question because I felt that they and especially my father didn't know me at all even though I lived with them. Then a year ago I finally started going to University after going to Australia for a year and doing a voluntary social year after completing my Abitur (hardest of the three german secondary schools) in 2018. I attended the first semester while staying at home because everything was online anyway. In April I moved to a new city and got a shared apartment in one of the student residences. I was very lucky to have a very nice flatmate who ended up being my first kiss and first person to have sex with. Although I like her a lot I never really wanted a relationship and have been clear with her about this from the start. I sometimes think she wants a bit more but when I ask her about it she denies it so I think if she is getting hurt it's not on me. But she probably is still the person that knows me the best out of everyone I have ever known. Over the last weekend I once again thought about this autism thing and decided to do some tests. I don't remember the scores but it was almost always in the mild to ""average"" autism area. Then I took the Camouflaging Autistic Traits Questionnaire (CAT-Q) and got a result of something slightly above 140. I don't know how well that test is known but 140 is indicative of very strong camouflaging. And when I read about it it explained so so so much of my childhood behaviour and struggles in daily life. I thought and read about nothing else for the next day and the more I thought the more confident I became in my self diagnosis and while at first I felt happy about finally understanding myself a bit better I soon started crying a lot because my relationship to my parents is so bad they would probably not be very convinced. But somehow I managed to find the courage to to text my mom about it yesterday afternoon because it felt like this was how I could finally explain my thoughts. Later while I was grocery shopping I saw a missed call from my mom and texted her I would call her back when I'm home. On the way home I saw another missed call this time from my father's phone number. When I arrived at home I immediately called my mom but my dad answered and said he wanted to call me about something else and just happened to see my message. He immediately dismissed all of my thoughts apart from that I may have special interests and I just couldn't explain anything because I was constantly holding back tears, trying not to sob or snuffle and hate talking on the phone anyway. I sometimes managed to make a short passive-aggressive remark when he said something like: ""You don't really have social contact issues. Do you?"", I responded with: ""Don't I?"". After the call was over I cried even harder than before and hoped that my mom would be a bit more unterstanding. Then my flatmate came home after staying the weekend at her parents house. he is studying social work and has some psychology lectures. he understood what I was trying to say pretty fast. My mom texted me later that apart from problems with eye contact she can't really see any autistic traits in me. I couldn't sleep the whole night and eventually started to just look for some quirks of mine and see if any sudies link them to AD or the Camouflaging of it and sent them all to my mom along with a short explanation what's in them and why I think it applies to my case (they don't speak English very fluently and most of them were in English). I hope that they will take the time to at least try to understand what I feel like. For myself there probably aren't many things I've ever been this sure about but if you think I'm totally wrong don't hesitate to tell me. I don't know yet whether I will try to get diagnosed or not.o that's it I just needed to vent right now I hope I'm making a bit of sense.Need to vent",1633532743,5270,989

We have a lot in common and I felt at ease talking to them which doesn’t happen very often.Is it acceptable to just ask them to go out to a pub for drinks?I never do this sort of stuff unless I really know someone because it just feels like I’m being awkwardly pushy.

aspergers,"I don't like being inappropriate socially, but I can't help it. It feels like every few days, I say/do something really weird/off/creepy and it hurts. I hate the look on people's faces when I've done something inappropriate. About 50% of the time I realise straight away and then I feel bad and have to sit in the social situation feeling shitty, which affects my ability to continue. The other 50%, I don't realise until like 6 months to a year later and then it's this horrible ""oh my god, that was really bad. I was so rude/creepy/unacceptable"" feeling. that's just the times I actually realise. There has to be a bunch of times where I don't even realise I've done something wrong, and I'm seeing the social consequences but I don't understand why people are disliking me etc. say such stupid things sometimes and my coping mechanisms are garbage. I've never properly learned how to socialise and I feel like a child on the inside even though I'm late 20s. When someone hurts my feelings or when I say something really embarrassing, I just feel like crying because it just reminds me of how I felt as a kid, being ridiculed and ostracised and lonely etc.  feel really alone sometimes, because I can't relate to many people. I have a few people in my life that are there for me which I feel lucky for, but I hate living in the real world with all the normal people. I want to find a place where I can exist and fit in, where people don't expect me to act like a NT person. The only success I've had in that is when I isolated myself with the few people I have, didn't go to work or uni and basically just relied on other people to support me. Whenever I try to go into the real world to do something, it feels awful because I can't find anywhere I feel comfortable. I'm 2 weeks into my masters course at university and at first I felt like I was doing really well and actually making some friends, but it took a turn where I felt like I did/said some socially unacceptable things and now I feel distanced from the people I met. I feel discouraged, because I know that even after I graduate and apply for jobs, I'll just be in the same position. People will like me to the extent that I can pretend to be NT, and then when that drops, I become the extremely weird creepy person who does/says strange things and can't do their job not because I don't know how to do it, but because the instructions aren't clear enough because I require meticulously detailed instructions in order to do anything at all. sure exactly what I posted this for, just a rant I guess :(I feel like such an embarrassment all the time.

aspergers,"The only obvious one to me is when I manage to accidentally insult or compliment people when this was unintended. I shared this story earlier but some friends and friends of friends at a pub thought I was bisexual and flirting. Because I told a guy that said he wanted to lose weight down from 90kg; ""Where do you hide the other 20kg? You look super fit - like 70kg!"". It was a factual objective observation with no agenda or implication from my side. I was just genuinely surprised he weighed that much because he didn't look like it.  I didn't realize some of them could even think I was hitting on him. Happens more often with insults though.    I wasn't diagnosed until recently at the age of 36. And it took a suicide attempt and 9 months of psych eval to find out I had Asperger and ADHD. I first thought I had anti-social personality disorder, because I don't feel guilt, regret, fear or anxiety (psychopathic traits). Turned out this stemmed from my view on myself, other humans and the world through a very cold and cynical analytical lense - and not through malevolence.      Anyway. Thing is. I have no idea what behaviors, speech and acts I do is ""real"" and ""fake"". When I mask or not. What parts of me are affected by Asperger and not. And to what degree.     I don't feel like I have an actual personality. More like an amalgamation of the thousands of people I have imprinted upon myself. I don't feel like a real person. But an artificial construct that has assimilated all thoughts, opinions, body language, traits and personality from other people - having become a Frankenstein's monster that mimics life as if I was a living reliquary of different minds in a hive mind.      o what's the problem? The above also applies to NT people too no? Assuming roles as well.     I was wondering if anyone have the same feelings, or any thoughts or advice on this. How do I know what parts of me is the ""standard human operating system"" and which parts has been reprogrammed and how much?    The issue in identity crisis for me is that, I think I'm overthinking and overexaggerating Asperger compared to how much actual effect it has on making you different from an NT. But how do you even know what parts and how much is ACTUALLY Asperger - and what parts are simply the human condition and nature?My identity feels like an artificial construct. I don't know what behaviors are autism spectrum affected and not, and where they blend in. I don't know where I'm accountable or where I'm ""innocent"" in relation to social rules.",1633515512,2534,452

I’m never happy except for a week out of last year(confirmation that happiness was possible) and yesterday. know that happiness is a mental state, but it’s so hard to click into. I read this article yesterday:  do each thing on this list and was able to turn the switches to be positive and talkative. But the moment I bumped into my neighbor and said “What’s up?”, I was spiraling down again. He responded with “hey, buddy!” and it made me realize that happiness doesn’t make life better.  matter what, people will always treat you differently. He’s a nice 20 something, hard working man and I know “Hey,buddy!” is a nice thing to say. But I always notice people put up a front around me. My neighbor called me buddy, and once I walked away, he switched tones and started chatting with his friend. People are always overly nice to me when they aren’t that way with others. I will not get anywhere. I’m naive and probably gullible. is real with me and I’m always treated super sweetly before I find out that’s not really who they are. My neighbor was only an example of how people often interact with me. It woke me up to “oh, he’s not treating me like everyone else.” Being happy only increases my experience but it’s hard to keep that going.

aspergers,"Up until grade 11, I've never had to study to get at least a 75 in math. Then in grade 11, I was understanding what the teacher says and was constantly answering questions the teacher asked the class way before anybody could come up with an answer. I would also complete all the questions in the book really quickly with little effort.Then when the test comes, I have an incredibly hard time with it, and usually average a 65 percent. Its partially due to test anxiety causing me to forget a few rules, which isnt really a problem since I just logic my way through it, but then around half of the questions have some sort of twist to it that I cant understand. Is this related to problems with conceptual thinking that lots of autistic people have because were more detail oriented?, or am I just an idiot who happens to be ok at logic?Is anybody good at math but struggles with tests?",1633444998,885,164

aspergers,"Hello. I feel I've ended up in somewhat of a road block in my life. I find myself not being able to understand social connections or really emotions all that well. Let me explain. been home schooled for about 5 years since 3rd grade. I barely had any conversations with anyone and only stayed on the computer most of my life. During this time, I came off as an odd child. I did not like loud noises (absolute fear of thunderstorms, afraid of the vaccum, and couldn't stand the sound of drums at my church). At the time I also was suffering from motor ticks which thank heavens I was able to get over. I also had some speech problems.But now, we transition to middle school. started attending middle school in 2016, and it was the most confusing time of my life. I couldn't understand the social norms, barely talked, only wanted to study and understand big words, etc. I only had one sided relationships and it absolutely sucked. we transition towards high school. This is where I started learning that I act odd. People said I talked odd, acted odd, and even walked odd. This is when people started to not want to be friends with me anymore. This all had a tremendous effect on me and lead me to asking this question. seems I just can't understand relationships. I don't understand why people argue but are still friends. I don't understand why people cry sometimes. I just can't react to when people are in pain and it's frustrating. I just feel like there's something missing in the way I interact with people.

English is not my first language, and writing does not come easily to me in any language. am a 22 year-old male who was diagnosed with Aspergers at age 4, and my parents kept it hidden from until three years ago. I have for most of my life been either depressive or on therapy or sometimes both. I have no girlfriend, no friends, that is people who would want to hang out with me or even like me and I have only one person with whom I occasionally exchange memes and he lives on the other side of the Atlantic.   life seems a wreck on many levels. My social life is non-existent since I was 11, that is when I stopped interacting (e.g. playing) with others. I feel like they hate me and I dislike them. I have trouble understanding specially social cues and figurative language. They have often throughout my life derided my manners. I also have trouble expressing my opinions clearly and adjusting my vocabulary to social contact. It is not that I lack assertiveness. On the contrary, most team work I have ever done was punctuated by arguments, in which my point of view prevailed. The thing is I am totally oblivious on to how people behave and think beyond the clear acts of courtesy or distaste. I have for seven years tried to have a girlfriend and wasn’t able to have any dates. I hate myself.When I was smaller, that is until I was 12 or so, I used to be beaten up by the other boys ( they even sticked once a pencil up my butt). The girls weren’t much different on intent, to them I was always a maniac, crazy, strange, gay, wholly repulsive. They would and still do make fun of me to this day, exaggerating the I speak and behave. the other hand, the supposed advantages that Aspergers afford some people on the spectrum seem totally alien to me. I don’t have any talents whatsoever and can’t find anything I excel at. I don’t have the capacity of focus, the easiness to calculate, the talent on a given subject that savants and people on the spectrum are known for. I don’t have much talent on language, on math, on sciences and no subject seems to interest me in particular. I also don’t seem to stick to routines. Over the course of the years I have had many obsessions, but none of much use. The most consistent of which was the habit reading parts of books without much care or context, building encyclopedic knowledge on all things superficial in the field of humanities and social sciences. I was always the best history student and on the top 5 percent of my class while I was on school, but today, since i entered college, I feel like my life is meaningless and that I am piece of garbage, who could not ever contribute or amount to anything on society, I feel like my life is a toll and a burden on the lives of my loved ones. I feel like each day only is worse than the preceding and that life will be unbearable, since I haven’t made any significant progress in nothing and life gets rougher, I know most of you had it way worse, but I can’t help. I have had psychological and psychiatric treatment for years and it was to no avail.

aspergers,"o, I was studying up on the history of AD/Asperger's and how it was once considered a form of schizophrenia.  This of course led me to read more about schizophrenia and realize just how close these conditions actually are.  I think in my mind ""schizophrenia"" meant the extreme cases -- which is exactly the kind of thinking that led me to dismiss Aspergers relating to myself and my children for years. I would like to know - does anyone else have ""delusions""?  Are they delusions if you don't believe in them yet they persist?  Does that mean I *believe* them on some level? list some of mine: delusion -- something is wrong, diseased of abnormal with the body.  I never wanted X-rays or blood taken because of feelings that ""something is wrong"" with me and it would be discovered.  I was very surprised that I bore two healthy, perfect children. delusion -- belief that one does not exist.  For me this goes along with the somatic delusion.  I'm not Real, not a Real Person.  I'm a robot or fictional character or some such.  I've heard of other Aspies feeling something like this -- being *other* than regular people.  My son has also had feelings like this. of mind being read -- other people can know one's thoughts.  Big for me.  I've felt like I'm on display, going through some kind of story.  My thoughts, motivations, etc are being broadcast and analyzed by whatever powers-that-be. of guilt/sin.  I've done (thought) something terrible.  I do (think) terrible things.  And everyone knows! of control -- thoughts and behaviors are controlled by another.  ort of.  This is my intrusive thoughts, my OCD.  Not being controlled per se, but these horrible, bizarre thoughts come unbidden and I can't make them stop. is the stuff that is floating around in the back of my head.  Like I said, I can rationalize that this is all ""in my head"" but the feelings remain. strikes me as particularly odd is in all this I seem to feel/acknowledge a lot of other, outside thought processes, other *minds*.  One hallmark of autism is poor ""Theory of Mind"" - the idea that other people have ""minds"" just as our own -- that they have separate thoughts and feelings, which is what creates empathy in NTs.  This is, supposedly, what leads people to a belief in god.  That there is a deity with a mind, a presence, that one can have a connection to.  And in that case it makes sense because I am an unquestioning atheist who can't wrap my head around intelligent people believing in such things.  Yet here I have delusions that my thoughts are somehow readable by a higher intelligence.  I mean, WTF? I've gong off track once again.  I like being able to ""unmask"" my Aspie-ness here, yet at the same time I am ""masking"" by using a separate Reddit account unconnected with the rest of my life -- hahaha!  delusions -- do you have them?DAE have delusions?",1633379217,2842,501

I started to cry and I could only say ""it's the noise, it hurts, make it stop"" and then he took me to the back of the kitchen and he told me ""stay here, calm down, now I'll be back"" and I stayed there trying to control myself and then The screams fell silent and I could breathe again, my mother came back and hugged me saying ""that's it, there's no noise, calm down, I took them out, they're gone"" so I calm down, drinking water, and my sister and my cousin appeared by the door asking what had happened, and my mother explained to them and they hugged me saying that everything was fine and that I was going to scold those girls for their screaming. My mother later asked me if she had taken my medicine in the morning, I answered yes, and she wondered how loud the cry had been to upset me like that. the end, I took a bath to calm down more, the headache went down but it continued and it turns out that the scream had come from my niece, just because my little sister had taken a book from her and my niece started screaming and throwing a tantrum, scaring everyone and they stopped what they were doing to go see them and my cousin had left because he could not bear the screams and he found me on the living room floor making small noises of complaints made into a ball, holding my hatreds tightly with his hands.

aspergers,"this may not be AD as much as personality and anxiety. I find that I can get easily overwhelmed and find it difficult to think clearly enough when confronted. I also have ADHD which creates difficulty with memory and properly engaging. in hindsight, I could formulate some points that could've been said but by then it's a bit late. failing so many times to properly self-advocate in the face of challenges by others has compounded and led me to ruminate a lot on this. I could say that I am petty in that regard and haven't been able to shake it. I suppose I don't like the idea of getting verbally beaten down without offering much resistance. I admit that it has also lead to a bruised ego and irritable feeling.  suppose naturally being more agreeable and avoidant of conflict has left me blind to ways of argumentation. I could view the comment section anywhere on the web and pick up certain styles and phrases but nothing that really coincides with how I'd go about it. many other elements like depression, low self-esteem, and doubt put me on the fence. usually left unsure about the arguments I could make. I suppose that makes me weak and without single-mindedness and congruency, I essentially sabotage my own position.  other little details get in the way as well like being afraid to appear pettier than I already am by bringing up an old argument or making a comment on the other person's behavior, hypocrisy or mentality. I try to reason with myself and try to instill a sense of stoicism about all of it. try not to let past encounters get to my head too much. though I find rejection sensitivity usually gets the better of me leading me to personalize and internalize quite a bit. giving weight to other people's words and opinions over my own.  don't believe I adequately covered this in a clear or articulate enough manner.

I was initially very dismayed when I heard the mask mandates were coming back but I see a lot of people are not following them in several little ways and they don't point it out to each other. I believe masks work but since so many people around me (college in Chicago) are vaccinated and young and from looking at the stats on the CDC's own website I can't justify rigid adherence to the rule to myself since the risk to those around me and myself is so low. go to college and in each class there are a few students (myself included) with their masks under their nose. I know some other students are somewhat bothered by this because I've overheard that they are in one conversation. I only heard this once though so if most people are bothered by this they don't regularly voice this. In addition some professors even teach with the mask under their nose.  eating in the cafeteria you can take the mask off to eat even though last year when the pandemic broke out they closed down the commons. When studying, some people take off their masks. When it's someone's private room who's not in their pod people take off their mask. When no authority figures are around, those who want to take off their masks do, and those who keep them on don't tattle. guess is that trust and one's own adherance to rules and authority might be factors here.

aspergers,"A huge chunk of NTs care so much about 'making something out of themselves' and having 'status', concepts which almost define the typical adult NT yet are completely alien to my autistic brain. I can understand wanting enough money to buy enough food for a month, to cover bills, to be able to indulge in hobbies that cost money (fortunately most of my hobbies are free; from what I've seen most truly expensive hobbies are more of a flex than anything) and having a few *quality* friends (to some, having lots of friends in addition to having lots of money adds to your 'status'). But why try and earn beyond and above what you actually need and climbing high up the social ladder? My mind doesn't understand it and never has. I just have no drive to seek out 'success' like most NTs do and place way more value in time than in earning giant paychecks, becoming popular / famous or owning a huge home. Many would perceive my lack of desiring these things as flaws and would deem me lazy, but that wouldn't be quite accurate. I just feel that, ultimately, time and freedom matter way more than 'status', which I consider to be meaningless. it that NTs, deep down inside, hope that in achieving these things it'll allow them to be remembered eternally? If so, that's a futile, unrealistic, egotistical endeavor as even the most famous people of today will be forgotten with the passage of time—some even within 100 years. like some NTs, but their priorities confuse the hell out of me.Does anyone else not get the concepts of 'making something out of yourself' and 'status'?

I effectively had no choice but to deal with it and 'understand' his bs.  small things he does triggers me; e.g. fast gestures, raised voice. I also dont trust a thing he says, especially as he TILL lies to our mum about again, silly small things. I try my best to put this shit aside as I live alone anyway, so I only see him once or twice a week. But that's all it takes. the other night playing Uno with my mum and her boyfriend and the brother. I'm fairly sure he cheats immediately; whatever. I've learnt it's better to just ignore stuff like this sometimes, it's not worth the inevitable arguement if I did bring it up. I'm kinda good at Uno, so a few won games in he accuses me of cheating to which I respond, only cheaters accuse others of cheating and he makes some comment about 'challenging' me (a bs rule we've never played before, something hes done in the past which basically resulted in us banning games we could play as a family). was annoyed but I shut up. I made my own way home rather than taking the lift from him because I didnt want an arguement. I briefly spoke to my mum who said she hadnt heard the comments and I reminded her it's the same bs he would pull 10 years ago to purposely stir shit (I absolutely beleive some of his behaviour was enabled growing up, and let's not go there about how I feel that my parents didnt protect me). messaged him to let him know why I was pissed and that I'm sick of his petty comments over a GAME. To which he responded, in summary 'I was joking but you're still figuring your AD out I've had 20 years to learn so it's okay!' And I'm fucking RAGING. dare he bring my new diagnosis into a situation where we ALL know he's potentially going to cheat anyway, that's part of the game if you play with him. But more so, I choose O OFTEN to shut up and not cause an arguement and then he has the balls to accuse me, make up some bs about looking at my cards, and then use my diagnosis to try and excuse it as a 'joke' and to add to that, the condescending way the message read. only thing I can agree with is yeah, hes had 20+ years of figuring out how to navigate this world with his condition, and I just got to collect trauma upon trauma.

Well, I relate to this a lot, but here's the thing, I've barely even 'achieved' anything in life.  Not only this but I actively discourage myself from trying to become too successful in any area.  Because what my subconscious feeling is, ""That's not my place.""  ""It's not my place to be exceptional""  It actually **discourages** me from becoming too good at something that would earn most people some type of respect and recognition.  When I work(ed) at the grocery store, I deliberately kept myself from trying hard enough to move up the ranks and stayed in the entry position.     applies to relationship type stuff too.  If I had ever gotten tipped off that someone liked me, I immediately would feel ashamed for existing and messing up the 'natural order' of things.  ""*You're not supposed to be loved by any woman, you're supposed to keep to yourself and leave everyone else alone*"" is my internalization.  I could only imagine that had I ever tried to date someone, I would just be in a constant mentality of knowing that I don't really deserve her, which ends up stunting me from expressing myself, and causing her to reject me, emotionally, which would just cause a vicious cycle where things just keep spiraling until one of us just decides to cut it off.   could only assume this is largely a C-PTD thing mixed with elements of Imposter yndrome.

If the house burns down, its everyone in adgacent buildings who's impacted, not just the kid playing with matches. other ways, the level of selection can be even smaller than the individual, like when commercial entities sell addictive experiences and also addiction recovery services. ""Conflicts of interest"" don't always apply to corporate legal entities, not if there is money to be made. stuff all comes rushing into my head as I read about people's struggles here to find a nourishing way to engage with others. I don't hold with social darwinism at all, it's hogwash - but it's also at the center of many neurotypical's thinking when they decide whether or not being seen in our company will enhance their social status. I find myself rejecting an entire group of people at once, when I see individuals mistreat other individuals in the group, and it goes seemingly unnoticed. being part of a group can certainly hurt my chances of survival, and so too belonging to the wrong kind of group can be even more dangerous than going it alone.

I was pushing carts for Walmart, so i never had a lot of interaction with people, but i could feel my self getting more and more tired and angry the more i worked there and i didn’t like it. ( i think the mangers knew i was “different” and purposely put me to work outside, i applied for the front desk :(  i’ve been having problems finding a new job and actually holding it down. It feels like i always start off super strong. Manage to get an interview, ace it, start working, things are going fine, then boom. Exhaustion.

Maybe it was just the jobs, but i feel like it wont matter where i work.

But i was dreading coming back in after a not even a week. Is this normal?  feel like people don’t understand how difficult it is. Like i see everyone else working and i want to, but i cant explain the feeling of just tiredness and emptiness, maybe its because i know i HAVE to be there and I’m FORCED to work to get my money, which is clearly how the world works.

aspergers,"Last year my father's health deteriorated and i couldnt cope with it, so i decided to seek help. I am in my 30s. I am in a country where psychiatrists are not that great..they dont see many cases because mental health carries a stigma here. Ive changed quite a few, and they all see me differently. My diagnoses vary. ome diagnosed me with autism, some with a personality disorder. Which is a joke, but nevermind.. I would like to discuss some of my thought processes with you all, and see if anyone relates?    general i have a huge distrust towards the human kind. I remember that since i was a child i observed humans. When i was 7 my classmate broke her arm at school and everyone ran to her to see if shes fine, to call for the teachers etc. But i was the only one not participating. In general i didnt participate in anything. And my thought process behind this was that it was just an arm. ince hundreds of kids went to her, it wont make any difference if i go as well. But even if i went my reaction would be forced. I dont react when someone gets hurt around me. If its a stranger i dont care, if its my parents its still awkward, i usually call my other parent to help. I cognitively understand they are hurting, but i cant feel the compassion or the necessity to help. I have extreme anger issues, i punch doors, walls, i sometimes have threatened people. Mostly relatives cos i know i can get away with it, but my neighbors as well when they play loud music for example. It gets out of control. When i go to work outings, i am the silent one. I just observe, i dont feel very at ease when im with people i dont know well. I usually start to think..does this person look happy, does it look like someone i can talk to. I observe them for a bit before i start talking and then my mind overthinks...did they like my joke, do their eyes show happiness can i continue or should i stop. But i can also go the other way if i dont like the people or didnt get my daily adrenaline joke, and try to decipher them to see if i can pick on them.  anyway, wanted to share these patterns thoughts with you because im pretty sure you guys are much better in identifying behaviours than my psychiatrists who have no idea what autism is.Thought processes",1633175652,2248,429

This is the type of thing that would usually scare me a lot, but I know and love the subject very much, and more than that, my advisor pulled out all the stops to get me teachers who I have worked with a lot, and who can understand my odd speech and thinking process. Two of the faculty members are really the people I love best and trust most in world, and the third is one I do not know as well, but a teacher I really like and admire. happens after I graduate, I am fairly certain I will never again have the regularity and comfort of the interactions I can have now, so I am trying to soak up as many memories of kindnesses as I can, in case I need them to sustain me for the rest of my life.

I would like very much to record the exam, partly so I can review how I did after, but mostly because I would like to preserve the memory of the people I like best in world making time just to help me. It sounds very selfish to put it like that haha, but I guess it is truth. I do not think the teachers say anything other than asking me questions, it is mostly just the fact of their presence I want to preserve. are questions: My computer is a Mac laptop. If I record by doing hift+Command+5 and recording screen instead of recording through the in-app Zoom function, will the other meeting participants know I am recording? If so, is there any other way to record meeting so that they will not know? Is it immoral to record the exam without them knowing? I am maybe 90% sure they wouldn’t care, all of them regularly recorded Zoom classes when school was all virtual, but I am too shy and embarrassed to ask. I would have to admit why I wanted to have a recording, and I would feel creepy and pathetic. is of course possible I will fail exam, and will not want to watch again haha.

A ‘deeper’ form than mine, maybe combined with ADHD. We’ve been pretty close, he confessed he likes me, that he cares about me. He tried to do some gestures in the past to show care, but when it comes to reaching out…. He did it less and less over the course of the year. Everytime we talk, I feel how sensitive he is. I am a ‘weak spot’ for him but he keeps me at distance. I can ‘read him’ and I offer him all the support and time he needs. I never pressure him. I never rush him. He likes me for it.  the more he cares, the last i become on his priority list. Does it make sense? he saw i’m understanding, he now prioritises his work or people who have less patience with him. And … we talk less and less.  time I thought he just moved on and I decided to leave him alone. I told him i can’t be so involved and close to him if he pushes me away. Then he instantly panicked, he apologized and he said he will change. The ‘change’ lasted few weeks then ahen he felt we are ok, he distanced himself again comes to ask me if im ok once in a while.

I'm not looking for confirmation of a diagnosis or anything of that nature; I'm simply curious to see if my experiences are shared amongst others here.

In retrospect, there were often times I would make comments that would be interpreted as insulting/insensitive, which always blindsided me and occasionally cost me friendships, but it's difficult for me to distinguish now how much of this was temporary social incompetency vs. potentially legitimate disorder.  I remember telling my close friend in 5th grade upon learning his dad was a fisherman ""Your dad must not make too much money"" because I had started reading The Old Man and the ea earlier in the week.  Hard to know if I was just an asshole before learning better or if there's something more there.   also grew up with a relatively unorthodox family dynamic.  My biological father was physically/emotional abusive and my mother left with me as an infant where I grew up half the week with my grandparents, half the week with my mother, and the weekend days with my biological father.     My mother also struggled with mood disorders during this time that created a lot of volatility, punctuated by a couple changes in step-fathers.  uffice to say, there was a lot of contradictory/unstable forces on my development that did little to encourage healthy emotional growth.  I believe during this time I leaned on intellectualization to rationalize my environment and make a bit of sense of the world.  I obsessed myself with hobbies such as astronomy, paleontology, and geography, which grew into a deeper love of science and learning -- often obsessively and often cyclically.   and high school continued much the same way, compounding certain social incompetencies and awkwardness but providing productive outlets such as robotics and other extracurriculars.  College provided a great test bed to improve my social skills and redefine myself (or rather start to develop a sense of myself for the first time).  After several years and several friend groups, I started to mature much more socially and really begin to function well amongst my peers.  However, since that time, there were several events that would begin to re-call into question any atypicality.   several years in college, I lost both my grandparents that co-raised me, a stepdad, an uncle, and several close family friends to cancer, heart attacks, accidents, etc.  Rather than the expected grief, I've honestly felt very little emotional response to any of these tragedies and been more perplexed and overwhelmed by the emotional waves of everyone around me during each of these passings.  And much to my disorientation, this lack of emotional response is also present when ending friendships and most romantic relationships, moving away without homesickness/family-sickness, and perhaps lack of attachment to inherited culture/religion, etc.  I understand this probably sounds terrible and I've long felt the same way, though, speaking with a therapist on this has helped alleviate the associated guilt.   I've gotten older, I've accepted my introversion more and felt less impulse to fight my own aversion to socialization in favor of living the glorified young life.  I really dislike bars/clubs (despite paradoxically owning a bar now) and all the noise and social expectation that comes with it. I lasted 5 bartending shifts before quitting that part of the business and I struggle to maintain a presence in my business during open hours (though the mask mandate has made it easier). mall talk and socializing with people are doable for me and I would consider myself relatively competent, but it's extremely exhausting and grating.  Eye contact to me is totally doable but is always a conscious decision and costs energy. For every hour I spend socializing, I feel I need three alone.  I've always hated crowds and been the first or last person to leave a theater. In college, it made me physically uncomfortable to eat in the crowded dining halls and I would always take my food to-go unless on rare occasion I had to eat a meal with friends.   terms of my current social dynamic, I feel as though I have 2 or 3 good friends and have very little energy for anything more.  For most of my life, I've felt as though I had to social chameleon to fit in any social groups, which I believe may be similar to masking.  I love my current semi-close relationships I have with my rather atypical friends that respect my personal space and tolerate the occasional social distance.  I've also had difficulty finding someone I connect with in terms of dating since moving back to a small town post-college. finally as I'm running out of cohesive structure, a hodgepodge of various and hopefully tangentially related thoughts.  I really dislike team sports and the pressures that come with it, though I am functional in group projects. I love car license plates, locker numbers, phone numbers, etc., though I hate that my county was assigned so many plates that start with the letter Z... it's very hard to come up with acronyms.  I dislike hugging and hand shaking and usually fumble the process.  I hated events such as prom and graduation; there were so many people and social expectations muddled with social anxiety.  I'm slow to develop emotional attachments to people.  It's about impossible for me to imaginatively conjure images in my mind of fictional places/characters, though I enjoy reading fiction.  I am terrible with imagination, especially with kids.  I sometimes have difficulty understanding character motives in stories, but not because they're incomprehensible, but because they're often emotionally driven and thereby seemingly irrational.   speaking with my therapist, I took several preliminary (and clearly inconclusive) online tests and scored 32/50 for my Autism Quotient. This, along with the above reflection, has made me start to question things.  However, on the contrary, typical symptoms that align with AD such as sensory overload (other than crowds), needing strong routine, inability to read and give social cues (at least now), and being identified as impolite (at least to my awareness) don't seem to apply well to my current self.  am very to curious to hear if anything here resonates.  At the very least, I will of course be continuing this conversation with my therapist.  Thank you to anyone that's made it this far!Possible ASD qualities, do other people feel the same? Social chameleon, emotional disconnect, etc.",1633079616,7437,1220
aspergers,"Hi there. o, I have been into this subject a lot recently, as I think that there is a possibility for me to have Asperger's, but I was not able to schedule an appointment with someone that knows about this stuff until now. would want to know if you could compare some of the stereotypes or myths that people tend to believe with your personal experience. For example, how true is it that people on the spectrum are not able to recognize sarcasm/be sarcastic? Or how true is it that you take most things too literally?  feel like I can be pretty sarcastic sometimes, but some other times, I am not able to tell if someone else is being sarcastic unless it is somewhat obvious. taking things literally, I think I take things literally when people use the word ""literally"", like, that's the trigger word, but I am still able to know if someone is not using the word properly. I wouldn't say I am too literal, I just tend to not always get the context. For example, you could be talking about a mouse (referring to the animal) and most likely I would think you are talking about a computer mouse, but that could just be a normal thing. I'm excited to read your replies. Thanks!.What are some myths/stereotypes/things that NT's often get wrong about people with Asperger's?",1633078699,1268,229
aspergers,"Hey y'all, it happened again but first some back story. Found out I caught the Aspergers at age 10 when I switched to public from private school and the teachers/ parents started to wonder why I was so damn weird. They sent me to a few therapists who couldn't figure it out until a they gave me a full IQ test. They found out that I was off the charts in things like math and problem solving but I was seriously below average in my social skills and understanding body language, things like that. That in addition to a meeting with a doctor and psychiatrist they determined I was on the Aspergers autism spectrum. Luckily my parents were pretty good like %80 of the time. They kind of had the attitude of ""oh well guess he's got Aspergers darn"" and let me be myself. a lot of you I've struggled greatly with love and lust in the age of loneliness. Found it impossible to get the time of day from a girl until I was probably 20. I came into my own, found my look, lost a bunch of weight, and suddenly as if by magic could get some traction with females. I had my fun, but the entire time I really wanted a relationship. o far there has been four that have been shut down, close up shop, forever and ever type women that have each ended catastrophically in there own spectacular unique ways. Three are stories for another day. I really don't know what my deal is, I don't get on with many people and far fewer romantically but when I do I seem to get attached. I still have yet to have a serious girlfriend, its been many several week flings or ""dates"" that were code for hooking up. More than a few times I've found myself unknowingly on the wrong side of a rebound. ometimes I think I crave the attention, to have someone want to ask me what I'm thinking about, or miss me, or hang out with me in the daytime. I can't seem to read the signs, and then get blindsided by an inevitable split. It usually puts me in a huge funk for what seems like forever. It hadn't happened in almost a year but it happened again. amazing. Definitely passes the vibe check. I don't really want to say too much because privacy but we got along great, some similar interests but different enough to keep it interesting. We met a few years ago and went out label free for two months, until one day she just wasn't in the state of mind to date when I brought it up. I threw up one final hail mary about a week later because I thought she was making a mistake. No dice. It fucked up my whole summer 11/10 bad funk. Fast forward to earlier this month. We match on tinder, and we start talking again. Get together later that week and have an awesome time. Couple weeks and hangs later I make mention of being more serious and get shut down hard again, bring on the funk. This could honestly be all my own doing for going back to someone who obviously doesn't like me like that but I'll be goddamned if I saw it coming. What can I say it seemed like she did. C'est la vie time over. Keep it real everyoneIt happened again",1633064877,2994,575

aspergers,"My boyfriend is a very emotional person, to the point of being overly emotionally invested or affected, especially by personal interactions. He is very kind and soft-hearted, the kind of guy to cry during a sappy movie. He gets very drained by discussions with people and is quick to interpret things as criticism, although he is not particularly insecure and doesn't have low self-esteem per se. It stems from him attributing extreme emotional weight to statements or situations. Normally, my calmer, rational approach helps him and gives him a less emotional perspective on those interactions, but if the issue arises between us, it's different. suspect he doesn't intuitively get people, similarly to me, but he goes way beyond basic analysis of social cues and puts interpretations/intentions there that aren't actually the case. with my autistic obliviousness/alexithymia, it's an explosive combination. We have many situations where I ask a purely impersonal question or make a factual statement that is devoid of any emotional meaning, and he injects so much emotions that completely details the conversation. I can't *not* push his buttons, because there aren't any emotions in my words or facial expressions, so I can't take them out.

aspergers,"Hi ! I don’t know if this is the right place to post this so I may cross post it elsewhere.I’m 18f and I was diagnosed with ADHD about 6 months ago. Well, I got more then just the ADHD diagnosis… was diagnosed with five different things : adhd, Borderline personality disorder, avoidance personality disorder, social anxiety and delay sleep syndrome. The sleep problems were taken care of by some meds and a lot of help from the new therapist I got after the diagnosis.  something that kinda… surprised me when I was getting my diagnosis with the psychiatrist is that, while he was listing the things he did not think I have, he said (and I quote) “I don’t think you have autism because you are interested in others”. Now at the time I didn’t really think much of it because, why would I ?  a few months ago I remember that and I realized I didn’t understand what it meant. Like… what does it mean to be “interested in others” ?? I don’t have autism because I have a few friends ? I realized it didn’t make sense to me. Plus, i was starting to relate more and more to autistic experiences. ome YouTube videos had me in also tears, especially when talking about masking behaviours.  I decided to reach out again to my psychiatrist to ask him if we could set another appointment to discuss autism more and he refused, saying that my symptoms were more fitting of the avoidance and social anxiety. (He also said if I had specific examples he could revisit the diagnosis, whatever “specific example” means.)  as I’ve been doing a lot of work with my therapist about my social anxiety, I feel like my anxiety was also masking my possible autism symptoms. But now that I don’t have that much social anxiety, I realize I still have no clue how to socialize with people.  I’m kinda of lost, and I want answers do I can know how to deal with myself more effectively. But I also don’t wanna say that I have autism in case I’m wrong…  anyone have any advice ?

aspergers,"I’m currently a college student at the moment, taking a single lab course this semester, so I’m just barely a part-time student. Yet, just spending five hours per week in class with 19 other students simply exhausts me. It takes me a few days of sleep and solitude just to feel better again.  by itself isn’t enough. I get around 8-10 hours per night on average (plus several hours of napping each day after class), but I’m still just exhausted. It’s hard being around other people. The lights in the room are buzzy and bright. I can hear every tapping pencil and exhale and tongue click. Masking just by itself is fucking hard. Caffeine helps, but only barely.  so scared that I will never be able to function properly in society because of just how tired I get. I’m worried I am destined to live alone in a shitty house paid for by welfare and disability. I’m scared that I’ll never find a job I can do 100% at home that pays well and I’m good at.  social stuff just ain’t my forte. I’m getting better at interacting with people, but I can tell I still seem “off” at times, or I take idioms too literally. I also don’t understand a damn thing about etiquette, so being in any sort of PR position would never work. Neither would any sort of job where I am even remotely interacting with people, because of how draining it is.  recently started seeing a therapist who works specifically with people like me, and so far, things are going well.

They interrupt what I'm working on several times an hour with *urgent* requests that *must* be done *right* now.

aspergers,"I (m,22) recently moved states for school and have three new roommates. Two of them are good friends who, like me, keep to themselves and are really down to earth, and I get along with them really well. My third roommate started out pretty cool but within a week I had a bad feeling about him because he would constantly be on his phone and clearly was very obsessed with his image. Fast forward to a month and a half later and we’re all on super thin ice with this guy. He now walks around 24/7 with his face in his phone and AirPods in, even if we’re hanging out and talking to him. He’s told me multiple times that I need to clean up the kitchen more and to “be better at it”, even though my other two roommates haven’t once said it’s a problem so I find it extremely condescending. There was also a day where I was doing drawing homework at the communal table and had most of my stuff spread out on it because I needed the space to rotate the pages while drawing,  and without saying anything he came over and started shoving all of my stuff to the side so he could eat a couple of burritos, which he didn’t even need the table for. He was eating with his mouth open the whole time which drives me insane, and then stayed another 10 minutes or so just looking at his phone while I was just waiting for him to move so I could get back to what I was doing. To top it all off, this roommate has a small dog that he owns but the dog seems to like me and my other roommates more than his owner at this point and it’s become obvious that he doesn’t show the dog any attention or affection; my other roommates have heard the dog yelping multiple times when he’s with his owner. It’s at the point where the dog is in my room all the time and will literally cling to me when my roommate comes in to take him. I don’t want to create problems with the roommate bc I’ve had enough of that in the past but I feel like something needs to be said or done about the dog situation at the very least. I guess I’m just looking for some help on how to deal with him because I’m terrible at masking how I feel about people and he exhibits so many of the NT characteristics that I can’t stand.

Here's some questions for you guys!: Does the title sound like bad use to you? If you know this will build tolerance and stop working I'd like know. Have you tried infrequent benzo dosing like this?

I know the dangers, I'm not dependent on it. I don't have addiction issues nor intend to take this enough to cause withdrawel.  recently noticed that after recreationally taking some Xanax for the first time since I started this healthy kick I was feeling exceptionally confident and productive for about just over a week (This was after taking 3mg one night). I'm very concerned with the dangers of Xanax use, dependancy, withdrawel and tolerance. I never ever want to use Daily or even close since the medication doesn't seem to be effective immediately after the dose. Yet it seems to have a huge impact the following days on how I can function. Which leads me to this point. I take benzos I feel lazy and tired yet for the week following the dose I feel... Almost cured? If not cured, at least so calm and collected that there's little to no restriction on my executive function. It makes me feel like, how anxious I've always been is just some kind of funny joke, like I'm a lot more okay than I thought. In this calmer week I'm usually just nailing everything, colleagues find me funnier, I have more fun, I get more done.

I literally can't remember what happened last week unless I got some notes/recordings of that day, or unless someone reminds me of it. Then, suddenly my memories come back. for some other things, I remember data that I really didn't pay attention to.

The next day, I moved it again, but this time I could remember the original position, even when I didn't really pay attention to it. that's not exactly what I am referring to. The thing is that some weeks ago, I wrote a script. While writing that script, ""memories"" of random places I've been to came back to me, for example, certain shop from a mall. I just read the script today, and those memories of the place came back when I began to read that part.

I know she wasn't intending to be dismissive or malicious, but she made a comment about how ""too many"" people consider themselves autistic these days.

I see both pros and cons with aspergers, and I have to say, I'm an incredibly empathetic person, but the honesty and directness of aspergers is truly refreshing in an overly fake world whereby many peoples conversation is well and truly flawed and faked. anyone could advise whether me texting him a nice little random How's your evening going message would cause him more stress than joy, that would be great. Obviously I know aspies all differ but I have to start somewhere, and a general answer would be helpful. Many thanks!Advice on texting my partner",1632863667,1260,224

aspergers,"I am not diagnosed as being on the spectrum, but I have suspected I am for about a decade, so I feel like it is relevant to post here.  am about to turn 25 and I still don't have my license. I took the road test twice when I was 18 and failed both times. The last time, the instructor yelled at me and called me stupid, which kind of scarred me to say the least. That, coupled with severe dissociation and sensory issues, made me completely stop trying. I didn't try to drive a car again until a year ago when I was 23/24.  am much more mentally stable than I used to be, so I have a much easier time concentrating now, but it's still difficult. It can be incredibly overwhelming and overstimulating for me (having to pay attention to so much, all the sounds, angry/annoying drivers). ometimes I get so overstimulated that I feel like I'm going to have a meltdown, and then when I'm done I am exhausted and needing a nap. On the flip side, if I am too under stimulated while driving, my dissociation gets worse. I took some lessons and I still feel ill-prepared for the road test. I still practice with my boyfriend, but it feels like I'll never be ready. I'm just feeling incredibly bummed out because I have wanted my license forever and it feels like I'm closer, but still not there. I'm wondering if anyone has had a similar experience and has any advice. Thanks.Having so much trouble driving",1632857703,1397,260
aspergers,"I've moved across the country and find myself 30M with no friends in my state. I'm not sure where to find ""my people"" because those who are on-paper ""my people"" I don't really care to engage with socially. I've had some offers - coworkers in similar places in life. They are perfectly good people, but I simply don't care to connect with them. Even though I do have classically autistic interests, I have virtually no desire to connect with others socially about these.  has been a general theme in my life, as I meet NT ""connectors"" they say ""oh hey thr0waway\_leg you might want to meet &lt;Person&gt;"" and the &lt;Person&gt; is someone interested in tech or is perhaps autistic and quirky themselves and I very much don't want to be bundled into this group of autistic geek for my social life. Most neurotypicals don't respect my strengths or don't know how to connect with me in a way that is mutually beneficial. not universal, I have interacted with many fellow autistics who are lively and have interests beyond computer science and sci-fi that make them fun and insightful (to me) to hang out with. I've also had success with the LGBT community because they understand going to the beat of their own drum but also have a deep appreciation for art and overall vibes. But me being straight as a nail myself (and more or less asexual) there's a disconnect there. rather talk about sports, music, history, politics, etc. I've compartmentalized the clinically autistic comp sci part of me as ""work"" and so when I'm not at work (or even at work TBH) I have 0 interest in passionately discussing these topics with others. But neurotypicals get the wrong vibes from me that I'm overly intellectual and therefore I want to spend my free time engaging that way, which nope! Wrong read. instance: my landlord had an autistic friend who was also an ex-coworker and I couldn't stand him socially. To me he seemed very dull and his programmer humor was very dry: mid 40s, unmarried, awkward, and also a highly sensitive person. While I genuinely cared for him and hope he has a good life, I deeply cringed inside every time I had to spend time with him despite the fact that he was a good, kind person that on paper I had a lot in common with. I'm too afraid to socialize with neurotypicals because they often either won't respect me because of my mannerisms, or I find boring, or will often orient me towards meeting people of ""my kind"" but I also can't really stand being around other autistics because I already occupy that head space a sufficient amount. realize this might sound condescending, and that's not my intent. Everyone on the spectrum deserves love and respect. I'm hurting because I'm left friendless and the ""beggars can't be choosers"" doesn't hold up to me because I'd rather spend my time with myself then just accept the default social opportunities that society is sending my way. Given this... Any suggestions?Don't want the friends society is offering me. (30M)",1632855998,2978,520

aspergers,"Theres a person in my college class who is obviously autistic, you can see it, from the way he dresses, he behaves, he talks and so on. I dont know why but I really really respect him for who he is, just the thought that he probably never learned to mask and he lived like that all his live makes me respect him even more. why but everytime I see him Im thinking about how this is kinda me just not as far on the spectrum and how I was before I started masking. Because of that it makes me sad seeing how people react to him, like they dont know that this could me, makes me wonder if I'd rather be far out on the spectrum or be able to hide it. have pros and cons, but I wonder if one would suffer more or less if not masking and being further out on the spectrum, on the one hand you wont get accepted as often if ever, on the other you dont have to hide. I have a deep fear of beeing seen as weird or so, maybe if that was not the case I would be able to live without hiding it? be honest I do not know where I am going with this, just a small monolog.Respect to every autistic individual who didnt learn to hide it.",1632852264,1119,231

aspergers,"Do you guys struggle from not being able to identify what you're feeling? ometimes I'll become very wound up and anxious without realizing it. It often takes days to realize what I'm stressed about. Usually it's because I have an event coming up, or under pressure to get something done at work, but sometimes it's an emotional problem that is harder to pin down.  a procrastinator by nature. I think I subconsciously bury my responsibilities deep in my mind, but it's like my body can't forget. (Thank god for body, otherwise I'd never get anything done). I'll wait till the last minute, then be flooded with with the energy to do the thing. If I try to start sooner I can't focus.  bring that up because it feels like the procrastination mechanism could be related to burying my emotions.

I have been to therapists, psychologists, everyone and have been told many things (Depression, ADHD, OCD, mood disorder, etc.) The only problem was I never felt like anyone was willing to actually listen to what I had to say or take me seriously. They just wanted me out of there office, and prancing merrily off to the banks of rich doctors to deposit their paycheck.) I have done thousands of hours of research on most mental disorders, medications, treatments, etc. I have prayed to God trying to ask what it is that is wrong with my brain. My one wish was just for a label to help me understand and cope with my brain. Then one day it arose in my field of consciousness the possibility that I should research autism/ asper. hortly after some research all the dots started connecting almost violently fast in my head. uddenly my entire life had been explained to me or at least labeled and served the purpose of vindicating my lowercase self as a person who was not alone, but could attribute everything. Practically everything I read about Asperger’s explained everything I’ve experienced and am experiencing. From the narrow interest, to the lack of social skills, the social monologues, sensory disorder, the rather sever executive disfunction, literally this explain everything about my life, right now my brain is like holy shit, hard to process.

aspergers,"o today I got into a fight today at school which I am not proud of with the fact that I just got my stuff and left. I was in the bathroom, after doing my business I went to go wash my hands,after that some kid started throwing gang signs in my face. I asked him to stop twice but he got more aggressive with the gang signs. I then got annoyed then pushed his hands out of my face then I just told him to stop throwing gang signs in my face. Then he got mad I punched me like 6 times until I gained control of him and put him in a choke hold. I had him in the hold for like 60 seconds. 45 seconds in I look around,I'm a white kid choking a black kid and a bunch of black kids are looking at me like I'm a monster. I then release him from the hold not realizing that I had been choking him to the point where he was having trobule breathing. ome kids come to help him meanwhile I'm going to my panish class with a devolping black eye and a cut on my nose packing up my stuff to leave. I gathered my things and just walked out the nearest school exit. I then went to a park near my house to gather my emotions, sat on a bench for 10 minutes,went home to face whatever punishment I may receive for skipping. I did not receive punishment from my parents but I maybe reciving punishment from the school not for nearly choking a kid out but for skipping which i admit was really stupid on my part. Later the campus police came to my house to make sure I was okay, asked me my side of the story as well as questions which I answered honestly and took pictures of my injuries. All and all not my best day but for right now the school has asked me to stay home while they solve this case. There maybe pending punishment but to be honest I don't care I'll take it.
