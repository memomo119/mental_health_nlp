depression,"I don‚Äôt know where to start with this so I‚Äôll just say that where I am now is wanting to die, I see no reason to live. I have to hide who I am everyday, watch students make homophobic remarks to other people who are brave enough to be themselves and I‚Äôll never be that brave, I‚Äôll never have any high school memories, I‚Äôll never make any true friends, and it feels like I‚Äôm not living as myself‚Ä¶ but as someone else. It‚Äôs heartbreaking and it‚Äôs tearing me up inside. I don‚Äôt know what to do because I have no one to talk to about this which is just making my situation worse.

depression,"oooo, this is my first time on an antidepressant and I'm on setraline. I was on 50 mg for 5 weeks and then got increased to 100 mg. I don't feel low and any despair, but the only thing I want to do is sleep. My anxiety is way down. I can go to work and such, but I just feel bored and not motivated or interested in anything.  else have this occur and did it pass? Wondering if I just have too much seratonin now and my dopamine is depleted. There is a chance I could be pregnant, but won't find out until next week.  wondering if reducing my dose will balance me out? heard that adding Wellbutrin may be good, but not sure about adding things if I'm pregnant. have an appointment with my therapist next week. I'm interested to see what she says. worry. I'm not going to do anything drastic like stop cold turkey or anything. I just worry that taking this could be worsening the apathy.

depression,"o, a bit of history. weeks ago I had a panic attack during which I hurt myself.Went to se my doctor, who put me obln sick leave for 4 weeks, awaiting a psychiatrist appointment. said appointment today and the psychiatrist got me started on medication, I know which ones and have taken them before. He also argued I should look into adapted working conditions and be extremely carefull. did not put me on sick leave, saying that I'm technically able to work if its tailored and adapted to my needs and since I am in the process of getting help in that department from another organism and me being sick could potentially halt those efforts. Also I am currently unemployed so, other than shielding me from potential initiatives from the employment office, sick leave would only result in Hassel with the insurance company. I got home I called dad and he couldn't understand why I'm not on sick leave and as I told him that I was physically exhausted, he went on to belittle my effort as a perceived effort. I got the feeling that he things I'm either exaggerating or faking it because it ain't bad enough for me to be on sick leave. this make sense to anyone else cause i don't get that kind of reaction at all.A bit baffeled after a visit at the psychiatrist and a call to my dad.",1635427858,1279,235
depression,"I come from a very Indian family. I'm a single child and my father has high expectations of me. I've been secretly struggling with depression for more than 3 years now and this is the first time I'm even expressing somewhere. cannot feel joy/ happiness even when there's a reason to feel happy. I'm just numb to any kind of happiness. This depression is taking a severe toll on my moods, irritability, TUDIE, everyday stuff etc. It's become soooooo hard to do even simple things. I became so dull I can't even do simple math. I used to ace every math test and used to be generally pretty good at math. Now I can't even think clearly or do the simplest of additions  with my brain getting foggy. orry if my rant is funny lol. Well, it's not just that. It's also crippling loneliness because of this and pretty dark thoughts every single day.  do I tell my parents any of this? This will just crush them. I do think I need help but they don't have a clue of what goes on in my mind. I NEVER show my sadness when they're around. They'd say they've given me everything I could ever ask for and I'm still depressed. I don't even think they'd understand anything if I told them. What do I do?! be pretty disappointed as well. Ugh I fucking hate myself.  you read this shit, thanks a ton. Any advice is welcome.How do I tell my parents that I am depressed?",1635427686,1349,254
depression,"Tbh, I don't know how to start this thread but i feel like garbage. I don't want to do anything anymore. My family disowned me for being shit. I tried commiting suicide by hanging. The rope had already been tied to my neck but my relatives walked in. Unfortunately, they didn't give a damn about it and ignored it by walking past by it, completely aware of what I was doing. I didn't continue because my death would just be swift. I wanted to punish myself for being a piece of shit. never expect anyone to care about a shit person like me. This may even be my last day, I hope.  posted this thread because I don't want anyone else to become shit like me. I failed the expectations of my family and don't make mistakes.

depression,yesterday I sent my nephew home and he cried when he saw me leave. It usually won‚Äôt bother me much but then I started crying that day. it wasn‚Äôt just a tear but buckets of them.

depression,"when i was in sophomore year, i told my boyfriend about my dream college during this project we had to do about colleges. he then went on to research more in depth about and all they had to offer. one day he told me about a summer program the college was having for juniors in high school. he had already started the application process and told me to apply as well. anyways i applied and as part of the application process, we had to rank the courses offered as part of the program. he ranked economics first because that‚Äôs what he is interested in, and i ranked molecular engineering first because that‚Äôs what i was interested in. long story short i was rejected of the program and he got in the course that i wanted. i understood that he was smarter than me and better than me so i just congratulated him and was genuinely happy for him even. with the program, came a free trip to the city in which the university is located (aka my dream city which is why i wanted to attend that university in the first place). he ended up going on the trip along with the other scholars that made the summer program. through his posts i realized how much fun he was having and all the great friends he made through program, which made me sad and jealous even, but more sad. then now senior year, we both applied to this scholarship that could guarantee us a full ride to an amazing college, my dream university being one of them. we both worked hard on our application and when decisions you can already guess what happened; he was chosen a finalist and i was not. this broke my heart really because i know that he will be matched to my dream university because of his affiliation with it and at the end of the day i hope he does get matched to them because that is his dream university now too. still, i cant help but feel resentment, anger, and jealousy. the worst part is he didn‚Äôt even recognize how this might make me feel considering that was my dream university first.   now i am depressed and i‚Äôm this state of learned helplessness where i don‚Äôt know if i want to even continue fighting for my academic future. i now suffer from extreme anxiety and depression because of previous events throughout our relationship and this.i don‚Äôt want to keep fighting for my future anymore.",1635426304,2273,421

depression,"I've battled with depression for most of my life being 36 now. I suffered from a brain injury that required craniotomies when I was 23. This happened from a motorcycle wreck. I also broke my neck. Just this year I had another motorcycle wreck and my femur was broken and a finger amputated. I'm going through a very difficult period in my life now. I communicated very wicked thoughts to family members who I thought should be there for me when I was recovering in the hospital. And now no matter how much I apologize and try to explain that I wasn't in my right mind no one is listening to me, no one is responding. I've gone to a couple sessions of therapy trying to get on track to better thinking. I have an appointment next week in attempts to get on some medications for depression. They have held me in the past, but due to my history of abusing alcohol and pot I never stuck with them long enough to see consistent improvements. just want my life back. I lost my UV and my job and I went to jail earlier this year and that's what led to me living a dangerous life riding around on a motorcycle not drunk but high. I stopped consuming those substances, it's been over half a year for alcohol but not nearly as long for pot. I'm very sad and remorseful.

depression,"TLDR: impulsively tried to commit when I was at a great point in life, no previous suicidal thoughts the past few months, no sad events or anything either. Trying to make sense of what happened to know what to change or avoid but I really don‚Äôt know. cared because I felt unusually peaceful with dying before the attempt, and my whole mood changed in a few minutes. orry for misspellings/errors ahead of time. honestly don‚Äôt know how to process this at all. I‚Äôve been doing really fine, I‚Äôve been taking my meds consistently, I‚Äôve been hanging out with friends more, school and work was going decently, just moved into a gorgeous home with the love of my life, and I had a lot of things to look forward to.  last Friday I somehow came to the conclusion that I just don‚Äôt want to be here anymore, so I got super wasted, and took a bunch of pills. I remember telling myself that it isn‚Äôt worth it to keep going, that I‚Äôd feel better if I just went to sleep and never woke up. I‚Äôve been through some hard things in this lifetime, but I‚Äôve been going to therapy, I have a great support system, and my medication regimen works very very very well for me. I just don‚Äôt even know how it happened? I was literally doing good, I‚Äôve gotten through lower points in life, I wasn‚Äôt even sad before I decided to take the pills.  thing that actually scared me about this attempt was how at peace I was with this decision. Anytime I‚Äôve ever had suicidal thoughts or attempts there‚Äôs this conflict between hating my life and wanting to die but this feeling of uncertainty of death. This time though, I didn‚Äôt feel that at all. I felt like it was the best decision and that it was the right thing to do. I have a video I drunkenly recorded right before where I‚Äôm crying and saying how tired I am and how my life seems like a punishment, like I was already in hell. But I‚Äôm telling you, last year was particularly hard, but things have turned around. guess it could‚Äôve been the alcohol? Or some suppressed feelings, or stress? I don‚Äôt know I‚Äôve just never felt that way before, everything changed in a matter of minutes. I told the doctors and everyone it was just the alcohol and I made a dumb impulsive decision, but it can‚Äôt just be that? I was drunk but I‚Äôve been drunker and never got suicidal. Is it just my brain? I‚Äôm on Wellbutrin and lexapro and I know that day I didn‚Äôt take them because I woke up late in the day, but missing one day isn‚Äôt ever much of a problem. I want to get better and prevent this from happening but I cannot make sense of what happened.Released from the hospital today",1635424612,2582,484

We met at a party the next day to talk about it, admited liking me a lot from day 1, not having any intention to go back to that abusive guy and said she wanted to start something up w me (we preety much flirted all the time, but i ve never crossed that line bc i once knew her bf and what not). That week was the best week of my life, i felt hard for her while going out every day w her (not having my guard up like w other girls), she led me on, being the best girl romantically and friendly speaking i ve been with.

depression,o I‚Äôm 15 and I was admitted to a psychiatric ward mid september. I felt really uncomfortable there and I also really disliked my therapist. Yesterday I ran away from there and the police brought me back. I told them I don‚Äôt want to be there anymore and that it just makes me more suicidal. They told me that they can‚Äôt let me leave if I can‚Äôt confirm that I won‚Äôt do anything to myself. The Youth Welfare Office is now taking me in care until if find a place at a youth living group. I just want to cry. I just don‚Äôt know what to do. I know and they know that it is better for me to stay there and  I and they also know that I‚Äôm very much still suicidal. Literally nothing changed for me. And I know that I would just be living but not enjoying it. I very much ashamed of running away and I was trying to tell them that I want to change the station because being there made me uncomfortable but they didn‚Äôt listen. They didn‚Äôt take me serious. I will die and no one will care or notice. I just wish I wouldn‚Äôt be so proud and just tell them that I need help. Actually I tried. I tried telling them that I know I need help and that I just can‚Äôt really talk. I even got over my fears and talk to a few of them about my suicidality but I guess they forgot about it? I just don‚Äôt know what to do. They see that i‚Äòm crying for help but just not in the right context but don‚Äôt care about it. I was really trying to participate in therapy it was so hard and now because of my stupid dumb worthless self I destroyed the chance of getting help. I don‚Äòt even know what I want but just want to be noticed. And I know I was really trying. Right now I‚Äôm in a patient room which is monitored and they still can‚Äôt see that I‚Äôm not fine and that I‚Äôm crying. The last time I ate was the day before yesterday. They noticed that. I stopped talking. They noticed that. I stopped drinking anything. They also noticed that. They know that I feel uncomfortable about everything. But still. It‚Äôs also my fault for thinking that they would make the first step for me but hoping they would make it with me wasn‚Äôt wrong right? hould I have lower expectations? Did I demand too much?

depression,"As stated in the title, I've lost the will to go to school. I don't really know what's really wrong though. Up until now, I was almost a straight A student. I never actually got straight A's though, always at least 1 B in a subject. I found most of my classes pretty easy and never  had much of an issue with finishing work on time or anything like that. I was in a short relationship that kinda fucked me up near the end of the school year. It ruined a  bunch of friendships and made things awardward within my class. That only dropped my cience and Math grades down to around 80% though. It wasn't even that bad. Every single day I had a stomach ache. Everytime I saw certain people, I just felt sick immediately. This continued into this year. After the doctor told me it was all mental, the stomach aches stopped, but I still can't stand to be near some of those people. I lost a lot of my trust in other people.   now, other than the reasons above, I feel like I've overwhelmed myself with hobbies and interests. I parrticipate in a competitive sport for 9 hours a week, I started a club that happens twice a week, I'm on a robotics team with some friends that meet once a week and of course I play a lot of video games. I feel like there's never enough time in the week to do those things if I also want to finish my homework and go to school.    I mean, its not like I don't have friends. I have quite a lot in fact, but for some reason I still feel like I'm alone. My parents and my sibling are nice to me, I don't have any issues at home. Other than what happened last year, everything else in my life seems like its almost perfect. I don't know though. I think I might just be burning myself out, trying to keep occupied so I don't stop.    work habits have gone to shit, I failed a physics test last week and I've missed 3 days of school.

When I first told them about my depression I don‚Äôt think they believed me.. but rather told me to help around the house more, or focus more on my studies to keep my mind off of it. I was sad about it, because I felt really guilty that they endured through so much trying to provide me and my siblings with a better life, and here I was depressed and wanting to die.

It's not as bad as it used to be. There were times, when I didn't step out of my house for weeks, got anxiety attacks if I heard the doorbell, ate junk, drank and smoked, basically every kind of unhealthy lifestyle you can think of. the pandemic, we started working from home, and I left my ""worktown"" to travel to my hometown. That helped a lot. I've been clean and sober for more than 2 years now. Even lost little bit of weight (not much). But with offices opening back up, I am back at work. Its been a week, since I have been back, and I can already feel myself falling back to my old habits. I spend all day laying in bed if not at work, watching netflix, eating junk food, no exercise. don't really have anyone else's I can talk to about this stuff. I don't want to worry my parents, since they are kind of old fashioned and their goto solution for depression is, ""get married"", which I don't want right now (or ever). Have a few friends, but they too are useless. I told one of them about what I was going through and they told that I should have stayed home, which isn't really a permanent solution. I had even tried a couple of therapists for few months but that too wasn't really helpful. last 2 days, I have picked up journaling. Nothing extensive, more like a todo list. I came across a quote while watching a show, ""progress, not perfection"". And I realized, I don't need to be perfect, just need to make some progress everyday, no matter how small. Journaling kind of helps with keeping track.

Jealous in 2 ways - the fact that they can be excited about working and work 24/7, and the fact that they work so hard and get promoted.

I make myself believe I'm am not worthy of love, I will only hurt people, and that I can not love someone else if I can not love myself(which are all kind of the same thing) Therefore I only reach out to someone whenever I'm on the verge of giving away all my possessions and following through with my suicide plan. I then feel selfish for doing so. I only talked to them or hung out with them out of my own selfish needs. I am self-centered, like most people. I genuinely care about my friends, yet I'm fixated on myself, which only feels natural. I am an animal. I am out for my survival, but that feels morally wrong to me, and I don't know why. If evolution is the truth, why should I feel wrong for my animal instincts? I'm only doing what is best for me and there is nothing wrong with that. But that thought contradicts my isolation. If I completely isolate myself, I'll go insane and definitely kill myself. Maybe I do that until my mind goes into fight or flight? And that is why I reach out? Out of another survival mechanism? The only living souls I put before myself are children and my cat/past dogs. I live a depressing lifestyle. I want to burn bridges, but I I hate doing it. I'll probably read this tomorrow and think I am completely dramatic, but it is how I feel now, and venting on Reddit fells more manageable than writing in a journal for some reason. If someone else feels the same that that would be awesome.Edit: I have found it more therapeutic to write to other people than myself. I can rationalize myself and my thoughts. If I read my diary, I think, ‚Äúoh yeah, that makes sense, and I still feel the same,‚Äù but when I tell other people, they can give different perspectives.

depression,"I was really depressed before I went in the summer, and I filled out this little ""get to know me"" type thing where you put down some things your struggling with so the councilors can try and help you. My parent's didn't read the chart, so I put down depression and suicidal thoughts.  get there, and on the very first night, right before bed, my councilor pulls me outside in the dark, hugs me tight and says ""It's all going to be ok. I promise you'll be ok."" he didn't even know me yet.  last night came along, and we have a very emotional worship, with great music and a powerful message. That was the first time in a very long time I felt truly happy, free, and with God. It was amazing. It was a euphoria. On the last day my councilor came up and hugged me again and said ""I believe in you Athena. tay with us, and come back to see me next year."" and it was the most gut wrenching thing.  week I got a pre-written letter from my councilor and it was a reminder to keep fighting. It's supposed to be a half-way mark between camp sessions. I cried.  forward to tonight, I was standing in the bathroom with Tylenol in my hand, ready to end it. o much has happened and I was so close. My last thought before I downed the pills was ""But my councilor. I would let her down. I need to see her again, and show her I made it."" and so I put the pills far away and now I'm here, sobbing, wishing I had her phone number. I've re read the letter so many times.

I really didn't want to use my main account to post this.  can't sleep. I figured, what the hell. What's the harm in ranting about this, even if no one reads it? grandfather just passed away recently. We weren't close and he never really gave a shit about me when I was a kid. I really resented him for that but now I understand why. He had severe depression. He'd been living alone for half of his life and pushed most of his family members away. He acted as though my mom and her brother had abandoned him and didn't respect him enough. Near the end he found out he had cancer. He died in the hospital, after not being properly looked after. In his last 24 hours, my mom attempted to cheer him up. he kept saying that he would get through this and that this is just a bump in the road. His response was, ""then what?""  come to understand a lot about why he was so weird now that he's gone. He was a very miserable person, yet he seemed content to just live in his misery. The way he would lash out, and accuse his kids of abandoning him, reminds me of that irrational state of mind I sometimes enter. When there's this little feeling urging me to just believe that no one really cares for me, and how it would be so much easier to just end it.  also come to what feels like a horrifying realization. Am I doomed to end up like my grandfather? Miserable, bitter, with no one by my side? Is it inevitable that I will push everyone I love away from me and cry once I realize what I've done? And the one I truly hate thinking about: was I born to be a walking social disease that eats away at all my attempted relationships? Was I born to suffer, or born to make the people around me miserable? don't know how much longer I can live like this. And even when I say that I don't really know what it means. I'm not going to kill myself. I could never bring myself to do that. I don't want to die, truly, I just want to never have been. I feel so bad for the people that care about me. It's like I can't help but cause everyone around me pain. I have this sinking feeling in my gut that in the end, it doesn't really matter because eventually they will all despise me for what a relationship with me put them through.  do have a boyfriend. I love him very much. ometimes those feelings are numb and I just want to give into the aching feeling and I can't bring myself to show affection. There will be issues with our sex life, him going out in public with me (I have really bad social anxiety, yay), me meeting his family. He is far from depressed, he has his struggles of course and I want to help with them, but I don't think he will ever truly understand why I can't even find the motivation to watch the movies I want to see, or learn how to drive, or find employment. He tries to understand, but I just don't think it's possible for him to. I feel guilty. I feel like I'm going to leave him with a scar and I can't even help it. I'm his first girlfriend. What a horrible first girlfriend to deal with, right? He loves me, I know he does. ometimes it just feels like he loves a version of me that exists only in his head. And I'm honest with him about how I think my negative thoughts work too. I've tried telling him the signs to look out for. Like, when I start talking like this, please don't listen. Please just stay with me. Reassure me. But I think it just confuses him. I sent him an article about how to cope with an O that has depression. It was the only tool I could think of. He appreciated me sending it, but when I referenced one of the things to look out for in the article, he just said that it, ""wasn't magic."" Meaning I guess that's what it would take to deal with me. This would be such a good relationship if only I wasn't this way. I feel damaged and useless. I cry every time I think about this relationship failing over factors I can't handle.  don't know what to do. I try to be open about suicidal thoughts, and being in a really down state, but I never feel truly supported. I wish someone would just persist, and listen, and tell me it's ok. It's not a cure but wish someone would try. No one ever has. Even when I try to mention that's what I need. Maybe it's an unreasonable amount of dedication to expect. I don't know.  lost. Maybe it's not myself that I hate, I just loathe the depression and what it tries to warp me into. What do I do? Is there anything to do? I've tried 3 different antidepressants, and none of them did anything, I only experienced the negative side effects. I'm hoping to start a new one soon. I've been through multiple therapists, and didn't really feel any progress, but I contacted another and made an appointment for next month. I guess I just need to keep hoping. It feels like that's all there's left to do. But I don't know how much I have left.  you read all of this, thank you. I just want to feel like I'm not alone in fighting this disease.

Like, normal married couples that start a normal ‚Äúnuclear family‚Äù baffle me. is probably because my dad died when I was an infant and my mother never remarried. o all I ever knew was a woman being a single ‚Äúworking‚Äù mother (even though she just inherited my dad‚Äôs company when he died and then let his employees run the business for her and she just sat at home every day watching the Lifetime movie network and ordering clothes off the home shopping network). My mother didn‚Äôt set an example as far as dating or marriage. Or working. I struggle with being a normal adult (maintaining a job and getting married and seem hard to me.) And the whole having kids thing seems weird to me because my mother convinced me that having kids is a bad idea and she‚Äôs even told me multiple times that she wishes she hadn‚Äôt had kids.  haven‚Äôt spoken to my mother in 4 years because she‚Äôs a very cold, miserable woman plus she‚Äôs made up really disgusting lies about me. my mother told me not to get married as well. my mother has really fucked me up in the head and I‚Äôm probably gonna die alone. I‚Äôll never marry or have kids like the normal people do.Baffled by married couples with kids",1635388400,1731,321

depression,"Anonymous account because I just need to get this out. This is very difficult for me to say and I'm already meeting with my physician to get advice on this too. I just don't want to get told again to be on a medication without really figuring out why I'm like this. Let me explain: I had a meeting with my boss, and I felt like such an idiot not being able to answer some basic algebra questions that he was asking me. I was a math honors student in college and a very high achieving one at that...but I looked like an idiot in front of my boss. I couldn't figure out why I froze when he asked me to do some simple calculations. ome context, I am in a high position at this company and I'm in charge of a design team for a software development company.  the past couple of years, I realized that I am undiagnosed bipolar. I wasn't fully sure about it until I recently watched the episode of Modern Love where Anne Hathaway's character suffers from bipolar disorder and it affects her daily life so much that it's crippling. I saw this episode and I couldn't help but realize I was just like her. I had the same highs and lows that she went through, all the way to the timing, unable to get off the couch, feeling no joy or excitement, and then feeling so amazing that everything in life is amazing and awesome. omething I should mention is that I have a very severe anxiety disorder that has me lingering with anxiety every day, when I wake up, sleep, do anything. It's like a low-lying disease that's always there just waiting to act up when there's a loud noise, stressful situation, someone yelling, etc. It's not as bad as it used to be, but I almost had a heart attack when I was 18 if that helps you understand how bad it used to be. trying so hard to not have these mood swings affect my life, and they aren't as severe as Anne Hathaway's were, so I can fake it pretty well in daily life...but when someone puts me on the spot and expects me to be able to think quick and be my normal sharp self, I freeze and look like a clueless idiot. It's embarrassing.  really thinking about this, I realize that I've felt like my mind is in the clouds for weeks. I don't feel present, and even when I'm talking to people, doing what I love, driving around, eating out with my wife or friends, I just feel like I left part of myself somewhere and I can't remember where I left it. I'm getting less and less present with reality and I just want to love life again. I want to feel like my mind and body are connected. I have a very fast-paced lifestyle, and I have several focuses and careers so I never run out of things to do, but I don't work more than 50 hours a week. I feel burned out, but it's not because of my work but rather I'm exhausted being myself.  wife is very supportive and she tells me that she supports whatever decisions I want to take to help my mental health, including encouraging me after I told her I called my physician to get some professional advice on where I should go to address this, to a therapist, psychologist, etc. guess I'm posting here on Reddit because I just don't want to feel alone or feel like this issue isn't just me. I know there are many others out there that are going through something just like this, who love life but don't feel present, and I would love to know how you deal with it.Really wish I knew what it was like to not feel cloudy all the time",1635387800,3396,653

depression,"There was this girl I had a huge crush on all throughout high school. We often had classes together, she was always the smartest and prettiest girl but quite shy. I never made a move but always made a conscious effort to be friendly and smile when around her. I never really got the feeling she was into me though.  senior year a different girl and I had started to hit it off and I decided I'd give it a chance to try to get my mind off my crush. We dated for 6 moths but I never was fully committed to it. Vividly I remember seeing my crush post a cute picture on her story. I sat there all night thinking about her and only days later broke up with my girlfriend. When we broke up I told her and my friends it was because I liked the other girl. This was the first time I'd ever told anyone about my feelings for her. omehow word got to her about my feelings but I was far to scared to say anything and again nothing came of it.  months I'd still constantly think about her even as college soon came nearer. I went to school out of state and she stayed in state so I really, really didn't think it would ever work out. For the first semester of college I hung out with a few different girls. Finally after essentially having a mental breakdown at a party I made my way back to my room and cried for hours thinking of my crush who I couldn't at all let go of. For the next week I really sat on and thought about what to do. Winter break was only a few weeks away and I decided to shoot my shot.  texted her asking if she'd like to go out on for dinner when we both came back for break. To my astonishment she said of course and even put a heart by it. I should have saw something when she followed up saying It would kinda tough because her parents were worried about covid but I thought nothing of it and was the happiest I'd ever been for the  weeks before break.  first Friday night back home followed up and asked her out for dinner the next evening. he said no. I sensed something was up and asked her if she was even interested at all. he responded saying she didn't see how it would work out. I texted back telling her that I genuinely really liked her and had for years but understood that she might not feel the same. I wished her the best for her future and told her what I wanted most was that she was happy. he didn't respond.  weeks I was absolutely crushed. I'd sit stay at home alone all day and go drive by myself at night. I made no attempt to hangout with my friends all break. When it came time back to go to college I decided to stay at home with my Dad for the semester and do my classes online and work with him at our family business. The long work weeks, school load, and being away from other people my age had really helped me make a turn for better as I was so busy I could keep my mind off her to some extent. early morning I felt the urge to say something and texted her to ask why she had said yes in the first place. he responded saying she didn't want to hurt my feelings and didn't think we'd ever actually go out. I left it at that and haven't reached out sense. Time passed, summer came and went, and Ive been back at college now for the fall semester. I don't ever go out, instead I focus hard on my studies and have become an avid reader. ince being rejected I've radically changed my diet and exercise routine in an attempt to be my best self as well.  still think about her all the time with this constant flicker of hope in the back of my mind that I still have a chance. Part of me thinks its meant to be since I've never moved on but that's likely wishful thinking. I haven't ever really liked the school I've been at and have my reservations about how good of a school it is and recently decided to transfer to state school to get a better education and be with my old friends. I know that I've let my feelings known and at this point it's really just a waiting game. I still talk to my friends about it occasionally to try and cope with it to little avail. I don't know what the future holds and accept it's in God's hands but everynight as I fall asleep I can't help but think about her.Just another guy who can't get over a girl who rejected her... what do I do",1635387532,4209,836
depression,I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever done anything for myself except get out of the way. I hate being around people and I can‚Äôt talk to people without feeling like an ass.

They literally avoided me for an entire day and I had to fake an apology so they could move on already. I feel like I‚Äôve just weighed down the lives of ever around me. For all of grade school I was never included in anything. I was always the odd man out. Just in the background. It was the same thing in high school. I‚Äôve always done well in school but I‚Äôm not good at anything else. Everything I‚Äôve tried I‚Äôve failed in and I just want to give up.

I recently had a bit of a ""falling out"" with a best friend and he's been a little bit more distant with me because he's trying to live his life \~ and I'm trying to be happy for him, but he used to be the one that helped fill this void of loneliness when my husband was at work since he can't be on his phone at work. With that being said, I feel like I developed some sort of happiness bond to the attention I was getting. Now with that void of space that was once filled, it just really hurts. I've dealt with this kind of mental stress back when I was younger. I never truly had friends until I was 18 since everyone avoided the living hell outta me in school (not to mention my abusive parents are a whole 'nother trauma). Gaming helped me meet my husband and obviously my work helped me meet my group of friends.. o I should at least be happy about that? Thankful maybe? But even with that, it just feels so empty. I feel like a nuisance reaching out to my friends about my mental health problems. I feel like I'm going to stress my husband even more out than he already is. He asks me constantly if I'm okay, what's wrong, etc. I tell him I'm not okay and I don't know what's wrong. I just can't put what I'm feeling into words. I can't explain why I feel this depressed. I just don't understand. On my way home today, I accidentally crashed the back of my car into a wall because I heavily zoned out because of everything that's going on inside my head. I cried hard. I was so shaken. I've never gotten engulfed in my negative thoughts like that behind a wheel to the point where I'm paralyzed in motion. I just hate being me. I hate feeling like this. I want to be okay, but I don't know how.Existing is just getting harder",1635383106,2775,539
depression,"o I don't know how to really explain this well but I'll try to.. since my dad has passed away two months ago, it's opened my eyes a lot to the people around me. I almost completely kicked my best friend out of my life bc she felt the ps4 was more important than my dad dying. he was upset bc I had been distant and not online playing video games, so she makes a public post saying she'll leave social media bc ""no one"" will talk to her. The only reason I hadn't texted was bc I finally got myself to fall asleep; I was afraid to bc I just kept having nightmares or thinking about waking up to news that my dad had passed. knew very well about everything but still posted that. After I confronted her, telling her he had little chances of surviving and that his organs were shutting down she immediately switched up her attitude. Ever since that moment I've just changed.  no longer feel the urge to talk to my friends. It's not like I WANT to lose them either but I also don't want to talk to them. I just want to be alone. There's a select few, very select few who I actually feel perfectly fine talking to or spending time with them: my boyfriend, my best friend Trent, and my brother. Other than them, I don't have a desire to call, text, or play games with other people.  don't hate them, I don't feel like I'm doing it out of depression, I just.. Don't want to. I don't want to talk or hangout with them, but I feel like a horrible person for feeling this way bc they're just being good friends, you know?Wanting to be alone but not sad?",1635383027,1542,299

I have had plentiful career counseling with my college. I had one job in substance abuse counseling earlier this year that was far too challenging and turbulent that I had to leave. I do not have a clinical license yet. Job listings are pretty sparse for counseling jobs. Jobs in my area either want years of experience or a clinical license.

I honestly do enjoy it, atleast when I know what I am doing, or atleast have a good idea on what I am doing, but the truth is, that even 3 years into this 4 year course, I barely understand what I am doing and it's really starting to dawn on me, that even if I do finish and get a degree I am not going to be able to produce anything that will earn me even a small amount of money. really don't think I am smart enough to create my own project that could potentially make me some money, meaning I could be spending years working the same kind of job where I make next to no money and hate my life moreso than I usually do, all while spending my free time working on projects that will probably never be good enough to be a main source of income for me. of this is forgetting that I am still single at 26 and the only person I have met that seemed to be interested in me I ruined my chances with years ago, that I don't even have my own home or my own car or anything worth noting besides my useless degree that I am never going to use. I've decided that once I graduate I will kill myself after a year, assuming I'm not offered a job in my field when I finish my course which honestly seems like the most likely outcome, I mean if I am honest I didn't come back expecting it at all. The year being the time I give myself to produce something that gives me atleast a little hope that I could make a living. All while almost certainly working the same awful jobs I came back to uni in order to avoid.Decided I am gonna commit suicide a year after I graduate.",1635377726,2124,427

depression, I divorced my wife about almost 2 years ago and clearly still think about her. We were together for 14 years and what at that time felt like the right choice ended up to be a mistake. he's moved on and I am very happy for her. My healing journey somehow has rather been sporadic and reading through the 5 stages of grief there are currently described as: Denial and isolation (reject the idea that it could be true) Anger (frustration and a feeling of unfairness) Bargaining (trying to change the grief or seeking a replacement) Depression (sadness and bearing full responsibility) Acceptance (to come to terms) understand grief is a very personal experience and everyone grieves in their own way. The 5 stages have been put forward by experts. personally don't feel like my grieving experience has followed these 5 stages. I think I went through: Ignoring my feelings (did not think about my breakup at all - used various methods to numb the pain) Acceptance (I knew there wasn't going to be a second chance) Depression (where I am now) anyone been through those 5 stages or do you feel like your grieving experience was a bit more 'random' like mine.The 5 Stages of Grief,1635376778,1174,207

depression,"Recently dropped out from college (I'm 19) after struggling to stay there for 3 weeks. Hated the people, the atmosphere, the long classes, the field of study - everything. Everyday I refused to go to sleep just to go through all this shit again and so I snapped. Decided to find a job instead. Actually found one, finished my 2 day schooling and well...I fucking hate it there and feel like quitting. Unfortunately that's an immediate death sentence for me and I'm stuck feeling extremely disappointed with life because of it. I also had a falling out with my best friend and I fail to feel like trying to make up with him. I don't really want to talk with my remaining friends either.

depression,"i have been through a lot more than I give myself credit for. grew up with three older brothers in a nice home, thought we had everything. I was really young and didn‚Äôt understand what was happening but my dad lost his job and entered a legal battle where he faced potential life in prison. The trial went on for years but he was able to prove his innocence. My dad is a smart man but he he always struggled with alcoholism and substance abuse. when I was in 5th grade our house got flooded in a superstorm and we had to live with random people for a few months until settling at my grandmas house for a year and a half. During this time my oldest brother (who was a senior in high school) was dealing with a lot of issues (to this day don‚Äôt really know what, drugs girls idk) but he would lash out in anger towards my dad and scare my mom and i,  breaking things, throwing things, kicking windows off cars, bricks through windows. The police came to my house every week until my dad decided to get a restraining order on him. I didn‚Äôt see him for two years and  he is back in my life now and we have bonded but I think this is a part of my worth mentioning as it shows my dads parenting style and i think it has affected me. It‚Äôs around this time i started dealing with panic attacks (uncontrollable crying unable to breathe) and I remember so many occasions my dad hitting me or smacking me because i was hysterical. I even remember thinking my dad was having an affair , and it drove me CRAZY. I remember seeing porn on his work iPad  that i played games on.. other random things that may seem fine to some people but this changed my view on him. this year he walked out on us. He literally packed a duffel bag and left. I learned that he did have an emotional relationship with a Woman through texting , and though it wasn‚Äôt the entire reason for his leaving I think it‚Äôs interesting that i sensed this and it affected me so much. For years of my childhood i harnessed a lot o hatred and distrust for my father. He left on my moms birthday. he was crying and didnt want him to leave. It was such a shock, I genuinely never thought my dad would leave. It was in these past few years that we finally moved into a house, he was commuting to NYC and he has been sober since after being relocated from the storm. My dad was the one person that actually gave me advice and even though he hit me as a kid and said a lot of horrible things to me when he was not in the right headspace i respected him for getting sober  and for guiding me through life. The day he left (moms bday) was this March, and he must have had a girlfriend this whole time because he‚Äôs been living with a woman since before they even signed the papers. I have just felt so alone my whole life. I‚Äôm the only girl in my family (three older brothers ) and due to my gender and the age difference I really did grow up by myself.  Nobody ever sat  me down and explained what was happening , not about the restraining order on my own brother which I didn‚Äôt understand why he couldn‚Äôt come by, very vivid memories of that, also my first time cutting myself was in 5th grade with rusty scissors. My dad held me and told me it‚Äôs okay, that people do it sometimes when they‚Äôre upset but it‚Äôs not the way to make these feelings go away. He gave me neosporin and patched me up. I am getting emotional writing this because I have such a hard time understanding the state of my family and how different everything is now. When he lost his job and we lost the house, i was the one to discover that he was drinking again. My brothers all have complicated relationships with him and I don‚Äôt blame them, he wasnt sober for a majority of their lives and has put immense pressure on them in various aspects of their life. My mom is not emotional , or even very loving for that matter. I have memories of crying into her breasts and she will let me, but it‚Äôs not like she offers loving words or even physical affection if any kind. she gives the worst advice and I hate feeling like I ‚Äúside‚Äù with my dad because I‚Äôm not taking a side, but I understand why he left sometimes. I HATE feeling this way. My dad tells me that I have to go to school and start a career so I don‚Äôt ‚Äúend up like her‚Äù. And that pisses me of frankly because he made her believe she would be a stay at home mom so it‚Äôs not really her fault that he decided to leave well into their 50s. o anyway, since my dad left and my brothers are all old and out of the house, I have been the only one here to help her clean , hold her when she cries, offer loving words and help. he relies on medication like Xanax to ‚Äúmake her feel better‚Äù and is so negative it‚Äôs hard for me to keep an upbeat attitude. I‚Äôm 19 and my hair is falling out from the stress of this move. My mom and I have to pack up this entire house (it sold and we have to be moved out in a few weeks) and she doesn‚Äôt even have a place yet. I have no idea where I‚Äôm going to be living and I pushed myself away from all my friends. I had a boyfriend (or I guess still have , I don‚Äôt know it‚Äôs been really bad these past few weeks )  for almost a year. He has been here with me through it all but he doesn‚Äôt trust me. He is the type to read redpill and think all girls are whores. He doesn‚Äôt trust me at all and brings so much stress into my life by telling me I‚Äôm not a good girlfriend and don‚Äôt show him love , etc. I feel like a monster. I am not trying to make excuses but I haven‚Äôt had the best role models when it comes to showing love and I‚Äôm going through a lot right now. I have made mistakes in our relationship but I‚Äôve always been loyal and real with him. I had to block him on everything today because the insults he has been throwing at me are making me want to hurt myself and I‚Äôve been clean for over a month now. I guess it‚Äôs finally hitting me that I‚Äôm alone. I wish I could talk to my mom, and I wish I had a relationship with my brothers. Lord knows I have tried . It‚Äôs hard when you grow up in a house and don‚Äôt understand what love is. My dad knows exactly what to say to guide me and help me feel better but he‚Äôs low key a sociopath. On top of this I have a lot of insecurities about my appearance but that doesn‚Äôt really matter I guess. I have this horrible fear of being left, that all guys watch porn and always check other girls out. I have always been such a Romantic. I play guitar and sing it‚Äôs the one thing that brings me peace of mind. And I can‚Äôt help but think I will never find someone that only wants me, only looks at me, will never leave me. I feel crazy for feeling like I need that, but I just want to be enough for someone. The day my dad left I realized I had to parent my mom the way she never parented me , she even said to me ‚Äúall my kids left me, you‚Äôre going to leave me one day too‚Äù and it is the reason i have stuck around close to home and not gone away to school. I‚Äôm a sharp person and a hard worker , I‚Äôm saving my money because right now we share a car so when she‚Äôs at work I‚Äôm stuck at home in this house full of boxes, this house i never wanted to move to that my dad settled us in and left us in. it breaks my heart to hear her say constantly that she wishes she would die in her sleep, I feel that way too, and have nobody to express it to. ometimes I can‚Äôt even pin point my emotions or what is best for me. o here I am posting on Reddit, a fucking novel because there is officially no boyfriend for me to run to to make me feel better. It‚Äôs just me and I don‚Äôt know if I can do this anymore.  I wish everyday for something to happen to me, and I hate myself for being so selfish but the pain is never ending. I don‚Äôt post on Instagram out of insecurity and honesty I ducked myself over with that because people forget you exist when you don‚Äôt use napchat, Instagram Twitter whatever. I have reached out to friends , but they are too caught up in their own lives and many of them are happy and enjoying their early teenage years and I don‚Äôt want to take that from them. I just know I deserve happiness , I know I‚Äôm a good person and I feel so lost. I love my boyfriend so much but he has destroyed my self esteem. He says something good and then takes it back and insults me. I don‚Äôt know how to trust. I didn‚Äôt to begin with , and now I‚Äôm alone. I guess this is how I am meant to be. In a fight  not too long ago he told me ‚ÄúI knew you were not worth it from the start‚Äù ‚ÄúGet ready to sleep alone for the rest of your life‚Äù ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not what I want, you used to be‚Äù ‚Äúyou‚Äôre going to die alone‚Äù it‚Äôs just fucking me up because he‚Äôs right. I feel like nobidy will ever love me , just me . Mistakes , emotional trauma and all. I just feel like a monster , I‚Äôm so lost and need direction19F extremely lost",1635375825,8735,1762

depression,"Idk how to begin this. Basically back in early 2020 I was excited for the first time in a long time about life and my future. I was months away from graduating, was working part time making steady money, and was surrounded be people who loved me. Then February 2020 a bombshell dropped on me when I found out my part time job was forced to lay me off due to the position being eliminated. I was bummed out but figured, hey, I'm graduating in three months so I'll have no problem finding a nice job soon. o I took the severance package and focused on my senior project at University. Covid hit, but it didn't affect me until after I graduated. I started immediately looking for jobs. Nada. No replies no calls back no nothing. I started applying at call centers, nothing. Data entry jobs,nothing. By October I was depressed as fuck and decided I needed money bad so I applied at target. I was hired at target and belittled by coworkers who picked on me for being in my twenties and having a degree but still working retail. The HR lady treated me like trash as well so I walked out and quit in early November. From then till now I've bounced around job to job eventually leaving them all. I have a decently successful online business that allows me to pay the bills but it is very boom or bust and I'm always constantly stressed that I won't have enough money at the end of the month. I'm probably spending between 50-60 hours a week on it just trying to make it work. I am bitter and angry at the world and I feel like I've been left behind.  I wonder if  it's even worth living if the rest of my life is going to be like this. I feel dead inside, void of any and all happiness. The days bleed together. Birthdays, holidays, dinners at restaurants, walks, exercise, anything just seems trite and meaningless. I am still applying for work and just the past six months I've probably applied for sixty plus jobs. I haven't been applying for retail/food service work because I have a degree and I cannot fathom working the fucking drive thru after working my ass off for four years. I just feel like going to be and never waking up again.Been a bad few years",1635373967,2154,403
depression,"o I have been taking Antidepressants for some months now and my life has been objectively better. Work has been less stressful, I have been less anxious in social situations and have felt generally more at peace with myself. Hurray for science! just like the saying goes 'you only know what you have once you lose it', so has my recovery from depression made me fully reflect on all the things that it gave me. And, as it turned out, I was apparently quite attached to some of these things.  as: being (probably overly) ambitious, ability to very intensively listen to music and most importantly: feeling special. something that, now looking back at it, I wasn't fully admitting to myself. The depression was not only causing my misery, but was also in a weird way the only thing that I was able to hang onto. 'At least    I' m special because I'm clinically depressed' would be a thought I would very often have and was a way that I could cope with all of the misery I was feeling at that time. not that I want to go back to the old miserable me just to feel special again, I much prefer being the happy average Joe from next door. But admitting that, to become a better person, you sometimes have to let go of the things you are most attached to (Almost like an addiction now that I'm thinking about it) is a very important and surprising lesson I learned and wanted to share.  anyone had the same or similar experiences?

depression,"I think I have a problem, and one that would ask me where I lost so much time in my life shortening unnecessarily, without touching anything significant, choosing me only with bundles of information that are of no use to me and do not determine me. to discover more, I do not arouse my curiosity, it only exists in my mind because I chose to implant them there, because I imposed a certain state and I tried to simulate feelings of interest towards a certain thing in moments when I didn't feel interest in anything, of pleasure when it seemed natural for me to like someone, making self-suggestion to the point where I had the illusion that I really feel that, but now, after so many years, I remained discovered. I realized how well I could lie to myself, avoiding the real problems in my life, that I don't know how to do anything, that I don't feel any passion for anything, and that nothing seems to draw my attention to development. The only thing I can do is absorb the information as such, the thought that I might catch it causing a feeling of anxiety and panic, I can't explain why. I forced myself over time into identities and said that I wanted to do something, only that I was doing it because I had the impression that it would make me feel better. I participated in middle school and high school competitions to fill a gap that required the desire for validation out of abundance, and when a framework called pre-university education ended and I landed in the real world, where you now learn something because it attracts you by itself, not just as a competition tool, not for some grades. I'm at a decent university, I'm studying biochemistry, the program is ok, but I don't feel passion or desire to study. I repeat, I do not hate, but my brain does not think about the future, I do not see something that I like on any level: social, professional, personal, etc. and that motivates me. I try to watch documentary videos to find out different information, but nothing arouses my curiosity, I take the information as such at best as if someone were telling me that his car is black. I say at best because I often struggle to remember what happened in a series, what he said in a video, and I have this problem even with those I interact with: I ask him 5 times to I explain some things because I forget unusually quickly and I force myself to make connections between events. o, I feel a little disconnected, and a little worried that I might have a mental problem with concentration or memory. I couldn't bring myself what I ate for lunch today, and I thought it was too much. I have been reproached for not making connections and for not being able to concentrate, and I am beginning to be ashamed to ask too many times because at some point I know that my interlocutor will get angry. Thus, my friends built their passions, they found their favorite artists, while I lived in the illusion of a finished competition and I seem to know that I had enough time for everything, but I did not capitalize on it properly, now I feel tired and I feel that if I take the wrong step I will have a panic attack. I'm behind with a lot of information about my friends, who have universal and contemporary culture, and I talk about various topics, and I look at them confused, because the truth is that I listen to music and I don't relate to the lyrics, I watch series and not I relate to the characters, sometimes I have to force myself to keep my attention there. o I could call myself an uncultured swine, without emotions and passions, living through vital functions and that's about it.

My parents have always said I can talk to them but when I do I am met with passive aggressive judgement. My older sister has two kids that my parents are absolutely infatuated with and that is fine. My problem is that my accomplishments and good news are always met with comparisons to the grandchildren. Am I being selfish for not wanting to hear about the grandkids and talk about my life?

depression,"Long story short, about 3 years ago I found myself at literally rock bottom. I hated myself more than anyone else, hated the world for feeling that way and felt abandoned and betrayed by everyone even when it wasn't like that at all. My brain kept lying to me and I listened to all of those lies, believing them fully. I still have trouble with believing every single thing my mind tells me, even when logically I know that it's wrong. All that emotional struggle made me abuse alcohol like never before. I thought it would be fine, that nothing would happen to me as long as I'd be careful not to OD and end up in the hospital. I turned into someone I never thought I'd be. I was so awful to my friends and said things I always regretted when I was sober. I always said I would stop drinking, but I'd just do it over and over again. Nowadays I'm not drinking as much anymore, I stay sober most of the time but it feels like a living hell. I feel like I'm never at peace, I'm always unhappy about everything and I can't find reasons to enjoy life. My memory has become awful as well, I used to be a good student, now I have to read things over and over again and I still can't remember them properly. I think alcohol has messed up my brain permanently, unfortunately. The cravings never went away either, whenever I get the chance to have alcohol, I have to go overboard with it and have too much. I feel like it's the only thing that makes me feel good anymore, which is really sad, but no matter how much I try, I can't change it. If you ever think that alcohol will help you, I can assure you that it won't. It will make everything worse. If you're not addicted to alcohol, please don't ever start. Don't ever try it. Try to find joy in anything else, in something that won't mess with your brain chemistry. Anything else is better than addictionExcessive alcohol use messed up my brain forever",1635370218,1897,360

That was until more recently... starters, myself and the man I have loved for about 3ish years have seriously started thinking about our future together, I recently secured a volunteering position at a ww1 museum (after a complete chance encounter mind you, I ended up stumbling upon it while exploring in the woods lol) and the mental health team im working with right now are helping me set up my CV so i can find work and maybe enroll in a course. Everything is finally turning around for me very quickly and changing for the better. I'm finally getting to where I want to be in life... so why am I filled with this awful sense of dread? I should be happy (and in many ways, I am), but I just want to run away and hide. I want to cry, I'm miserable and scared and even though I'm being hit with all these positives and steps forward, it doesnt feel right for me to feel this way. I keep trying to imagine my ideal future, something I have dreamed about time and time again and something I am getting closer and closer to achieving and now I dont want it. Why? All I wanted was a normal, productive life and now I'm wishing the universe would take all these oppurtunities back. I don't want them is severely wrong.... not sure what to do, obviously I'll bring this up to the mental health team I'm seeing, but I want to know what other people might have to say, any ideas why this is happening? Has anyone experienced something similar? I really need some advice right nowEverything is going great, so why do I feel this way?",1635366739,1974,364

depression,One thing I hate about depression is the lack motivation that's probably my least favorite thing about this (not that there is a favorite thing when it comes to depression) anytime I do something that would benefit me but yet its productive (like school work or cleaning my room or working out ect...) I get so mad because my brain is like fuck no go lay in bed or something and then I get so pissed about the fact it makes me mad for no reason and I start wanting to cry then I just go do something else. I just want to do something that normal people do everyday with no problem I feel like that's not so hard to ask but my brain/mind doesn't care about my opinion. I force myself sometimes but its so hard for no reasonDoing productive things makes me angry and emotional,1635366452,774,148
depression,"I need just one best friend, someone that understands and shares things with me, like someone that gets my type of humor and wants to pass most of the time with me. It's really hard to find someone like this, they all always talk to me when they need something and they all grew up, they don't want to have fun anymore, or at least not in my way, their type of fun is by talking, with jokes, gossip.I tried making some paper airplanes but my classmates destroy them, my teacher enjoys them, he even said to decorate them but my classmates surely don't like them.. however I didn't care really much, after all I was making it flying alone, not with someone, if I had a friend I would've done more than a paper airplane, I would've have fun in the most stupid ways and we would've play videogames togheter.  feel so alone, no one needs me. I asked for advices from my old online friends who are no longer my friends they always said that some day I would've been happy, but I'm waiting for that day from like 2 years, nothing happened, I'm so bored and have nothing to live for, the only place I can be happy is in my imagination and when I sleepI think I might be too immature and I feel incredibly lonely",1635366440,1204,230

Anyway, The prescriber keeps increasing my dosage of this specific type of medication but I've a feeling the meds haven't been really working as well. Also, the meds don't target the specific problem I have(lack of concentration and focus). I told them this but they keep suggesting to increase my dosage. I have asked that I change medication because this one isn't working as well. They're reasoning is that I used to take these meds a few years back and that other meds might not work. However, I told them several times that the meds I'm on now are not working to fix the main problem. Which is my lack of focus. want to know is this common practice? Would I be overreacting if I request a different prescriber? they did increased the dosage and now I can't sleep due to these pills.

depression,"We met earlier this year back in February, through a mutual friend, and became extremely close due to mutual hobby (music festival) I am an introvert with a small circle of friends. He‚Äôs an extrovert and is very popular, has hundred of friends. of the large number of friends he has, we somehow have a very very good connection and we used to hang out/chat almost everyday for hours. We used to spend nights and nights at music festivals and party, get drunk, get wasted together. I‚Äôd say we sit just right above best friends and a little bit under lovers (he has a partner). hit, we can‚Äôt rave, eat out, or catchup. Then I went through depression a few months back (still recovering) due to some issues with work. I got busy, depressed and withdrawn from social interactions. Our conversations turned into ‚Äúhow are you today‚Äù ‚Äúi‚Äôm good‚Äù and eventually died out. It‚Äôs been like that for a few months now and we sort of stopped talking and stopped hanging out. loss of interest in friendship and connection between me and him sort of killed a part of me. He‚Äôs nothing less than an amazing friend to me and I try my best to connect with him while also navigating through a dark period in my life. Things are not improving on my end, but mentally I am better than I was before. I found out that he‚Äôs going through depression as well, hence the reason why he‚Äôs also withdrawn from social interactions. Not only with me, but with other people. And this has gotten me concerned. a caring, friendly and easy going guy, hence he has a large circle of friends. He used to organise catchups, host parties, look after people, care and listen to their issues, big or small. But for some reasons he feels as though all the efforts he put in are not reciprocated. He feels as though people would do catchups and hangouts and not invite him. His mutual friends would do things together but not invite him. He feels excluded and invisible. His friends would come to his events when they‚Äôre invited, but when they do organise something they never invite him. Because of this, it‚Äôs put a dent in his mind, in his point of view, he thinks a lot of people come to him because they‚Äôre superficial. They want something from him but never give back. Now that is something I don‚Äôt know, because in my eyes, he‚Äôs a popular friend, he‚Äôs well loved and well respected. But of course, I cannot speak for him because I don‚Äôt know what he‚Äôs going through. I try my best to tell him how great of a person he is, because I genuinely feel that way, in a hope that he would cheer up. tried to check in on him, asked him if things are ok, he said things are fine, but never opened up any further. I respect that boundary, but I wish he would open up to me and I wish I could help him more. I know I didn‚Äôt reach out to him enough, and that I‚Äôm not a good enough friend and I can‚Äôt use my own depression as a shield. I know I‚Äôm still in a shit place but I want to be strong and help him and carry him out of his dark place.  planning to catch up with him this weekend, I want to do something together with him and tell him how much I care for him and that he can always open up with me. I‚Äôm just scared, because we haven‚Äôt talked a lot and sometimes even when we catch up, we don‚Äôt have anything to say to each other. help me help him. I would like to make the catch up chillaxing, meaningful, I would like to reconnect and have that bond in our friendship again. What activities should we do? What topic should we talk about? I‚Äôm 100% willing to open up with him, but it‚Äôs difficult when he‚Äôs not open up with me.My (28M) friend (in his 40s) is going through depression, but will not open up",1635364499,3656,695

depression,"i've been going to therapy since december 2020 - june 2021. i quit treatment this summer because i went on holiday and i knew i'd feel better immediatly in a different environment (mothercountry) because that has always been the case ever since i was a child. survival mode from august until summer, then my family would take me to our country during the summer and every time we came back i was a different person, literally had teachers write to my mom asking what happend during the summer and that i'm completely different person. a lot happier but of course that happiness lasted a few months after coming back, then sadness all over again. this summer didn't go as expected, lots of family issues, went through a lot of stress and traumatic experiences in such a short period of time, so when i came back i was absolutely numb. started in college, and just after a month it started going downhill again, and decided to contact the same therapist. two weeks ago we had our first session after a while, it went okay, today i went back for a second session and it didn't go well. he basically gave up on me and told me to find another therapist that can help me. i didn't even ask why, i just said okay and left. i'm assuming it's because i didn't do the homework he expected me to do after our first session. i'm really sick of being stuck in this cycle. i live in a country where there is bad weather all the time, and even though i was born here and lived all my life here, i just can't thrive in this weather or society. i felt all the same in high school and i have no idea how i pushed through and graduated. i just can't see myself doing this in college. i have no energy or motivation. i feel tired and exhausted all the time. and passive/numb. i show up and i don't even want to try to be social. just waiting for the classes to finish so i can go home and lay in my bed. and this feeling is getting worse now that winter is approaching. i can't see myself thriving at any work place either. just the fact that i have to be ''active'' every day, sleep early and wake up early, when i can't sleep until it's 5 or 6 am in the morning. everything in me wants to give up and i would if i didn't live with my family. my mom has already been through this with me once, during my gap year, didn't go to school or work either, winter depression was the worst i've ever experienced and i feel like it's all coming back now. i feel like such a failure and it's hard watching everyone around me thrive when i don't and i don't know why. this has been with me all my life, but i managed to do it. i got through middle school. high school. but i just can't anymore. i do not have a supportive family. tried to get help everywhere i could. doctor. therapy. school counselor and everything they offer at the school. but after today with my therapist, i just realized nobody can help me and that's the worst of all. i wouldn't seek help if i knew how to help myself. can't describe how awful it feels to be struggling and there is no real help anywhere. and honestly, i feel so shit that my therapist gave up on me. feels like a big ''this girl can't be saved'' kinda thing, which doesn't help in seeing how it'll get better. idk what the problem is either. i just know i don't thrive and i never have. and i want to give up on myself too.therapist gave up on me",1635363029,3358,647

They didn't respond. I felt so pissed that like a week later, I just emailed them to cancel the appointment. Then, they sent an email saying oh, you can talk to our director or whatever. I know they don't care. I've heard this woman's voice on call, and she sounds so apathetic. he never even bothered at least asking how I am feeling. he just went straight to asking generic questions like did you face abuse or do you have homicidal thoughts or do you have suicidal thoughts. I ended up lying about not having suicidal thoughts. It just felt like she didn't give a crap about me. It seemed like all she cared is whether I am a threat to others or I will ruin the reputation of the school. used to take antidepressants and then I ran out of medication. The stupid service is so complicated. I tried contacting them numerous times through email and their website. That psychiatrist just doesn't take her job seriously. All she has to do is literally prescribe medication and pay attention to emails from her clients. But she can't even do that. And she even overprices appointments like it's 500 dollars. I just hate this whole system.

I will never understand how anyone could ever think that just dumping on a person with depression and anxiety, pointing out everything that's wrong with them, everything they need to change, and comparing them to other people,  is or could ever be in any way helpful.  This is a favorite tactic of my father-in-law's, though.  He doesn't believe depression and anxiety are ""real"" diseases, he thinks they are weakness and laziness. been in a very bad place, dealing with an intense, long depressive episode for quite a long while now.  I'm unable to hold even a part-time job, I spend a lot of time in bed, and I have a tendency to become pretty withdrawn.  My father-in-law regularly tries to snap me out of it by coming to tell me what's wrong with me and how I should change it.  We did this about five minutes ago.  He came into the basement to do laundry, and started telling me all about how my husband's friend just got this great new job, and if he can do that, there's no reason you can't, that whole thing.  He went on to tell me that if I don't get a full-time job within the next couple of weeks, he's going to go broke (believe me, he's not).  Then he starts listing all the other shit I need to do, just this long, long list of chores and cleaning and errands and changes to make, including getting rid of our cats.  of all, I am fully aware that things need to change in my life.  I am overly aware of that, it is a thought that burdens me nearly 24 hours a day.  econdly, I do not appreciate being guilted to try to get me to do what you want.  That's not okay.  imilarly, I don't appreciate being lied to regarding the stress that I am putting on you.  Believe me, I already feel guilty, and I already feel bad about myself for living under your roof and not contributing, please don't try to make me feel even worse about it by telling me that it is going to impact you financially when I know that it's not.  Making me feel even worse about myself isn't helpful, and it isn't motivational.  And dumping a to-do list the size of a phone book on top of me only serves to make my anxiety flare and give me a panic attack.  Again, not helpful.  It also doesn't help that I am aware that you think of me as entited, manipulative and lazy, wanting to have everything handed to me without working for it.  If that were the case, I certainly wouldn't be living well below my means in your basement, pops!  I'd be married to some rich guy, lounging on the deck of a yacht.  I seriously can't understand how he can think I'm living this way by choice, just so I don't have to do anything because I'm just so damn lazy. really, really sucks when people don't realize that this isn't our fault.  We didn't choose it, we didn't cause it, and we are in pain, a ridiculous amount of it, all the friggin time.  That's what I got.  That's what I'm dealing with every damn day.

depression,"o while Im writing this im having a very hard time because well, Im not the person who is depressed (well not as much for now but could become later because of this issue) but the person im talking about is my mother. is nothing new, I have discovered something weird was going on because she has lost so much weight, got into new habits (bad habits like smoking) and has a lot of trouble sleeping and eating. he's even taking diazepam without prescription. This has been something occurring since at least a year or so ago when we found out she was physically attacking my father. Now this supposedly because she found out some evidence about him cheating, which all of it seems nonsense if you ask me, and well, my mother has always been the kind of person who doesn't trust anyone, she has even made up stuff about me and my sisters so its very hard to trust her arguments but I try to let her know that that has to be fixed on a different level separate from what is happening to her life and that if she needs time away from my father then be it. We support it. I cant say my father is a saint but what i know is that i want both my parents healthy and for a long time both and this is hurting them a lot. are three siblings in the family and each of us has had complicated relationships with her in the past but i can say that me and the youngest of my sisters are past that and we try to always stay in the family even with the hard times we had with my mother. I cannot say the same for my middle sister because she had the hardest time with my mom but she still keeps coming in on weekends. thing is that we all spoke to her a year ago about how they both needed counseling and my mother needing psychological treatment but I think we had a very bad approach since we knew about the attacks with my father and we use that against her so naturally she thought this was all a scheme from my dad and us, so that we make her get into treatment. he went into a couple of sessions with a therapist but didn't stay in and we thought the attacks were gone. were wrong, they were still happening, my mother recently bite my dad that we believe left so many blood stains on the bed (this according to a housekeeper we both have in common), and because of some conversations she had with my youngest sis (my mother tells my sis everything and what she thinks about my father but doesn't say anything about the attacks) we got really alarmed because of what she say: she started talking about sociopaths, murderers, and how they look like my father and how my mother would one day show up some evidence to ruin my dad for good. Of course there is no such thing, my mother has shown that evidence to other family members and they all tell me that the evidence is nonsense , its nothing but this is really into some other level of depression and anxiety that is making her think of those messages. my situation is that i dont want to wait until something bigger happens, you see they live in a different town and they come to my town every weekend and they have a 5 hour drive where i know some attacks had happened while my father was driving so this is very dangerous. My mother need psychiatric treatment asap and I love her so much that i dont want to wait until something worst happens to her because of that condition. I cant say I want them to fix their relationship but i know that for now she first needs to get better in order to make better decisions. o how do you think i should approach her to ask to get into treatment? hould my young sister be the one to try to convince her? We both? for your kind help and for your comments my sisters has tried in the past to tell her to go to therapy but also failed so that is why we dont know what to do now.How can I approach someone who desperately needs treatment but may think this is all a plan against her?",1635361546,3861,751

depression,"Let me start with my story because I really need to get it out of my chest and I have no friends.  came to the United tates when I was around 15 y/o, that was 6 years ago or so. I entered illegally to the UA just by... Crossing the border, walking. I'm a white Mexican, my family is from Ireland so they didn't even stare twice at me when I crossed or asked for any documentation. I took the risk to cross that way because I honestly didn't have anywhere else to go. My parents divorced when I was 8 and my mom moved with my sister to America, I was given the choice to stay with my dad and I took it, bad choice. My dad had always been dealing with drugs due to his untreated mental illness and he just one day abandoned me because he couldn't take it anymore, my aunt took care of me since then but she was very ashamed of what my dad had done and having me around meant her perfect lie of a life would be judged, so I technically lived in the backroom used for storage for years, studying from home so no one would know about me. My cousin always felt bad about this, he's my age and the only friend I've ever had, he's the only person I could talk to and one day he decided to help me out for a bit. He contacted my mom and my mom agreed to take me in, but since I had no way of getting documents or legal entrance due to my situation and little support, I had to do what I had to do. I was tired of living in a storage room, you know?  I arrived to the states, it didn't take much time to notice my life wasn't going to get that better. My mom had never cared much for my sister or me, she had married a man and they had their own kids, she separated her life from my sister and me and has always make us feel like we don't belong. I slept on a couch for weeks until she let me stay in a room they didn't use, she gave me an air mattress and a blanket, told me that if I wanted anything else, I had to work for it. And I did, until I fell ill in my senior year or so. Nothing new, I had always been a sick child, I'm weak and both my body and mind can't really stand much, but I was never treated because... Well, I'm undocumented and paying for treatment of any kind in my case is technically impossible, and of course my mom never cared about this.  situation got progressively worse, yes, both physically and mentally until reaching this point. I had developed OCD, depression and CPTD from a very young age and as time passed by it just got so much worse, these days I'm lucky if I pass a day without a panic or anxiety attack. My body hurts everyday due to my chronic illness and I can't work thanks to them, I can't eat most stuff and my younger sister seems to feel very worried about me all the time. he's working as a waitress by now to support our situation even if a bit, and this hurts my heart because we both really wanted to go to college, she's a very smart and sweet girl who deserves nothing but the best, unfortunately my mom won't allow my sister to use their IR info to get FAFA and I can't go to college because, well, I'm undocumented and you can't get your degree in my state until you're legal. I wanted to be an artist, you know? I got many art awards in H, I was offered many scholarships for the best art schools in the country. My sister cries whenever she sees anything art related, I know it pains her as well. We're barely getting by with the little money we manage to get and on top, my mom wants us out of her house by the end of the year because she wants to expand her room and we ""take too much space"", she even moved me to the garage and being there with my OCD is honestly just hell on earth. We just can't afford moving out, the rent is insanely expensive these days and we either eat, or pay for our rent. We barely have enough money to eat and yeah, moving out of the country would be hard because we don't have anyone anywhere. Both my parents were technically disowned by their families since they're the black sheep and no one wants to be associated with my sister and me. We've tried asking for help already but no one would dare to help us, our second plan was to get enough money to move to Mexico and live a nice life but again, we barely make enough. I honestly don't want to keep on living like this, I'm even posting this here because I don't have friends. I am very panicky of people all the time due to my upbringing and I can't allow myself to have friends or be close to anyone, my life sucks and I feel trapped. The only thing that keeps me alive right now is knowing my sister only has me in this life and she would be destroyed if I commit suicxde, but I'm technically useless and she'd miss me, yes, but at least she wouldn't have to worry about her sick and miserable sibling anymore. It would be just an unpleasant memory, perhaps.  if you've read this far: Thank you.

depression,"When I'm in class I easily raise my hand the most. In discussions I talk the most (I promise that it's from a position of actually wanting to engage, not just that I to hear myself talk). I can't help myself even when I'm tired in class, I'll still participate the same amount. o participation is never a problem. My engagement in the material is more than good enough for Your syllabus. But a combination of material conditions deteriorating fast and mental health problems make it an enormous effort just to get there have to manage paying for parking ($2/hr) while my grocery budget has shrunk by 2/3rds in the last year (now ~$20/wk after household). I have a long commute (1.5hrs). Between classes I just kill time in my car (4hrs) because it's not like I can afford to stay on campus the whole day. o then no, I can't do anything extracurricular or any fun events or shit because, again, no money. A sudden account charge, random fine, sudden expense - it sends my life into a spiral.  attending what amounts to just 7 classes a week is an enormous ordeal because it challenges every part of my mental health cocktail. I have to keep an absolute perfect budget because if one cent is mismatched then that's a class I can't attend or a meal I have to miss. Which makes fluctuating gas prices a joy to deal with. And budgeting is at odds with my incredible impulsiveness and coping mechanisms that all include spending of some sort that requires a ton of effort from a well of already overdrawn energy just to fight back against. And while I actually enjoy the morning commute it still ends up being 2hrs spent driving before I even get to class which, if you don't drive often, can be exhausting. Then, after one morning class, I have to spend 4 hours fighting through boredom or sleeping in my car. (Not to mention it is a million fucking times harder than you think it is to find a free, shady place to park. It's so obnoxious I get irate just talking about it). And I have to make sure I don't forget anything or I don't lose anything. I forgot my debit card one day, had to turn around, boom that's an extra 30 minutes to the commute. That was the extra 30 minutes I plan in each day for traffic.  all of this shit I have to push through is completely at odds with my ADHD/depression/anxiety etc. I'm constantly uptight about money and depressed because I can never meet any of my needs (or at least not comfortably). I'm in a knot while driving because even though I like to drive, one accident or one thing wrong with my car and my entire life is upended. Even though I only have 3 days of a school a week (I planned everything to fall on the same days) those 3 days are 12 hour long days. I wake up at 6:30 and get home at 6:30 which is hell on the chronic fatigue that comes with depression and the ADHD that has my circadian rhythm permanently offset which makes it so my body can never even start to sleep until after 12 or 12:30.  mental cocktail (including OCD and dysphoria) makes my thoughts and movements dissociated and messy but if I don't get these 36 hours exactly perfect as it is on paper then it all falls apart. Monday my ADHD meds fell in between my seats while I was rushing to class and the things are tiny so I had to just go without them and I was not of sound mind. guess I've entered the adult stage in life where everything needs to be executed perfectly and there's no excuses for failure and my entire physical and mental being is set up to fail everyday. I'm a nonstop series of tripping over myself. How the fuck am I supposed to be perfect?

depression,"I've battled depression my whole life. I've been through a ton of therapy, and frankly have become a much better and more resilient person for it. But none of that is helping pull me out of the two-year-long depressive episode. The reason is pretty simple.

I believed that I could never figure out the right job. I believed that I couldn't be happy without the right job or partner. I learned that we  current depression is different. It's not based in my beliefs about myself, but about despair around the rest of the world. I like myself! I like the person I am.

COVID.  know the world has never been a peaceful and stable place. And maybe I'm just entitled. Maybe I'm silly to want to be able to pick up a newspaper without crying, or say something on the internet without death threats, or have a kids without having to worry about whether there will even be a world for them to grow up in. what am I supposed to do? How the hell am I supposed to plan or make decisions when there's so much chaos and uncertainty? How the hell am I supposed to feel stable and safe when the world isn't stable and safe around me.

At first it was just missing lessons. It was easy to chalk up to just corona time being hard and needing to adjust to corona.  it's been a YEAR. I have been stuck. Whenever I have tried to do any school work, it's like a mist. Like it's just too hard to do, even though before I could. Then the doubts came in: others are smarter than me, all projects I do were not good enough... I'm sure everyone on this sub knows what I'm talking about. And seeing my classmates, even if just online? no can do. Maybe I just felt like a scam among them.  is both a relieve and another burden to bear. I'm relieved that I'm no longer ""wasting away"", just stuck without really doing anything.  I'm worried about future. Most worried I'm honestly about my parents. I still live with them and whenever I have tried to talk about having some problems... Well. Grit your teeth and find a way get trough it is the most usual response. once I could do it, but I really feel like depression has taken all charge left in my ""batteries"" to so speak.

To this point I've never considered myself depressed, nor took it into consideration, especially not selfharm or suicide, but for the last months my mood continued to roll downhill, so I thought I might take it into the list of possible reasons. make it as short as possible: The main symptom I recognize is especially the neglection of hobbies. I used to have no problem at all playing for example video games for multiple hours a day for a whole week, or used to have fun in my chess and boxing club. Now eerything seems boring to me. It's not like I want to stay in bed all day like a lot of people say, but when I think about something I could have fun with, my mind is empty. I evaluate and weigh all the different options, that used to be fun, like literally everything, YouTube, gaming, Netflix, reading, boxing, going for a walk, essentially living and decide what to do - going through each option and in the end picking none of it. Even when I was sad at times, I always could distract myself with YouTube or something, now even distracting myself from boredom sounds boring.  more or less function normally on a day to day basis and at times I might even laugh at a joke, but like 70% of my day I feel kinda empty.Completly agree with one symptom, completely disagree with another: Do I suffer from Depression?",1635352368,2374,406

I woke up this morning, and decided I wanted to try and fix?? things with people. I don't know. An example is, my long time friend with benefits cheated on his former girlfriend with me. I didn't know he wasn't single, but what isn't excusable is the fact that after that all went down, about a month later I started up the FWB relationship. I was/am so desperate to feel loved that I was okay with it. He would openly tell me he didn't want a relationship, but I still held so much hope, because I thought that maybe if I was seen as attractive by someone else, maybe it would rub off onto me.  and I became very very close, to the point of saying I love you to each other. But you guessed it, he still didn't want a relationship. I finally started to push him away a bit, even though I see him as one of my best friends. I just can't anymore. I hate myself, so goddamn much. And stopping this is the first step to giving myself some sort of self respect. followed the ex he cheated on with me. I dont know what she'll think. I messaged her over a year ago when it all went down, and I think we are on good terms, but she doesn't know that we were together throughout the year.

depression,"Throwaway for purposes of identity protection and anonymity. how can I begin this? the end of 2019, my dad died due to cancer and, although I've suffered for a while, I can't say the same for my little brother, who was 13 years old at the time. the year has ended, he entered into a very problematic depression with suicidal tendencies, in which he started taking Zoloft 50 at the time. forward to January 2020, my mom and I caught him trying to kill himself with a dozen or so of those damn pills and we didn't know how to react to that, and instead, we took him again to another psychiatrist. With that, this doctor also prescribed antipsychotic medications, along with Zoloft, because, at the time, he had this complaint that he was listening to words. forward again to May 2020, when he stopped taking those meds due to the doc's orders and, during those insane lockdowns, we've noticed that his symptoms haven't been improving and he tried to kill himself again and stopped going to his online therapy. fast forward to August 2021, because it's the time that he started having symptoms again and he was meeting more friends into his school, after a long year of lockdowns. We also noticed he was getting very stressed out for some reason and, due to that, we've seen him in several episodes, such as one where he pulled a kitchen knife and tried to kill himself in front of my mom. He was also caught trying to take again other medications to kill himself, and, the most recent event is where he was banging his head hard against the wall, and started to scream in pain. After all of that, we took him to a hospital and he started taking Zoloft again, but this time, it was a 100mg dosage to help him improve those symptoms. in October 2021, the school called and reported to us that he was having strong headaches, was very sleepy and moody and, the most problematic thing: he took 4 pills of Metamizole (dipyrone) 300mg and never even reported to us that he was having those headaches. for such a long report but, I don't know how I can help my brother overcome this issue and I can't get rid of the fact that I'm trying to do everything in my power to help him improve, but with his suicidal tendencies, he keeps telling me and my mother that he hates u and everybody else, that we're depriving his of his freedoms and that he wants to run away from home. to doctors orders, we have prohibited him from going outside to meet friends outside of school, go to social events unless supervised by another adult and, that he must be monitored all times, all due to his history of trying to kill himself multiple times, but, thank god he never even came closer to do that. I wanted to know how, along with the help of this amazing community, how can I help my brother overcome this suicidal tendency and depression?

depression,"I graduated university in June and moved to the west coast to help provide financial support for family and perhaps even pursue a post secondary degree as well. At first it was great, I connected with extended family more, adventured out into my new home, and felt like I just had a complete refresh take for my life. after a while, it got old. I started to miss people back home, very close friends specifically who I've known for the majority of my life. I'm struggling to figure out what I actually want to do with my life. I do not like the jobs I'm working at the moment to make ends meet. I don't have many friends here, my cousins are basically my only friends. forward to now, my close friends flew out to visit me for a week. I was super excited, especially them since it was their first time visiting where I live. But the rush quickly died down for some reason. Don't get me wrong, I am still laughing with them, sharing old stories and feeling back at home with their company. But then I get instant thoughts about after the week is done and they leave...it's back to the same old thing and feelings. Getting my work schedule for the week after probably didn't help.  I've been fixated on this the entire time. They seem to be enjoying every second of the visit but I am aware that I've been spacing out at moments (i.e when I'm driving, when they are laughing, when they are in a conversation). I get the feeling that they pick up on my sudden subtle moments of silence and awkwardness but I don't know.  know I should be enjoying the moment but I can't help it. I can't really feel the enjoyment, it feels like there's a one way mirror between me and my friends, even I know I'm not typically like this when we hung out before. Every time we went on hikes, I would deliberately step in puddles and mud getting my shoes, pants and socks wet, and stand in the heavy rain, just to get out of my head.I am supposed to feel the happiest I've ever felt in a few months but it's almost the complete opposite",1635343132,2014,381

At the beginning I could not move from bed, I could not eat, I could not work, I had multiple mental breakdowns every day and even self harmed for the first time in my life. I felt like I wasn't really here, I felt like I wasn't myself and even had suicidal thoughts.I wasn't even able to enjoy things I loved.

To even login to the game for half hour, say hello to friends, do few quests. illy, but for some reason it felt like a massive achievement.  also knew I needed help and I was not afraid to reach out.  was calling amaritans everyday, I made my way through GP and got antidepressants prescribed. After upping the dose for few months, today I have a feeling I might be on right dosage, but only time will show. I even invested some money to have few appointments with private therapist.  got closer with some online friends. Also, other friend group from a guild in a mmorpg we play turned out to be living not super far away so I got my first IRL friends that weren't work colleagues.  started being more open about my feelings. I was that kind of person who bottled up everything. Now I'm more honest. thing, once I moved out and started living by myself, I did another milestone: I started having walks. Mind you, I was a bit of a gym rat and always walked a lot before. It felt nice to move these rusty muscles and not felt super anxious and depressed.  I joined gym.  still felt down a lot and felt very depressed. Gym is not a magical cure but gives you some boost.

To start, I'm 22 and I've been diagnosed with depression and anxiety almost 8 months ago, despite struggling with it for years apparently, according to my psychiatrist. I've started taking sertraline and despite how hard things seemed to be (and here I'm gonna be clear: growing up in a house with an abusive mother who's still abusive, low self-esteem, not having a good job, doing whatever I could with university, quarantine, my friends and my girlfriend living in another city) after some months, I finally got a job. A job in another city, and I could see my friends and my girlfriend, and finally be happy. And I was. I surely was. Until yesterday. My full time job now will be a part-time job, and of course my salary will be reduced to the half. And I can't eat with that. Honestly, I feel useless. I know it's not my fault what happened. The company it's having a hard time and if it doesn't go well, everyone will lose their jobs. But I feel like a loser. I've never done anything with my life and I finally felt like I was someone. That I was doing something and I could be happy. That maybe this was the start of a life that I would like to live. And now I just wanna disappear forever, again, who would care anyway huh?

depression,"After 5 years of neglect, denial, shitty self-diagnosis, self-sabotage, waiting to magically get better, guilt, and feeling non-deserving of help, anger, and going in and out of loops, I finally went to a psychiatrist yesterday. It was just a small consultation, but I was so nervous that I cried thrice and thought of cancelling the plan yet another time. I was finally able to (after a lot of back and forth with myself) call a friend and ask her if she would come with me. he agreed, and helped me distract myself before the appointment. The appointment went well, I was able to hold back tears while telling my symptoms, and finally got properly diagnosed and got my illness explained to me. I have been prescribed medication which I'm still not sure I will take, but after the consultation I felt an immense sense of validation because for the first time I could tell myself that my illness is real. I don't know what will happen now, but at least for an evening, I was a little bit comfortable just being. This is a sign. If you are waiting around thinking that this is not real, and that you haven't tried hard enough to get better by yourself, or that you don't deserve help, you do.

depression,"I'm not going to badmouth meds, I understand that they do actually help some people. And it makes sense to try the pharmaceutical option when the cause of your feelings cannot be easily identified. But for me, I know why I feel depressed, and hopeless, and suicidal sometimes.  just lonely and have no reason to look forward to the future. be completely honest, I'm not totally alone. I have a mother, a little brother and a couple of old school friends I occasionally do things with. But I still feel like I don't really have any reason to keep going. My brother is getting married soon, and is planning on having children. Once that happens, I know I am practically never going to see him again. He's completely devoted to his partner (which I fully understand) and once they do have kids, they're not going to want to bother having to deal with me any more than they have to (I consider my brother to be my best friend, and I'm reasonably sure he does actually like me, but I'm also equally sure that his soon-to-be wife does not.) in my thirties now and have never had a partner. I have zero experience when it comes to romantic matters. Never kissed anyone, never even held hands with someone I cared about (in fact, I don't recall ever receiving even so much as a flirtatious smile from a woman before. Never mind anything else). I've pretty much given up on the idea of ever being in a relationship. It is just too late. No woman would accept a man my age having as little experience as I have. It is just too much of a red flag.  I really don't understand how I got to this state. I was shy and reserved in school, so I know that is the reason why I never had a girlfriend back then (and not many friends either). But I came out of my shell in college and at my first job. I became more comfortable and confident and I made a few more friends (who have all since moved on). But I never had any attention from women. I've always been self conscious about how I come across to other people, but I'm reasonably sure I am at least friendly (if not necessarily attractive). I just don't get it. What is it about me that is so repellent that has led me to become a 30+ year old man who doesn't even know what it feels like to hold hands with someone? And it is not like I don't have anything at all to offer. I own my own house. I have an okay job (not the best, but it's tolerable and it pays the bills). I must be likeable to some degree because I get on well enough with most people. It can't be the depression that turns people off, because I know I do a good job of hiding it (I even outright told my mother and brother I was severely depressed on more than one occasion, and every time they just shrugged it off and said something along the lines of ""You're just being stupid"". Which is always fun to hear).And I do have hobbies and passions which I spend a lot of time pursuing. I devote a lot of time to them because they keep my mind busy. I will admit that they are solitary pursuits, but that can't be helped (mostly due to where I live). I exercise regularly too, mainly because the endorphins help to trick my brain into thinking it is happy (albeit temporarily). none of that matters now. Whatever the reasons are, I've accepted the fact that I will never have a family of my own. But that begs the question? Why should I go on living? taying alive would not really be a benefit to anyone else. In fact, if I died, I know that my brother would actually be much better off financially as he would get my house. And that would help him and his family considerably. If I stayed alive, all they would have is the miserable uncle who lives alone, and who they see every couple of months or on special occasions, and then only out of obligation rather than actual affection.  feel as if I am in a dilemma: I just go the doctor? And let them medicate me in the hope that it will mask the unsolvable issues which are causing me to feel so hopeless.  I carry on as I am?

depression,"Hi, there! o I (F22) dated a guy (M21) for nearly 3 months. It was a serious relationship, his parents knew I existed, and his mother even listened to my podcast. I was happy and in love, he treated me with respect, and did things I didn‚Äôt even ask for. Like, I‚Äôm a virgin, and he took it so serious - even more than me, because I was ready to have sex, while he wanted to wait and make sure I‚Äôm 100% ready. Of course we did all the intimate things, but there were no penetration, like a ""real sex"" He was my first boyfriend, my first kiss, etc. But it ended really-really bad.  day, when we were arguing (which, to be honest, we did regularly during the relationship but it didn‚Äôt lasted more than a day, and if it was my fault I had always being apologising  and bought him nice little presents. Honestly, those fights were always over something small). o, one day during the little fight he texted that we need to stop dating because of his unstable state. I won‚Äôt give many details, but it turned out that near two years he had this depressing mood swings, when he doesn‚Äôt wanna see anybody and then he even asked hid sister to spend nights at his place, so he won‚Äôt harm himself.  I was shocked and angry that he didn‚Äôt told me that before, I was so much in pain. Like one week he told me he loves me, want me be near his side, and next ‚Äì ""we aren‚Äôt close enough, I want to break up""  so one month left, I was trying to support him by texting sweet stuff as one guy with depression from YouTube recommended. And important thing - I made a big research on depression, and what should I do, I accepted the end of our relationship, and tried to understanding, knowing that he needs not a partner but a caregiver.  But what was the end-result: After 2 weeks he was feeling better, but he didn‚Äôt even acknowledge how his lying and harsh break-up harmed me.  We had a big fight over this.  He said he doesn‚Äôt want to reconcidle, because we were constantly arguing. I thought it was so unfair, because every fight we had before this depression talk, we resolved and from my part I tried to repair the damage I‚Äôve done.  Then he started behaving really disgusting:  he canceled our meeting, he made me responsible for why our relationship ended both in calm way and angry way (""I was right that I dumped you""), and he texted that he is feeling bad meanwhile posting happy pictures with texts on Instagram from his vacation.  And this person said he doesn‚Äôt like taking photos.  tried to be understanding, but the last thing was his explanation over our ""second breakup"":  didn‚Äôt stop loving you. We just aren‚Äôt compatible. I want to have a relationship with someone who is a good person. But I like you as a person, let‚Äôs be friends?"" WTF? I send him a long-long message explaining how I was feeling, and how he didn‚Äôt value neither me, nor our relationships. That he is selfish, irresponsible, and immature, and that I don‚Äôt want to be neither friends, nor lovers. I don‚Äôt even want to see him. And blocked on every social media.  my question is:  it normal for a depressed person behave like that? He isn‚Äôt clinical depressed.

For the past two years my weight has been stuck in 39 kilograms no matter how much I eat. Which makes me even further depressed. No matter how depressed I'm I always try to eat three meals a day but I cannot see the end of this. parents and family don't think of it as an issue. They say I have always been like that. They cannot even tell I'm depressed severely because of all this. had very bad hairfall during this time period and went to doctor and got lots of supplements (including iron- turns out I have anemia) but now it has settled down. And I have low to no hairfall. context on this hairfall started when I went vegan for like two months. After two I realised it is not healthy for me. (I'm originally a vegetarian) teeth is another issue. I lost one front teeth due an accident and had to get veneers. I had stains on the teeth near the replaced teeth which went away after a dental cleaning. But I have a weakened enamel on one teeth. I am afraid I might get cavities more easily because of my weight. in may family we eat lots of carbs like white rice and whole wheat bread. Knowing that starch in carbs is not healthy for teeth makes me hate myself for not knowing it before. have super bad health anxiety.

depression," My name is Jordan im a 30 year old male and I have been suffering with depression for around 2 years &amp; anxiety for around 8 years. Up until January last year it was manageable, now it has spiralled out of control. I was optimistic about life and was in the process of building a future for myself after failing at many things in the past. I started college when I was 25 studying music technology, I then progressed onto a uni course studying a BA in Music Production. In my studying years I was happy, enthusiastic and excited. I met some great new friends, I had a girlfriend, I went on lots of holidays, attended events, parties, had a job on the side &amp; a plan. Life was good until I graduated, and coronavirus hit. My business plan that I was planning on launching when I graduated was no longer viable due to the current circumstances. At this point I currently don‚Äôt have a girlfriend no more, I'm living with parents, minimal friends, no job, no money, drinking heavily and have zero motivation or interest in anything. Constant fatigue, I find it hard getting out of bed and doing the same shit day in day out. My anxiety has got to the point where I can‚Äôt go in busy shops or even go get a haircut. I feel lost, a failure, embarrassed, anxious, trapped, lonely and scared. I am waiting to see a therapist for the anxiety/depression but have been waiting nearly 3 months and have not seen anyone yet.

My father died from cancer within 2 months and I broke down and ended my 5 year relationship with my girlfriend. I thought now would be the perfect time to end it all. Then something happened I felt like a part of my mind just opened for the first time I saw how miserable I was making myself and how I was pushing everyone away, for the first time I felt motivated to change. motivation left as quickly as it came but it set me on a path.

depression,"I have been dealing with some depressive disorder for at least 15 years, its similar to bipolar, but its not, I'm not dangerous in any 'manic' episodes, but I do have what I perceive as manic episodes. have developed methods dealing with it, I am physically fit and intelligent, I have plenty of skills and I have worked on my self esteem and fully understand I am useful to many people.  just don't want anything for myself, I mostly dislike being around anyone too long, most people irritate me, or I just don't want to be around them when I know I'm likely to irritate them, because I do have negative personality traits, not entirely, I'm a decent person all around, but ill often accidently cause problems and I just cant be bothered with those, and who wants to be around a miserable person? I have pretty effectively isolated myself over time, and to be honest, I am almost entirely alone, this is partly intentional but also a result of a troubled background and childhood leaving me with almost no support structure. Dealing with this alone is definitely not the way to do it, but I seemingly don't have a choice, I did have a relationship last year, but that ended when it became clear she just enjoyed the fact that I put her before myself consistently and she was more or less unprepared to help me with anything. he knows how bad I get but has essentially abandoned me after saying 'I am not abandoning you', yeah that stings a bit, but she's 22 and has her own issues so whatever (I'm 31, I didn't expect to get into a relationship with that age difference, but it just happened).  am uninterested in working, because why? I don't want anything. I am unemployed currently but to be honest I could walk in to a remote work job if I had the will to try ( I am pretty decent with code ). I have work I enjoy over winter coming up in just over a month and I will be happy to do that, but then I need to last another 9 months or so before anything else turns up that effectively distracts me.  go up and down, but the lack of interest in anything is more or less permanent. I just try and distract myself from it, but recently I am in a down swing and have stopped eating properly and accomplish almost nothing in a day except sometimes exercising and listening to inside on repeat cause it makes me feel less alone. feel kind of rare, I see all this depression from others that is about something, like about self esteem, or trauma or some status or event, but really I should be fine, I am skilled, intelligent, physically fit, reasonably attractive, have access to employment that would pay more than average, but still I just want to curl up and die because there is nothing worth doing anymore. I barely feel anything except a dull pain, I upset a friend of mine because I told her I couldn't feel excited about things like she does. feel like i am a hyper empath, self diagnosed so whatever, but experiencing things like guilt, shame, or sympathetic / second hand feelings are intense. I am pretty sure more intense than most. This is, i think, the underpinning of why i keep away from people, to try and avoid feeling these things because they dominate me and are unpleasant. This makes me behave a bit like an autistic person, but I think its almost the opposite. ( this doesn't mean i understand emotions better, just means i feel them intensely ). I know i said i barely feel anything, but i think this is because i have learned over my life that feelings are dangerous, and i have just become very good at reasoning them away, and avoiding any reason to feel anything. o now i feel dull nothing and pain most of the time. I don't know, maybe it doesn't make sense but this is how it feels. time I wake up I'm disappointed that I did, and I spend almost every moment wishing id already ended.

depression,"First time posting on this sub, so thanks for anyone who replies or comments :). like to start this post by saying i am a young person in my teens who has been experiencing many symptoms of depression on and off for extended periods of time for the past few years now, and have started seeing my therapist again, im in a really rough patch at the moment and the time has come where medication is now an option, with prozac/fluoxetine being recommended. Please keep in mind i am not diagnosed, nor will i say i do have clinical depression but over the past few months ive started to feel like i actually do. As stated earlier, these long extended periods of depression have been happening for the past few years after moving countries and experiencing a lot of change (this is what kickstarted it), and as i have down my own research i think my reoccurring symptoms indicate i may have it along with the fact that medication now being an option. But this makes me feel dirty for some reason, i think it's wrong of me to take medication when i am not even diagnosed, for some reason it puts me off. into how i feel will be quite extensive, i really apologize for such a long post, i just want to get all this off my chest into a community that is really supportive and understanding. Ive been in a pretty bad depressive period for a few months now, with my anxiety now coming back quite badly, and ive had a lot of really negative feelings. Ive developed a distinct self hatred of myself, i really hate who i am, and how weak/powerless i feel, my family has done so much to support me and help me get up and have given me opportunities yet i am staying at home feeling like i both cant be bothered and too anxious. Tying into this, the idea of happiness feels so foreign to me now, i haven't had genuine happiness in years, and whenever i do feel happy, it feels so fake and uncomfortable. It's almost like i am invalidating my true feelings, i'm not that happy at all outside of hanging out with friends, but whenever i crack jokes and laugh with them it makes me feel dirty. Why waste energy being happy now when in a few minutes when i get to be alone and have time to think, ill retreat back to my self hatred, hopelessness and negativity? It is an endless cycle that is so utterly frustrating, i hate it, the one thing i hate (being depressed) is the one mental state i actually feel comfortable in, it's infuriating. All these small moments of ""happiness"" make me feel so fake, as if im living a double life. On one end when with friends i am ""happy"", funny, and outgoing but on the other hand, i am depressed, hopeless, negative, and full of self hatred. It's sickening. These two lives of mine really make me question who i am and who i want to be? Who am i really? Everything is so confusing.  top of this I feel so hopeless, i really have no faith the future will be okay, will i ever get out of this endless cycle of being temporarily better and then feeling like shit for months? Will i end up being successful? Will i find someone i love, and who loves me back? Will i get a job i like? I can't help but only see negative answers to these questions. This hopelessness sometimes makes me question whether everything is worth it or not, i am so tired of it all, i cannot be bothered to keep going back to square one and making the same progress only to be struck down again. It is the same every fucking day. I would never, ever kill myself, but i want to be freed, i want to disappear, and i want to be at peace where i don't need to worry about everything. ometimes i feel so worthless.  am getting 8-9 hours of sleep every night so why am i feeling tired? Why can't i concentrate on my tasks for more than 30 minutes? God, im just so sick of it all tbh. uch a pain in the ass.  concept of medication really scares me, the possible side affects really put me off, but ive tried a lot now to progress and improve myself mentally where im thinking that this could be worth a try.  you have read even half of this i appreciate it. Thanks for reading.i'm so confused and down",1635325651,4082,778

I have no strong desires or goals so I'm just floating around aimlessly with no idea what I want to do in life. I'm sexually inactive because I don't think anyone would want a loser like me. I can't even get it up. Either that or I finish early. Thus I distance myself from women. I'm also broke af and extremely exhausted. I've been wanting to kill myself because I don't see the point in living and I try to find it but the journey has been too long and painful. constantly receive compliments from people for my looks and talents but usually those are people I'm not close to or strangers who don't know the real me. I just fake my confidence on social media. In real life I'm this moody anxious dude who's always on fight or flight mode. Being around me must be exhausting and I can't help but feel people are better off without me. If only I can kill myself without hurting my family. I can only hope to die in my sleep or that a vehicle crashes into me or that I contact some terminal illness. ometimes I have terrible thoughts of hoping to lose a loved one so that I'd have a reason to completely give up.

depression,"Hi everyone, this is my first post here, hoping to find some solidarity that others may feel the same way as i do as right now i feel so alone.  last 7 years of my life have been complete misery and every day i struggle to find a reason to keep going. A little bit about myself: I was diagnosed with generalised anxiety 7 years ago when I was 13, i believe my anxiety was a product of my school environment where myself and my friends were picked on and made fun of every single day for 5 years for just being ourselves? People i didnt know and who didnt know me were just nasty and singled me out for no reason and i still to this day struggle to understand why and it still, 4 years after leaving school has a really negative impact on my life.  don't know who I am, i feel like i have no personality, my mind feels blank and empty all the time like a constant fog, i struggle to connect with people for this reason, i feel like a bore people, that  i have nothing to add to conversation, that people have no interest in me and have better things to be doing than be around me. I see people around me all the time chatting and laughing and connecting with each other and i just do not seem capable of doing that , im not funny or witty or clever so any conversation i do have seems to lack depth and meaning.  crave deep meaningful relationships, I desperately want to be able to connect with someone and feel safe around someone who i can trust and who i feel will not judge me for being me... whoever that is.I just wish i could talk and connect with people like a normal person without constantly feeling like im boring them, or making myself seem weird and pushing them away.  also really struggle to become interested in hobbies and new topics. Not a lot interests me and anything I do find interesting i seem to lose interest in very quickly, become bored of it and then im back to square one. I find myself to be a very 'all or nothing type person',  at one point im super in to something and then the next im totally disinterested and have no motivation to do it again-a  good example of this is the gym. Because of this, again i feel like im a boring person because i have no hobbies and therefore nothing to talk about much with people.   has been a part of my life for the past 5 years. I haven't been clinically diagnosed because i keep putting off going to the doctors and getting help. I just feel like they won't actually care and just think of me as 'just another depressed person' . I also suck at talking to people face to face and telling them how i feel. Online is much easier to talk because it feels like no one is watching you. Whenever i try and talk to people i just feel like im being a burden and i feel selfish and guilty for dumping all my problems and feelings on to them. I don't like people worrying about me, it makes me feel silly and like an inconvenience . often find that when i'm going in to another depressive slump i become really agitated, impatient and sometimes rude and the people around me and it makes me feel like a horrible person. ome people notice when im not in a good place and want to look after me but i don't want them to, i just want to be left alone and it annoys me when people try and care for me and i end up just being unpleasant and i hate it. I've always stood by that mental health is not an excuse to be a twat.  often feel i don't have a valid reason to be depressed , i had an ok childhood minus a few family problems ( parents separating when I was young, brother had substance problems, he also suffers from depression), school life was shit but now i have a full time job, i earn money, i can support myself but im still so miserable. It doesn't matter what good things come my way im still miserable.  have had suicidal thoughts many times, a lot of days i sit and think i would rather be dead but i coudl never do it because i know i have a family who cares and it would destroy them if i ever did, so i wont. going to end this rant here, look forward to hearing from you all.Feeling lost and hopeless",1635319548,4075,796

They ignored me. My mother, kind of cared, but then she died. My dad then lost his mind and resorted to drinking, he'd usually be fun and stuff, but eventually, he changed. He started beating me. With no mercy whatsoever. I even visited him when I went into college, (17 because I was homeschooled) he smashed a beer bottle into the side of my face, there were shards inside, it was excruciating, but due to the years of beating, I was desensitized.

Having high grades for them was the bare minimum. Now I'm not a prodigy anymore. Is it because I'm suddenly not good anymore? No, it's because since I started highschool I began losing interest in everything. I left the volleyball team, I abandoned my dream of becoming a singer (which I had for 10 years or so) and I started studying less and less.I think I've always been depressed (I remember trying to kill myself when I was 6 because I thought my parents didn't love me), but these years it started seriously interfering with my life.Last year I was bulimic and I almost became anorexic. I've gained weight since then, but now I feel fat and uglier than before. I also fainted in the school toilet. The sad part is that last year was going really well in the beginning. I was at a healthy weight and I felt pretty, I also started studying more and my grades went up. Then covid hit again and we had to have our lessons from home. This completely fucked me up. I started losing a kilo or more per month and my grades went down. I also skipped school many times, to the point my homeroom teacher had to talk to my mother about this.This is my third year (I go to a Classico, which is a type of Italian highschool) and it really started badly. My grades are shit and I already have 14 absences.I'm terrified of having to repeat the year, but I also suffer from sever anxiety and panic attacks.I feel like shit. I really want to stand up and get back to being who I really am, but I feel so powerless and overwhelmed. I really just want to be free.

depression,Recently I went through a bad bout of depersonalization which led to a deep depression. My anxiety spiked and I started getting intrusive thoughts which scared me so bad and made me feel like I was going insane so I called 911. They put me on celexa and two weeks in I couldn‚Äôt sleep. I went 80 hours without sleep and felt like my body was shutting down. Then after another trip to the ER I was put on klonopin and taken off of the celexa. Things were fine for a couple weeks. Then the depression came back hard and I started feeling very suicidal. I was crying all the time and I didn‚Äôt know why. When it got to the point where I couldn‚Äôt sleep again and felt like I might do something I went back to the ER and spent the night in the suicide intervention unit. They changed my meds up again. I finally felt like things might start looking up and something in my brain told me ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt going to last.‚Äù That night I became hyper aware of my breathing. This has been going on a month. It‚Äôs all I think about through most of the day and a lot of times I feel like I can‚Äôt breath right or am out of breath. I also started vaping due to stress which doesn‚Äôt help.

depression,"This will be very long, just warning you. I was the happiest 7th grader you could've met, I was nearly always happy and bubbly and just an all around fun person to be around. Covid hits, we were told we would be back in a couple weeks. Doesn't happen, we never went back that school year and then I moved in the summer, so basically because my parents didn't let me have a phone I lost contact with all my friends. I got really depressed, I need people to function and my family was driving me insane. I cut myself that fall, it was October 15th. I barely survived that. I was bleeding for an hour and i didn't care, so i was just bleeding out while my parents were away at work. An a hour and a half goes by, I'm light headed. I think to myself ""why am I doing this?"" And just kinda drag myself and I grab a towel, press on my wrist for a good half hour, and just had like 15 bandaids om it until 5pm, about 30 minutes until my mom would be home. I just only wore long sleeves for all winter to cover up the scars, my parents still don't know. I threw the towel in a trash bag and took it out later with the normal trash. I go to in person school for about 2 weeks after that and unexpectedly go virtual for another 3 months. That nearly pushed me towards a second attempt.  Capital riots in Washington D.C. grandparents best friend and her husband died, someone fell asleep behind the wheel and drove straight through their bedroom at 1 am. I go back to in person school for a bit, start making a couple friends. Of course we move again in the summer and i still don't have a phone to contact people the summer: my parents separate for a month (they are together and doing better then ever rn)  I get a phone, contact a couple people. My best friend (who happens to be a girl who I have a huge crush on) gets a boyfriend. Wasps terrorize me all summer, I had at least 5 stings by August. chool starts, Its alright enough. Pretty much right away fights start happening every day in school. I feel kinda down on my luck, everything sucks.  fast forward a week before homecoming. A girl who i had a small crush on but knew it wasn't happening (or so i thought) asks me to homecoming. I say yes, (obviously, I'm not an idiot) and then later asks if we're dating, i say suree, so I'm assuming you like me and she said yes and so we started dating ig. We go really well for the first week, homecoming happens and i follow her around and try to chill but i don't know anyone. Next two weeks ars just kinda more meh and she breaks up with me on the Monday of what would've been our 4th week. It didn't tear me up too much, just for about 2 days and it hurta every so often but it didn't hurt as bad as a 3 year relationship would've.  on Thursday my great aunt died on sunday we had to give one of our cats back to the shelter yesterday i found out my best friends mom could die i got grounded I don't have my phone playing music to keep my suicidal thoughts at bay, and its getting harder to even care.I (14m) want to give up",1635310960,3020,596

depression,"Just want to vent right now, thank you for listening if you‚Äôre reading this.  the past year I‚Äôve been living on my own. I lived in an isolated bubble on my own , simply went to work and home and just kept rrpeating this cyc. I shut out my friends for so long that I lost them. I stopped going on any social media because it just made me feel like a piece of crap. My college classes were online so it there was little room to interact with people. year however I decided to move in to a better place which has a better commute to work and cheaper rent with an old friend from high school. I thought that living with another person would help me get out of my isolated and depressive state of mind that I‚Äôve been inside of for so long. But I keep comparing myself to my friend. In some ways it has helped me become a bit more active seeing another person active around me. But most days I just come home to an empty apartment because she‚Äôs out partying, out on a date, or just has some other plans. I feel resentment that since I‚Äôm working full time and going to school I can‚Äôt enjoy any of those things. I never have time to hang out with the few friends I do have because of the little time I have between classes and a full time job. I resent the fact that I‚Äôve never been in a relationship, or that I am unlikeable in comparison to her. I resent the fact that she has loving parents who support her emotionally and financially. I just feel like a waste of life piece of shit . This resentment just turns into loneliness at some point because I know she won‚Äôt understand my situation and that she is ultimately a very nice and supportive friend.

depression,"I was going through one of the most difficult times of my life because of school and family which made my depression and suicidal ideation worse. I have a significant other (O) who is amazing but the timing was just terrible. During that same time, O was grieving the loss of a family member. I tried to be there for them in any way I can but when that person slowly began to distance themselves to attend the family events and increasingly barely talked to me for a few months, I reached my breaking point.  was just even more depressed because I felt truly alone. And maybe because I wasn‚Äôt in the right state of mind, I was also jealous of another person my O was constantly with because they were both grieving for the loss. When we talked about it, my O insisted they only saw that person as ‚Äúfamily‚Äù but it really sucks when your O is around that person 24/7 and I only talk to them once every 2 weeks. When I found out last minute they planned a trip together out of state, I was heart broken. O doesn‚Äôt understand why I‚Äôm so sad. Everything O says contradicts their behaviors.

Without you guys I would have died long ago. Once again thank you. Below is my suicide note. world is an unfair and unjust place. Take my father for example, everyone thinks he is the best person in the world. Well he might be the best worker but that's where his accomplishments end. He is not a good father or a good husband or even a good human being. If fact he is the most inhumane human being I have met in my entire life. He knows I am suicidal but he has not even once tried to console me, tried to stop me. In fact he has on multiple occasions told me to go kill myself. When he is in home he rules with an iron fist because when he is outside of home he is everyone's bitch. Home is the only place he can live out his power fantasy. If you are reading this then I am already dead all because of the Depression, anxiety and god knows what else mental illness he gave me when I was growing up. If you refresh your memory then you will remember that my father used to tie me up and beat me till I passout for anything and everything. ometimes for no reason, just because he felt like it. You have no idea what went behind closed doors in my house when I was young. And after doing all that he refuses to admit that he did anything wrong, he even refuses to admit that Depression is a real mental illness. He genuinely believes that i want to kill myself because I am too lazy, because that makes a lot of sense.

depression,"back again on my other account was fucking awful and i have to vent about this somewhere context im some 14 year old who for the past 4 months ive been just really depressed. i take antidepressants and see a therapist but nothings really been helping, and i havent been able to help myself. ive felt like ive lost interest in everything and dont really talk to that many people. usually spend a little bit if extra time in the bathroom cause i just need a bit if a break during class sometimes. yesterday i saw this writing on one of the bathroom stalls saying someone was gonna shoot up the school on Wednesday. i took a picture of it and gave it to my teacher and he sent it to some other people. i got called down later that day to add a few things to it and was just told to delete the picture.  people just kept on asking shit about it to me, and in the middle of my 6th period i get called out of class to get questioned by our sherif &amp; assistant principal. i had to fill out this statement thing. after like five minutes she started accusing me of doing it because the things i said in the statement apparently didnt add up, even though i ADDED EVERYTHING i could, because i was the first one who saw it and was in the bathroom for a while. i had to explain to them how thats just not the type of thing i would do and how my life has been kindof horrible the past few months. i had a breakdown cause i couldnt handle being accused of this stupid shit i didnt do. after like 10 minutes they bring in the school psychologist. now the only thing ive heard about online is how much school councilors/psychologists suck, so it was kind of hard for me to just talk to them a little. but after like 2 minutes they tell me i have to go into the principals office.  had to talk with him for like 10 minutes about how my life has just been kind of miserable lately and i had another breakdown. after that i talked to the psychologist a little bit more then was shoved into this empty meeting room. the worst part was that there was basically nothing in the meeting room, and they took my phone. so i was just alone with my thoughts for two fucking hours. i had this audio video club i had been wanting to go to since i missed the last week  Nd have had no plans/interests in months but since i was stuck in that fucking room for two hours i had to miss it.  my mom shows up and they talk about things for like five minutes then we leave. my mom in the car keeps talking to me about how the principal wanted my mom to look through my phone and i had another breakdown because she just kept on saying the stupidest shit and not listening to me. i get home and my dad comes in my room for like an hour so he can talk to me more about the issue even after im so emotionally exhausted. keeps telling me that he sort of thinks its me even though i told him a hundred times it wasnt me and he just wouldnt believe me. he told me to get out some of my papers with my handwriting on it to compare it to the writing on the stall and he said they look similar even though it looked way messier. i dont even have any type of black marker to write with anyway.  also found out the guy who brought my shit up to the office forgot my fucking computer charger so now i cant use the main thing i central my freetime around and spend more of my time being depressed. we go out to dinner and they wont stop fucking talking about it. when i get home im just exhausted and do my usual 2 hours of sitting on my phone sad in bed without getting up. just really tired from all of this and i want it to end. this feels like its only making my depression worse than it already was. just so fucking annoying. note im non binary (he/she/they) and i have been for like four months but its been really hard to just tell that to my parents with all this shit going on to anyone who reads this fucking help me‚Äî some alone depressed 14 year old on the internet on their bedi am having the worst day of my life",1635305896,3977,789
depression,"Hello Everyone,  just wanted to start off by saying I was diagnosed with clinical depression when I was 13, and was treated with a combination of therapy &amp; anti-depressants for a while which ended up being highly effective. However, this was quite some time ago.  18 now, started university a couple months ago, and have been exhibiting some concerning symptoms.  I‚Äôm constantly stressed, tired, anxious, and I feel as if my memory &amp; concentration have gone severely downhill.  symptoms have persisted over the last couple of months, and i feel like it‚Äôs destroying the person I was.  I used to be insightful, creative, funny, motivated, and an excellent student, but lately Ive been feeling like I‚Äôve lost these qualities. I feel like I‚Äôve lost my intelligence, like my friends don‚Äôt find me funny anymore or enjoy my company, and that due to the constant brain fog, stress, and fatigue, the person I used to be has been lost forever. I also find that there is nothing that gives me any real relief or joy anymore.  addition to this I also suspect I‚Äôve developed illness anxiety, which has only served to make matters worse as I‚Äôm constantly on edge due to this ‚Äúlife-threatening illness‚Äù I believe I must have.  few weeks ago I found what I thought to be a strange lump in my chest (I‚Äôm a male btw) that I believed to be breast cancer. I agonized over this constantly until I visited my doctor who informed me it was simply normal breast tissue.  that I was convinced that the intense fatigue I was experiencing throughout the day was due to some sort of life threatening deficiency in my blood, only to have all my blood work done and come back completely fine.  current worries have shifted to the nearly constant feeling that I have a brain tumour, and that must be what‚Äôs causing my brain fog, lack of motivation, and inability to concentrate. I‚Äôm aware that this is highly unlikely but I can‚Äôt help but think about it almost constantly.  feel like these may be symptoms of depression but I‚Äôm hesitant to say so because my depression felt ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù last time.  I was struggling with depression as a child I felt a constant, overwhelming sadness. Obviously this was hard, but at least I could somewhat understand what it was that was causing me to feel the way I was.  days I don‚Äôt necessarily feel ‚Äúhappy‚Äù or satisfied by any means but not an overwhelming sadness either, more just hollow, exhausted, and confused. I don‚Äôt really have any one I can talk to about this because I can hardly make sense of it all myself, but here‚Äôs to hoping someone out there can resonate. If you made it to the end of this post, I also sincerely appreciate it, and I apologize for my rambling! forgot to mention issues with my eating. My appetite is absolutely non-existent. As a result, I‚Äôve lost approximately 30 lbs without trying as I was eating little to no food simply because I never had the urge too or didn‚Äôt have the energy to prepare something for myself. I‚Äôve had family comment on how skinny I‚Äôve been getting so I‚Äôve been trying to eat proper meals at regular intervals over the past week and a half.

depression,"I've noticed an awful lot of misinformation on this subreddit on antidepressants, including ""antidepressants can be addictive"" and ""antidepressants won't give you withdrawals when you stop taking them."" of these things are absolutely incorrect. omeone who takes Zoloft (or any other non-addictive medication) every day, is dependent. This means that their body is used to getting this medication daily. When you lower your dose, or stop taking it all together, you will likely experience minor withdrawals (a lot of people do, but they're generally pretty minor). Withdrawals do not indicate that you are addicted to a medication.  can be dependent without being addicted, and a lot of people are. Granny taking Lortab for her cancer pain is probably dependent, but probably not addicted. Billy, who takes Keppra for his epilepsy, is dependent, but is certainly not addicted. Addiction is marked by the continuous use of a substance (or anything, really, like gambling), in spite of the negative effects it has on your work, family, social life, health, etc, and that you will put this substance first before other needs (like not paying your bills so you can buy more meth, for example). Another part of it is that it is difficult to control your use, like you take Oxycodone more often than prescribed, you tend to run out sooner than normal, your use is continously ramping up, etc. A person isn't going to have work or social issues because they take Prozac, and they're certainly not going to pawn their guitar, consider robbing a pharmacy, steal from someone's medication cabinet, or spend all of their rent money to get more Prozac if they run out. Antidepressants **aren't** addictive. You will likely become dependent on the medication if you take it for a longer period of time (a month or more), which simply means your body is used to it and you will likely experience minor withdrawal symptoms when you lower your dose or quit taking it all together.FYI on antidepressants",1635303960,1985,330

depression,"Background: I never moved out of parent's house due to my depression and anxiety. I wanted to save money and go to college locally so that's what I did. I graduated with a Marketing degree last December. I've smoked weed since I was about 14. I've smoked daily for at least about 5 years, maybe less, maybe more. I never viewed it as a problem growing up. I used it to relax, enjoy things, appreciate life. months after graduating I took a sales job that wasn't for me. I quit about a month ago and struggle to find the motivation to apply for jobs/be productive every day. I don't know what kind of job I want, I don't know what I want to do with my life, and it's slowly killing me. I love my parents, I don't have any problems living with them. Is that pathetic? Maybe. I don't know. it hit me. I've been smoking weed and doing nothing but getting a degree and that's it. I'm 24, 25 in May I feel like I've accomplished nothing and that I've wasted so much time smoking instead of moving out and getting a real job and doing what people do. I don't want to quit, I love weed. But I'm questioning if that is the reasion why I'm in the position i'm in. I had a full time job that I quit because of my social anxiety of outside sales.

depression,"This isn‚Äôt a rant or something too bad, it‚Äôs actually somewhat okay and as someone who was diagnosed with clinical depression at the age of 5, i finally feel okay enough to talk about this (w/20)  live with my girlfriend (wlw 1.5yr), but we live with my mother and my sister and my dad (who‚Äôs moving out soon). My girlfriend and I have struggled with jobs and we just recently got one together at Kroger. Long story short- we worked 2 days and requested to be transferred (if u want the whole story of that lmk i‚Äôll post it. it‚Äôs MEY) Anyway, like i said i was diagnosed w/ depression at 5. severe depression at 13 as well as anxiety. Later diagnosed with borderline personality disorder  and adhd at 17. I have severe IB which will put me in the bathroom for HOUR on end (more like days), i also struggle with weight heavily (all my life) and eating, as i‚Äôve gon through every eating disorder at least twice. but anyway!  struggle greatly with living life in general, i‚Äôm unorganized and all over the place.  i tell you this girl stormed into my life and changed it for the better?? i LITERALLY mean my life has been the best it‚Äôs been despite not being able to buy groceries, despite having to drive a janky scary car, despite constantly having fights with my mom over money, and despite all my mental health and physical problems. This girl is teaching me LOVE and not just love in a relationship but loving myself and respecting myself and being patient with myself. she‚Äôs showing me i am deserving and i am lovable and i should love my own damn self as well. was on medication from age 13 on and off (bc im very bad at taking meds) to age 18. i have a psychiatrist and two psychologists who treat me with so much kindness and respect. My first ever therapist told me to ‚Äúcome back when you want to actually talk to me‚Äù‚Ä¶ i was in middle school‚Ä¶ struggling with talking in general. The day she told me that was the day i stopped going to see her. then i found sarah, michael and ililliana. they‚Äôre truly wonders and when i told my psychiatrist (ililliana) i was off my meds for a while she said i seemed to be doing great and my life was doing well and i didnt feel like i needed the meds anymore. which is what we were wanting in the long run! I only see her once a year now and i occasionally go see sarah when i have the money (i havent for a while so it‚Äôs been about 2 years). life right now is not perfect, nor is it really good at all. i‚Äôm struggling so much financially, i‚Äôm anorexic without a thought because i just cant afford groceries. my girlfriend is also similar but i try to feed her what i can find if she‚Äôs up for it.  someone who tried to kill herself 13 times, (7 times institutionalized) I no longer have this thought of suicide. i have something to live for, and it‚Äôs not just my girlfriend, it‚Äôs myself, my mom, my siblings, my animals(my babies). I finally know how to love myself and i‚Äôm so much more content with life. being, i never once saw the end of the tunnel. i stuck it out, had to. but now i see that life is worth living even when it‚Äôs crappy because of the moments i share with my family, the good times i have. even if my mom and i fight again i know she loves me unconditionally and i know shed do anything  to protect me. Life looks up even in the darkest of times. I‚Äôve gone through a lot, abuse, torment, i have ptsd, and everything seemed like it was never going to end. but i promise it will at some point. people can tear you doen and even your closest family members hat you need in your life. but once tou stop caring about what they want and what they need, they no longer torment your life in that negative way. i was able to build a better relationship with my mom due to my girlfriend. i‚Äôm not saying people are to come in and change your life, but finding ehe right one to be by your side helps. but even if you‚Äôre alone. you have this. you can do this, you can stick it out a few more years tim you get away. your life is in your hands, not someone else‚Äôs, dont let them play you like that. figure out what you like and what you want even if you dont know thats okay. sometimes we have to be our own guidance. i used to resent my mom because she didn‚Äôt teach me how to be an adult. but that ‚Äòs not her fault, she taught me as best she could it was myself who didn‚Äôt stick with it. Find yourself, i know it‚Äôs easier said than done but you really have control over your own life even if it doesn‚Äôt seem like it.

depression,"At the worst stage of my depression I began to dismantle what I thought of as good and bad. I figured that the bad only existed as a result of what I thought was good and so if I began to let go of what I felt was making me happy I could lose the pain of feeling sad. I broke them down with logic into things which didn't mean anything to me (e.g. love is just a breeding mechanism). I did this for everything I cared about and I encountered this weird emotional silence. Just a flatline. All the opposites became one. It was everything and nothing at the same time I'm really not sure how to put it. It was good and bad. It was comforting and searing.  I was completely indifferent to everything. I felt psychopathic (I thought I was for a while) because I couldn't bring myself to have any genuine emotional reaction to anything. Good and bad emotion were equally terrifying to me because I knew they were interdependent. I would do things to confirm the way I felt and to keep my belief that there was no good or bad. I felt dead. Like there was no moment or place which was not nothing. But at the same time I felt everything but it had lost all sense of individual feeling. It just became one thing, it was nothing and everything at the same time. It was too terrifying for me to even approach that ball of emotion. If I tried to think about it I would just blank. Like I'd stare straight ahead (I'd be conscious) but there was just nothing inside. I'm not sure how or when, but I realised that while the way I felt made me do things, in exactly the same way the things I did were maintaining my feelings. E.G. I was feeling bad so I'd stay in bed all day, and I was staying in bed all day so I was feeling bad. I figured that while I didn't know how to approach the emotion, I knew how to attack the effects of it. At first I couldn't do anything. I had to have comfort all the time. But then I realised that I didn't have to do it all. You don't go to a gym and lift all the weights at once. I reckoned that if I changed 0.000001% of my behaviour that is still something. I knew that I could make my bed. o I made my bed. And then I believed I could tidy my bed. I realised that discomfort was the same thing as happiness, and the more I tried to be comfortable, the less I was happy. o with very slow progress I tried to push the limits of how uncomfortable I could make myself. I found the less comfortable I could make myself, the more actual happiness I could feel. I found that it made me uncomfortable to be honest, to say no to people, to be authentic in general. The bigger the scary thing that I tried to do, the more of my life I re-unlocked. I began to care again. I realised that you don't have to do it all at once. This is the most important thing I want you to remember. Depression makes itself seem like one big big thing which you have to solve all at once and which you can never get to, but it's neither of those things. Its lots and lots of little things which you can solve at whatever rate you feel comfortable with. Your ability to overcome increases with every little victory. Another lie depression will tell is that one weak moment undoes everything you have achieved. What utter bollocks. Then after learning how to go through the physical discomfort more, I was able to begin approaching that big ball of emotion with more bravery, and with the knowledge that I had survived discomfort before. There's no need to rush any stage. In the end, you feel every emotion without being afraid of it. For me the depression didn't come from the sad emotions, it came from being beaten by them. But to make the first step was far less bad to me than the way I felt constantly. I never thought I would make it back to what I was. I was an addict, I had no empathy, I was addicted to comfort and I had no hope. Life will go back to normal, you just have to seek out discomfort. It's strange. The least instinctive thing to want to do when you're depressed is to seek discomfort. It's the only thing that helped me.What helped my depression.",1635301175,4062,788

depression,"I‚Äôve been thinking about death more quite frequently. As someone who has tried committing before, this is scary. I know when I get in this head space, the only way to come out is by doing an attempt. I live a very normal, high functioning life. I‚Äôm a 25 year old female, I work in the health field, I have a boyfriend who loves me, parents who care for me, siblings who would be devastated if I was gone. But it never seems like enough. I‚Äôve been having issues with my boyfriends friends not liking me, his mother not liking me. I‚Äôm still grieving the loss of my grandfather who I whiteness pass away last December. I lived with him. The one year anniversary of his death is creeping up and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll make it. I drive to work and think of different places where I could end things. I started making a list of people to write letters for. I drive over a bridge to get to work and even though it‚Äôs not particularly high, I‚Äôd hope the fall would do something to my body and I‚Äôd drown. I told my coworker how I wanted to check into a mental hospital, I asked about family medical leave, as if I‚Äôd come back to work afterwards. I hug my cats a little tighter, I can‚Äôt imagine living without them. Is it sad they‚Äôre the only thing keeping me here? I was just on vacation in Florida and thought about jumping off a balcony.

How could my grandpa leave me and think I could survive without him? My therapist can‚Äôt see me again until November 4th. I tried therapy again to prevent this. I failed.

depression,"I was discharged from a psych ward 2 days ago. I don't think I was ready to leave. I left a suicide note for my wife 6 days ago and ran out of the house, with the idea to never return. I ran out with no initial plan on how i would end it.5 hours later and 20km ran/walked I was spotted by the police walking as I was walking through the pouring rain. They cornered me and I co-operated. I was arrested, after being identified as a missing person (the police had been called by my wife), and then taken to the ER. 10 hours later i was admitted to a psych ward. I am high functioning AD, with depression, severe social anxiety, and mild tourettes syndrome. I arrived at the psych ward and was shown my room, given no information on where I actually was or how the place worked. I kept to my room until I was game enough to go out and explore. The psych ward was a 25 room facility, for ""youth"" (I'm 29). The doctors, staff and social workers couldn't have been nicer and more helpful, except for not explaining a single was the place worked. Myself having severe social anxiety meant it was very difficult to ask questions, so I had to really work out how the place worked by myself. I spent the next 72 hours there, being checked on in my room where I mainly stayed every 15 minutes by staff. We were allowed devices there so I just sat in bed and watched movies most of the time, and Netflix's quid Game (I dont quite get the hype of it). I wasn't allowed chargers so between my phone and Ipad one of them was charging in the nurses station constantly. explained my story to 2 different psychiatrists while there, a psycologist and multiple social workers. I explained that I was confident that the psych ward would really not be much help to me. I have for years and years had constant suicidal ideation, and explained that it was silly to ask me whether or not I wanted to kill myself but rather ask me the percentage chance of me doing it at that time. I have normalised suicide by fantasising about it so much that the thoughts dont phase me and it has become so normal I get confused when people have so adverse reactions to talking about it. I have been medicated for the last 3 years for my anxiety and depression with multiple different medications. Am currently taking pregabalin for my anxiety, which actually helps alot, and fluoxetine for my depression which has never actually helped.  my third day they asked me whether I would like to be discharged and I agreed, thinking I would be in my best interests so be home with my wife and children. I spoke to one more psychiatrist who agreed that the facility was more geared towards people with pyscotic/schizophrenia issues. I agreed and we decided it would be better left up to my own private psychiatrist and psychologist to manage my journey from here. I was discharged later that day, picked up by my wife and driven home.  been 2 days since I left and all I can think about is going back, not for the actual psychiatric help but just for that feeling that I was safe and had nothing to worry about. My current mood is about 5/10. 1 being ready to commit suicide again and 10 being the happiest i've ever been. I'm here at work, struggling. I'm lucky i'm my own boss otherwise I would be in alot of trouble right now. I have no energy, no motivation and am fantasising about being back in that psych ward again.  could keep going on and on about this experience, and myself, there is alot more to it, but again i'm left just wanting to go back. That unit will not be able to provide the help I need, I need someone to take my brain and chop out the whole idea of suicide, but I dont know how that will ever happen.

depression,"this will probably be a lot of reading so you don‚Äôt have to read if you don‚Äôt want, i‚Äôd appreciate it a lot if someone did though, i just need to get shit off my chest. hell‚Ä¶ maybe somebody will even relate to it. idk been badly depressed on and off since i was 12 when i had to be the one to stop my mom from killing herself. suffered with an eating disorder my entire life that restricts me from doing a lot of things, had suicidal thoughts constantly. and within the past year, i had a girlfriend who knew me, who understood me, she had a lot of shitty things happening in her life as well, she helped me out mentally more than anybody could. but then as i expected, it all went away. i expected that they wouldn‚Äôt love me as much as i would love them and i was right, it hurts to be right all the time. she lost feelings and wanted to go back to friends. it hurt alot, but i was fine with still being friends with her because we‚Äôve helped each other out so much that she means alot to me as a person and i was okay with still having her around in my life. but i didn‚Äôt realize how hard and awkward it is to continue as friends after dating her for so long and acting like nothing happened between us. so i ended up ghosting myself from her. i didn‚Äôt realize then how much of a dickhead move that was.  got a tattoo afterwards because i‚Äôve been planning that for a while and i realized something. i never self harmed before, so i never understood the appeal, but when i got that tattoo, it felt good. really good. and that scared me because i realized how low i‚Äôve become, i didn‚Äôt want to start self harming. so i did everything i could to make myself a better person and work on myself and i can truely say that this past month, i‚Äôve felt a lot better surprisingly. no panic attacks, fewer breakdowns. i changed up my style, i hung out with friends more, i‚Äôm 16 so i built up the energy to study and pass my beginners driving test, started talking to family more, my confidence in myself is higher than it‚Äôs ever been. i texted her again yesterday after she missed a week of school and i realized how bad a choice i made to ghost myself. she was mad at me, and it was different because she has never been mad at me before. i realized i really hurt her by ghosting her. and knowing i hurt the girl who i loved for such a long time, and hurt the person that means a lot to me and has done so much for me, and they didn‚Äôt deserve it. i hate myself so much for that. she is going through a lot right now too so it makes it even worse that during a whole week of her missing school, i never even texted to check up on her, or even at least say hi. i did nothing. i couldn‚Äôt get myself to. and she doesn‚Äôt trust anybody enough to reach out to anybody else. i‚Äôm the person she really trusts and i left her in the dark during a shitty time. and i‚Äôm such an asshole for that. i wish i would‚Äôve at least texted. day today she was either really friendly with me, or she didn‚Äôt want to talk to me, i don‚Äôt know what to think anymore. i was talking to her in school and she seemed okay, i apologized and made it clear that i made a mistake, she deserved an apology. then just a few hours ago after school, she texts me asking if i was going to somebody‚Äôs party on the weekend and i said i was and she seems angry at me again for some reason. it‚Äôs so weird. i‚Äôm not going to get drunk and blackout and be all dumb, she knows i don‚Äôt drink. i‚Äôm literally going just because my friends are and i‚Äôm literally going to be sober the entire time. so i don‚Äôt know why she would be mad at me after literally talking to me all day in school. i don‚Äôt understand any of it. it‚Äôs just kind of eating me up inside. i just want her to know that i do care about her, i know ghosting her for a while doesn‚Äôt really help me prove that but i do care. i don‚Äôt know why i did that and i regret it so much. i know i was an asshole for doing that but i don‚Äôt want to be like that anymore. i just don‚Äôt understand how she can be mad at me, then happy with me, then mad at me again within 24 fucking hours. it‚Äôs so strange.just a rant about things going on right now cause i wanted somewhere to say something",1635294340,4175,840

depression,"orry in advance for the long post. I just need to vent somewhere to get the burden off. I moved to this city years ago and I think it was the worst best decision my parents have ever taken because  I haven't travelled much out of my province or even my city really, but I hope to on day. I moved here in the beginning of grade 9 leaving all my middle school friends which i know usually don't last and my family, But ever since I moved here from grades 9-12, my life has been absolute garbage. My life pretty much consisted of going to school, coming home and staying in my room. I made some friends but they were only friends in school. I'm going to be 18 in a few months and graduated high school a few months ago and I've never been to a party, hung out with friends, am still a virgin while everyone my age is out partying every weekend, doing drugs, going to prom, having sex, going on adventures and travelling with friends and it just makes me sad. I know that people are going to say that these things are overrated, but I don't really care because I want to do those things as well instead I'm in my room, no friends and alone for the past 5 years watching netflix and playing video games to escape reality. Also, making friends in this city is really hard because they usually have had their friends since they were in the first grade and have always lived here while I've been moving constantly and have been to 3 high schools in four years. I'm taking a gap year right now and working full-time to make some money and I will be living at home to save money which means life in university will also be the same. I guess I just need to accept my life for the way it is and that I will die a loser. I think if I don't wake up tomorrow I will be okay with it because then I won't have any of these worries and life will be done with and I don't plan on doing anything, but I will be absolutely fine with dying because my life is pretty much the same.My life is literally hell.",1635292983,1984,390

depression,"How are you supposed to become a self-sufficient adult when the people you're supposed to depend on the most are as responsible as fucking lobotomized teenagers?

How am I supposed to get a job myself that HA benefits when I don't have a car? How am I supposed to continue my education so I can get a better job with better insurance if I can't even afford to feed myself on a daily basis? country makes it practically fucking impossible to move up the ladder in a reasonable amount of time if you aren't already born with wealthy fucking parents.

You can afford to actually pursue and live a fulfilling life in what is allegedly the ""greatest country on earth""  if you're not? If your parents are unreliable and not financially stable?

I'm absolutely screwed and have been for the past decade, with the limited affection and acquaintances I have made and received end up imploding, unhealthy or fall apart. It's beyond hopeless, with my confidence, self-worth, spirit, and mental health staying the same or steadily getting worse and more painful. More complex trauma affecting me and my core being.

I want to reintegrate back to society but I'm finding it hard to associate with normal people. It's like every one wants nothing to do with me anymore. I'm finding it hard to make normal friends and the only people who want to associate with me are people still in the game.

depression,"Ugh so this might sound like nothing bad but it‚Äôs really affecting me. o buckle in because I haven‚Äôt talked about it to anyone and Reddit is my best anonymous outlet. I‚Äôm in my last year of university. All my housemates last year were in their final year. The house was shit but we all got along so well (all female) and clicked because we were all laid back and very tolerant. This year as their courses have ended, I‚Äôve had to move in with people I didn‚Äôt know. Two females. One of them is lovely and sweet - the other one‚Ä¶ seemed lovely at first. he made me feel welcome and opened up to me about no longer being on the course because of poor grades and about past housemates that have left them in debt and shit situations. I thought we were getting along great, even though I walked in on her bitching about ‚Äúsomeone‚Äù a few times. he always stopped abruptly when I walked in and I began to wonder if it was me she bitched about. I just assumed I was being paranoid as we would laugh and watch films together, and that she must be talking about a former housemate who they‚Äôve had trouble with.  then 3 weeks into me staying here, I went on a night out with people from my course. My first and only night out so far this academic year. I came back in the middle of the night extremely drunk and made myself some toast. I accidentally set the fire alarm off because I burnt it. It rang for about 10-20 seconds before stopping. I left a couple of dirty dishes out but nothing extortionate and nothing I hadn‚Äôt seen done already on that house. The next day, hungover, I woke up to a tirade of nasty aggressive messages from this one housemate saying I left the kitchen a mess (literally 2 dishes‚Ä¶ like I‚Äôve been in student houses that have been so much worse) and berating me for using her sponges for washing up. In all my previous houses cleaning utensils were always shared it‚Äôs always just been a mutual understanding so I didn‚Äôt even think that this would be any different. I would not have minded being corrected were the messages not so harsh and nasty after I thought we‚Äôd been getting along for so long. he excused her shitty mood with the fact that the alarm woke her up, and demanded I give an apology, which I gave willingly. I felt shit about everything and so guilty, but was determined to be civil because we live together and also I can‚Äôt do conflict. I can‚Äôt be at odds with people for long it just tears me apart.  opened up to these people about a lot of my anxieties and history with mental illness. What is more, because we are no longer officially a student house, with her having to withdraw, we now have to pay council tax, which she insisted we all split between us, even though we were signed up for it before I moved in, I wasn‚Äôt warned beforehand that I‚Äôd have to pay it, and I‚Äôm a student so shouldn‚Äôt be paying it anyway. I haven‚Äôt said one thing to complain about it but I just feel like I‚Äôm being made to feel unwelcome and unwanted in a house that I‚Äôm paying council tax for, despite me having done my very best to bond with both of them (and I can‚Äôt stress enough the other girl is lovely but they‚Äôve been friends for years and I feel like it‚Äôs almost a clique situation and no one else living with them is going to be allowed to get close to them.) is all just so weird to me because I have always gotten along with my housemates but this doesn‚Äôt even feel like a student house. I‚Äôm not overly messy or overly noisy, and I think it‚Äôs unfair to expect total silence from ten or eleven onwards in a student house in a student village. I don‚Äôt talk loud, I don‚Äôt disturb boundaries. I just feel like that one incident with the fire alarm has made her mind up about me and she‚Äôs not willing to change it.  literally grovelled and finally cleared the air with her a few days later which brings us to today. I put my (small) load in the washing machine whilst one of her clothes were already in there, and put it on a small wash (was an emergency I‚Äôd just dirtied my shit) and she sent me a rant about why I‚Äôd done it, claiming it might shrink her shit (it didn‚Äôt) and flat out calling me stupid, an idiot, and refusing to heed any of my apologies. I would be more understanding but she and the other housemate have done this exact thing with my washing multiple times. I‚Äôm so sick of the passive aggressive and downright aggressive rants, plus she never confronts me in person which really angers me. It‚Äôs always by message, even though our rooms are next to each other. I‚Äôve been crying for the past few hours because I feel so unwanted and unwelcome in this house, and I miss the old house and my old housemates so much even though this house is better quality.  really really want to move out and perhaps go looking somewhere else but I‚Äôm terrified of the inconvenience it will cause my family, and the girls living here. I keep wondering whether the problem is actually me because I can‚Äôt seem to do anything right here. just wanted to know the perspective of an outsider reading this because I‚Äôm so miserable here and I‚Äôm scared to tell anyone because I‚Äôve never changed accommodation mid-academic year and I know that even if I suggest it I‚Äôll cause so much inconvenience. I told my parents I was happy here because at first I was, but things went downhill so quick and I don‚Äôt know if all the anger and aggression towards me is justified or not. Paying council tax is bad enough as I have no money, but I wouldn‚Äôt even mind if I was made to feel like I was welcome in the house. I‚Äôm scared to leave my bedroom because I feel so unwanted and in the way all the time all this anger towards me justified? Am I being over dramatic? Im sorry to post this long thing but I don‚Äôt feel like I have anyone to talk to because I don‚Äôt want to let people down by expressing my longing to move out. I have never ever adopted a hostile or aggressive tone in the group chat but I‚Äôm so sick of getting called stupid.

I just went to college because I wanted to doge work. I never take responsibility for my own actions. I hate myself for that, but I don't change. I just fall back into my depressive episodes and keep blaming myself. I get constantly anxiety attacks of falling college and being a disappointment to my mother. I am only a burden to my own mother and I just can't take it to see her trying to help me. All her efforts are in vain for a miserable being like me. was never in a relationship in some sort. My crippling low self esteem makes me unable to socialize with anyone. I isolate myself so I cannot hurt people I interact with.

In the past I seeked shelter in the dopamine rush after masturbating to get me going through the day. But I cannot escape the cycle, even though it makes me physically sick. I always have the urge to vomit if I fall back into my additive patterns. But I cannot escape them. Half a year with zero progress. It feels impossible to get out there. I bit the bullet and seeked help by my mom. The problem is, she does believe in god and here advices are always to search for help from god. I am a non believer and I struggle to stay sane. I have the desire to hurt myself for my own stupidy to even be there in the first place. I also fear sharing this with people around me will just lead to them distancing from me.  feel like a failure, life wasn't very harsh to me, I have a caring mother and my school life went over smoothly. I even enjoyed it. But now I feel like a empty shell. The urge to kill myself keeps growing and I constantly get mental breakdowns. I don't see another way out, I am just merely incapable to do anything. I do not think that I am worthy of being alive. The more I fall into my depression the more I fell like human garbage.

I‚Äôm 19 and am currently a junior in college and I just feel shitty. You know? I just feel so exhausted all the time for no reason. I don‚Äôt sleep well anymore. I barely go to class and am basically failing half of them. I sleep pretty much at random intervals now and my memory is just absolutely atrocious. I can‚Äôt remember names or things I would literally say minutes before. It‚Äôs so bad that I can spend an entire day studying for an exam only to start it and realize that my mind is drawing blanks. It‚Äôs incredibly discouraging to see my grade on every quiz or exam I take now to the point where I just wonder what the point is in trying anymore. I truly feel as if there is basically no point in getting out of bed anymore. It‚Äôs bizarre that I feel like this too, because there‚Äôs no reason for me to feel sad and shitty. I have good friends and a wonderful girlfriend so it makes me feel even guiltier that I feel this way. Looking back on high school me, I feel way dumber too. I genuinely feel stupid now and that I‚Äôm not even cut out for college anymore. I feel like my parents would definitely feel disappointed in me if they knew how bad I‚Äôve been doing in school as of late, but at the same time it‚Äôs my own fault at this point because I no longer feel as if I can drag myself out of bed to go to class anymore. Even just showering or brushing my teeth sounds exhausting and I used to have really really good hygiene. I haven‚Äôt even felt like doing laundry in god knows how long. I find that I haven‚Äôt really been interested in anything I used to enjoy as well. It sucks because I spent a lot of money on a gaming computer a while back and I don‚Äôt even use it anymore.

I‚Äôve felt like this for quite a while now, although I‚Äôd definitely say that the past couple of months I‚Äôve been feeling way worse (I asked my girlfriend how long she thinks I‚Äôve been noticeably feeling like crap and she said like 2ish months, but that‚Äôs because I‚Äôve been more open with her about how I‚Äôve been feeling lately. I‚Äôd say that I‚Äôve probably felt like this since around the time I started college). I do have a history of self harm. I think? As a kid I would scratch my arms as hard as I could whenever I felt sad or frustrated. I‚Äôd say that I‚Äôve probably done it again for a few times in the past month, but I guess it‚Äôs not nearly as bad as people who self harm with razor blades and stuff. I‚Äôm rather squeamish around blood so I definitely don‚Äôt think I have it in me to slit my wrists. What I find especially weird is that I can go through a good portion of my day feeling decent, and then all of a sudden feel like I‚Äôm on the verge of tears, yet I can‚Äôt cry. I have also noticed that I‚Äôve been gaining a pretty good deal in weight recently, and feel disgusted with myself.My girlfriend, who has experience dealing with her own anxiety and crippling phobia, and who has years of therapy under her  belt, says that I should see a psychiatrist, but I really really don‚Äôt want to go. For one thing, I feel uncomfortable seeing doctors and talking about my problems. Even just admitting that I might have a problem just feels weird, if that makes sense. Another thing is that I‚Äôm under my parent‚Äôs insurance plan and I‚Äôd rather not see a professional using my insurance, only for my parents to get an insurance notice in the mail. I don‚Äôt want them to know that I haven‚Äôt felt the greatest lately, and I really don‚Äôt want them to worry since they have their own problems and stuff to worry about. I also worry about being baker acted if I am completely honest with a medical professional. I know that there‚Äôs online tips like exercising or writing a schedule that could help with how I‚Äôve been feeling, but I really don‚Äôt think I have it in me to actually do them. I can‚Äôt even drag myself to my very expensive college classes that I pay for anymore, so what makes me think that i could even do that. I‚Äôm sorry for my probably incoherent ranting and for wasting anyones time reading this, but for those of you who don‚Äôt feel annoyed about my post, what‚Äôs your take on this? I feel terrible.bad memory. Weight gain.

depression,"I guess I did overreact a bit. The thing is, I found my purpose, but it's a double-edged sword: on one side I get to be the absolute immutable and unconditional support to those I love, on the other side it's extremely difficult to apply.

depression,"Hello, everyone. I was diagnosed with general anxiety disorder and depression about 6 years ago. I've been to therapy and went on Zoloft two separate times for about a year each time. I've done pretty well until recently. Due to some life changes and circumstances, and because of the onset of fall, I find my mind in the darkness of depression once again. It's been one thing after another this year, as I'm sure it's been for a lot of you. I've started seeing a therapist again, and am trying to decide whether to go back on Zoloft. I feel like I need something to get me back on track. It's been very helpful for me in the past, very little side effects. Mostly some brain fog/more forgetful than usual. Zoloft permanently affects your brain chemistry, which makes me hesitant to go back on it. My therapist recommended 5-HTP. I've smoked weed in the past and tried 1type of CBD oil. Does anyone on here have experience with natural remedy depression maintenance? Or with taking Zoloft long-term? I know these affect everyone differently, but I'm interested to know what your experiences with depression/anxiety meds and/or natural remedies have been. I hope you're able to find one good thing about today. Thanks in advance!Deciding whether to go on Zoloft again or try a natural alternative.",1635283028,1296,224

depression,"Hello, I'm new here. I think I'll just tell my story and my current situation. I already had suicidal thoughts when I was 11. One of the reasons for this was that my father regularly beat me and kept threatening to kill me. My family didn't have a lot of money back then either, which is why I was the only one in my class not to have a cell phone. Even as a child, that made me mentally exhausted. The only thing I had was a TV and a gifted Nintendo D that kept me moving from my problems but also getting addicted. I didn't have many friends, but still they were better than nothing.  when I was 15 my parents split up. I was then given a lot of new things, a cell phone, a new computer, video games. I have a lot of time to myself because my mother works all day. At the time I thought it was great because I had a lot of freedom, but this loneliness has intensified my depression in recent years, even though I live the dream life I always imagined as a child. I no longer have such close contact with my old friends. I've always tried to write someone, but something inside of me is always preventing me from doing so. During those years I started talking to myself out of loneliness. It is now so bad that I can hardly control it when I am alone. And when I'm outside and very stressed, I also briefly start saying something uncontrollably. I also have negative thoughts on a regular basis, such as bad memories that embarrass me. These are so strong that they keep me from learning or training.  I distract myself on the Internet because these negative thoughts only hurt. ince I'm mostly either on the phone or on the computer, that affects my appearance. I have such dark circles under my eyes that they destroy my self-confidence. Again and again I tried to do something about it, but I always fail. I wanted to seek help. But who can I ask? Even if I dared tell my mother that, she probably wouldn't know what to do next. And I don't want to burden you or my friends with that. I also had the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãprofessional therapy, but it is so difficult to find a therapist near me who has time for me. A big obstacle for me are just these negative thoughts that make me do things that I don't want to. I automatically hit myself or suddenly start screaming whenever I think of an awkward situation. My suicidal thoughts kept coming up too. ometimes for a few days, sometimes for a few weeks. There were times when I made up my mind to go to the pharmacy and buy sleeping pills to overdose.  want to finally get rid of this pain that my subconscious is generating.

depression,I dont like asking people for help with anything its just the way I am. The only reason im posting here is because no one i know will find out its me.

My mom made me go out of the house and they were the only people who would even talk to me albeit to just make fun or abuse me.

I want to feel like i belong somewhere instead of just wanting to disappear. I dont even have the will in me to change my life even though i know i want to.

depression,"I‚Äôm just going to cut right to the chase. I‚Äôm really struggling mentally. These last few days have been an absolute nightmare and I‚Äôve started to fall back into a very dark place. I think however I have come to understand why. I feel I live a life devoid of love and affection. I have my discord friends that show lots of it but outside of that, I have nobody, I have nothing, I AM nothing with that screen turned off. I couldn‚Äôt sleep last night so I decided to do some digging and I found something eye opening. People who were often excluded from activities as children, people who had no friends growing up, people who have been through trauma after trauma, and so many other factors that pertain to my life that are all past experiences that indicate to me that I simply to this point have lived a life where nobody outside of the internet has shown they appreciate or love me. Clinginess to others, quickly to be upset over lost friends, are all symptoms that I go through that show me that I still feel like I‚Äôm simply just not loved outside of discord. feel growing up and really up until present day I have lived in a loveless family. Always fighting, always tension, and all everyone in my household does is make me the butt of their jokes. My parents growing up were very traditional and thus used physicality to discipline or to shame. While my parents don‚Äôt do that anymore now that I‚Äôm an adult, I still feel even though they try to show love, I simply cannot take it. I find that the relationship between my family members and I is permanently strained. I understand family is not a choice, and I understand that I myself and very dependent of them, partially because they made me afraid to take chances, risking myself messing up and them shaming me. for my childhood with other kids in school. From 5th to 10th grade, I never hung out with anyone. Not. One. Time. I was so lonely growing up. o growing up in a toxic household with no friends to bring me joy, I missed out on key years developing my social skills. It was in this time period that the abuse I talk about frequently began. Because I was so desperate for friends, so desperate to be loved, that I was willing to degrade myself just in an attempt that things would change and my need for love be fulfilled. I made three friends in high school, but at this moment in time, I know we are drifting apart, they are simply too busy, and our interests have started to change. Me with content creation, they with the party scene. It‚Äôs bittersweet that I feel this way. I do feel I‚Äôm losing the three good friends I have made irl, simply because times are changing. But while I do feel this way, this just means my craving for love and affection just becomes that much worse. talk about my desire for a romantic relationship quite frequently. o much so it pisses people off. I never quite understood why I was obsessed with the idea of having one. But the pieces came together for me over these last 3 days or so. I feel that having someone love me romantically for who I am, for what I am, will just be an amazing feeling. I understand I can‚Äôt rush into one and for the longest time I feel I‚Äôve been doing just that. But I discovered that that‚Äôs actually the opposite of whats happening. I feel I‚Äôm doing nothing to get one. I‚Äôm invisible to the world, I‚Äôm not putting myself out there. Nobody knows I exist. My self discovery was that I simply don‚Äôt know how to put myself out there. I have zero experience with romance and women. As much as I want a romantic relationship, to be with someone who loves me. I just don‚Äôt know how to do it. I don‚Äôt know how to get what I need in my life. For some people it just seems to come so easy. There are people my age getting married. Meanwhile as per usual I‚Äôm left in the dust, as I have been my whole life. Left behind to rot. I really wish I grew up in an environment that helped me understand this. Whether that be school or home. Both places I was shamed for simply having crushes on people. Girls at school made fun of me for liking them. But as weird as this us going to sound, I understand why they made fun of me. I was clingy. Furthermore I understand why I‚Äôm so clingy now too, it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm so drained of love that I just latch onto anyone that even gives me the slightest bit of kindness. This to me is just so sad and I have tears in my eyes as I‚Äôm writing this, because this has been the truth this whole time. I want a romantic relationship so badly and get clingy because I just have no sources of love outside of my computer. It‚Äôs really depressing typing all this out. It‚Äôs just getting harder and harder. creation, twitch, youtube, whatever, also factors into this. I get so much validation making content for everyone, for building up a community, that it makes me happy to bring people joy. This is why I‚Äôm addicted to discord and pushing myself to the extremes of pumping out content 4-5 days a week. I‚Äôve pushed myself to my limit because it‚Äôs the only source of love I ever get. Through a computer screen. It‚Äôs so nice finally interacting with people who truly give a damn about me. Even if it‚Äôs just saying hi. People have praised me for providing them so much good in their lives, through my community, through my content. Bringing others happiness makes me happy. But my wounds of my past and present are still very much there. Content creation is the one meek little band-aid covering all my gashes. Eventually the band-aid soaks and goes bad. Thus the pain just comes rushing back like it has over these last few days. The love I receive on discord is appreciated beyond words I can express. But it simply isn‚Äôt enough. Retreating to my phone or computer to get the love and validation I need simply isn‚Äôt healthy. Even discord however had had it‚Äôs ups and downs. For awhile I felt excluded on discord too, unwanted, unloved, and I guess in the end, that‚Äôs why I left the draft league scene. o online is also a very hit or miss environment. go out and do it yourself!‚Äù It‚Äôs not easy to go out and seek love when you‚Äôve been treated as poorly as I have over my 24 year existence on this Earth. I understand I let my past control me, but how could I not? All my life I‚Äôve been raised on pain and hurt. It‚Äôs all I‚Äôve known really until I created My online community. This is why my anxiety exists, my depression and anxiety fuel one another and as a result they grow exponentially big to where neither one can be contained. I just feel I‚Äôm at my breaking point and I‚Äôve simply been treating my deep cuts with band-aids hoping that would heal the wound but it hasn‚Äôt.  more I reflect on my life and analyze my past and present. The more I realize that my whole life I have been walking through hell not trying to get burned by its hottest fires. My happiness with content creation was that band-aid, my loveless past and present are the gashes that I need to treat. also feel my suicidal thoughts are coming back full force, but even with these I‚Äôve come to a realization. They‚Äôve never left. They‚Äôve always been there, dormant in the back of my mind, waiting to show their ugly heads. The truth, which is more devastating than I ever thought possible hit me like a truck when I realized it. For starters, I am on the autism spectrum, I have Aspergers, ADHD, all that. With me being on the spectrum comes challenges normal people don‚Äôt face on a day-to-day basis but I do. ocializing is one of these challenges. I still find socializing in person to be a huge challenge. I‚Äôve been trying to put myself out there more by going to clubs at my college. I‚Äôve been trying to put myself in uncomfortable positions that in the end I know will more likely than not benefit me. However another one of these challenges is my diet. I am the single most unhealthy eater I know because I‚Äôm very sensitive to textures of food as well as tastes. I have been pushed to try new things but I feel incapable of doing so. While that‚Äôs part of the truth it‚Äôs not the full truth. The full truth is I could go on a diet. I have started one once and I kept at it for a bit but I fell into my bad habits once again. The truth is‚Ä¶I have chosen not to. Not because I don‚Äôt want to. But because I want to be rid of myself in a way that doesn‚Äôt want require me to hurt myself in any way. That‚Äôs also why I haven‚Äôt gone to the gym in awhile. I have trouble motivating myself. I don‚Äôt want to challenge myself because in the end, I think I subconsciously don‚Äôt want to live anymore, but I don‚Äôt want to die either. o it‚Äôs like my whole life is being lived in a state of purgatory. All because I don‚Äôt feel loved or wanted enough in this world. It‚Äôs like its been drilled into my head, that I will never be good as everyone else. omeone will be better than me at everything and that means someone will be more lovable. guess love has been so absent from my life that I just don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs like anymore. To receive love is just such a foreign concept to me now. Especially since I feel for the most part I give, give, give, give, give, give, and give more love, but I don‚Äôt receive enough. honestly just done with everything, nothing is gonna change. It‚Äôs so hopeless.I live a life devoid of love and affection",1635281688,9226,1745
depression,"Ok I say. Everyone loves suggesting working out/eating healthy to help with depression. They don‚Äôt talk about the process, the journey it is. I acknowledge it can help.

God, it‚Äôs fucking difficult. And most times it doesn‚Äôt even help. I come back feeling the same goddamn way. Eating healthy and keeping up with that isn‚Äôt any easier. Many things people list as a quick guide to fixing depression aren‚Äôt even easy to start, do, continue. Mentally healthy people can have trouble doing that shit how the hell am I supposed to do it.

I cannot tell my parents, especially my mom, because she's one of my main reasons why I have this self doubts and she's been giving me emotional traumas as I grow up which eventually affected me as an adult.   really wanted to undergo treatment, it's just that I cannot afford it yet. o, I had many ways just to cope up. However, at the end of the day, it is still not enough. Although those ways helped me lessen the negative feelings, it wasn't enough to overcome the depression. As the year is almost over, my anxieties about surviving life as a whole is slowly creeping again inside me. I want to cry but I feel like a stone is also growing inside me. I don't understand this anymore. just want to vent this out.It's really hard when you can't afford treatment",1635276514,961,177
depression,"I'm diagnosed with ADHD, general anxiety disorder, and clinical depression. My depression feels only mild these days, but I still find it difficult to get out of bed and start my day unless I absolutely have to (ie. I will get in incredible trouble if I don't). I skipped my college classes today because I didn't want to go. I don't have a reason to not want to go, I just preferred sleeping. This happens to me all the time. I either skip things in the morning or I show up late tried 2 different phone alarm apps. I tried an app where you have to scan a barcode to get the alarm to stop and one where you have to get out of bed and walk to get the alarm to stop, I just end up deleting the apps if I don't want to get out of bed only thing that would get me out of bed now is someone forcing me out, but I don't have anyone to do that for me. I would greatly appreciate any advice on this matterHow do I get out of bed in the morning?",1635276435,937,192
depression,"o I've been dealing with very bad depression and anxiety now for 3-4 years. I've also had ADHD my whole life. I've only seen a couple psychologists. They didn't help at all. Even though the second guy I met with was retiring that year and talked about politics half the time in our sessions so I only saw him 3-4 times. Regardless, they were both psychologists and I think I realized I don't need a psychologist. I need either a therapist or psychiatrist. My gf has made is very apparent to me that I need to see help and she is right. I've been getting seriously bad. I came so close to buying a gun, because I had recently turned 21, so I could shoot myself in the head. I went to the gun store and was so close to buying one before my gf looked at my location then called to talk some sense into me. Anyways, I need to see someone for how bad this shit is. I want to see someone but I don't know what type of help I should go with, a Psychiatrist or Therapist.

depression,"My life has been a struggle for the most part, troubling past, dysfunctional family im stuck being related to, my mother is severely sick, my anxiety is high, i live in poverty, and of course i suffered through depression for over a decade and had mental health issues my entire life. As the tittle of this thread suggests, i feel bitter because of it. Ive had thoughts of death and suicide, plus ive had thoughts of hurting others by commiting violent acts to people that had fucked me over in life, and to people i dont particularly like, which is quite telling because i despise people and i have trust issues with people in general, including with people i knew for years. Intrusive thoughts come in all the time partialy because of my mental illness and emotional state, and i tend to think about the worst case senarios to happen when something goes wrong in my life because ive already been through too much in the past as it is, in fact, its more than i care to list on this post. Im making this post because ive had this mindset for the past few years and its not even remotely healthy. The only thing that seems to work is perscription medication and the use of cbd flower. o essentialy im just using drugs to get by, because of how much it keeps my sanity intact. I have a few things going good for me in life though, such as a place of my own, a stable job, and almost everything i need to survive. And all the while i may be feeling better because of that, i dont think im necessarily getting better. Otherwise i wouldnt have internal and external issues that i desperately need to resolve. Im almost positive that there will be essentialy no advice that anybody can give me, which is fine. Im kind of used to not getting the proper treatment i need anyhow, but it would still be nice to vent out my thoughts despite people not giving a fuck how i feel anyway.I feel bitter",1635275936,1886,352

And now, TUPID ME made a dumb sarcastic joke to him that really set him off yesterday. I apologized, he accepted it, but now this morning he says ""I don't know what having a best friend means."" to which I say ""You'll find out"" and he says ""I don't have one."" fucking hit me.

depression," I have been out of work and education for some time now. The other night it hit me that I have very few people in my life who understand this condition and I figured if I were to reach out, perhaps I would attract a few people whom are interested in chatting and feel less alone in all of this. o, for background info, I have suffered from social anxiety since I was around 12 years old, it all stemmed from being bullied by my so called friends and then peers. I have never really had a close friend, hence me searching on here numerous times. Before the bullying happened, I was quite an outgoing child and spoke to people without hesitation which makes me question whether I am introverted by nature as social anxiety seems to have taken over my entire personality, such words like ''introvert'', ''homebody'' etc seem to fit perfectly but it does make me wonder how different I would be without feeling this way.Mental illness is the most isolating and debilitating experience a person can face.",1635275719,1000,180

Just overwhelmed with everything day to day I take medicine but I'm currently struggling to afford and find a psychiatrist and or psychologist that's affordable especially since I have issues holding down work and my single mom wants to use my disability check to help around the house which I don't mind . I just have to think of a plan for dealing with everything on my plate. Currently have to deal with my sickly grandpa who's dying from Plumraory Fibrosis *misspelled sorry * as well as heart and liver failure . He has issues getting to the door and getting dressed because he felt like he was going to pass out.  He hasn't been wanting to eat either.  Today he went to a health center by the VA to be taken care of for a few hours.  It was just stressful , then the cats that we have made all over the floor , so I cleaned it up and did some chores and ate. I didn't take my meds and started making suicidal threats to my partner I wasn't really serious just overcome he tried helping which he did but I still feel overwhelmed with emotions.  I went in my room after my grandpa left and my cat was all over me and purring etc . And I socked her in the fact . I felt super guilty and just started crying and I just texted my manager that I couldn't go to work because of my grandpa and took today off. he was nice about it just that I can't miss tomorrow and text instead of set up 2 weeks in advance.  I don't mind going tomorrow from 12-7pm , I just wish it was more money especially I'm in debt with hospital bills and can't afford dbt therapy or the right psychiatrist care I want and if I go to a low income level I rather just have a psychiatrist than a therapist since most don't care unless you want to kill yourself.  I don't know if Texana or in Montrose TX Legacy you just can go for Psychiatrist and not a therapist? Anyways , I just feel guilty about not going to work especially since my grandpa can die at any moment.  I just wonder how can I numb my pain for today.

I was abused at home and also bullied at school. I stopped trusting people and stopped socializing for a long time. Also being depressed during my teens, a time when your brain is developing, held me back emotionally. I just don't have the same emotional intelligence as people my age (23).

I may not be the best version of myself, but I must have the decency to stand up for my own existence.

I don‚Äôt know what to do with myself, what to believe in, or how to change myself to get on the right path. I‚Äôm just completely lost. It‚Äôs like that scene in Blair Witch where they realize they‚Äôve been walking in a circle for days and there‚Äôs no way out of the forest. few years ago I went to rehab for two months in Utah to fight an opiate addiction, and I actually succeeded. I knew what I was getting into when I started, and my plan was to get high until the day came when I could just overdose and end my life. Long story short, my parents found out and I decided that I couldn‚Äôt break my mom‚Äôs heart, so I committed to recovery and tried turning over a new leaf. It was a brutal battle but I managed to kick it, somehow. always had relationship problems and when they go sour I tend to fall long and hard. I had a fling with a coworker recently and she got pregnant a few months ago.

depression,"I've never experienced happiness. Maybe slightly as a small child but probably ended around age 7. My parents were never married but tried to have a relationship for my sake. Didn't work out and they split. My mom got custody of me, and I have two other siblings who are half siblings. o my mom, my brother and my sister are living in a 3 bedroom townhouse. I was molested by one of my fathers girlfriends when I was around 10. I didn't understand what was happening nor did I believe it actually happened until my father confirmed it on the one of very few rare occasions I've seen him.. saying ""remember that crazy girl I used to date"" and then it hit me like a bag of bricks. All of it did happen. My father got married a couple years after that to a different woman of course.  I remember vividly that everytime I went to his wife's house, they would argue about me staying there. he hated me. I didn't understand at the time cause I'm you know like 8 or 9. I guess cause I'm the son of another woman. Their fights were really bad, I mean, throwing dishes and physical bad. o I didn't go to his house often. Actually, at all from there. I started therapy round age 10, also didn't understand that. All I understood was my mom was making me go to a place to talk about things I didn't want to talk about. At home since my mother was using working full time, my brother and sister watched me. Both of abused me. My brother hit me, my sister threw knives at me. Got to the point where I went and hid every knife in the house. I didn't do well in school and had really major anxiety and just couldn't function around other kids. Mostly because I  became the smelly kid in class. My mother was always working and stopped doing my laundry. I didn't know how to do laundry in the 5th grade. I remember once the whole class sat on the other side of the room, the teacher included and I sat alone while the teacher taught the whole half sided classroom. All of this just made me not want to go to school at all.. I did everything I could to skip school. My grades fell, and I was forced to repeat the grade. This repeated again the following year. And then again, the third time I was forced to pass because I was too old. Growing up I had the same three friends  and they're all brothers so I would just spend all my time at their house playing video games. Their parents hated me as well, they were racist as my friends explained but allowed me to come over sometimes. They used to live a couple houses down, then fast forward a few years and now live 45 mins away by car. I'm 14, I don't have a car, I get on the bus which takes 3 hours to get there. They're my only friends so I don't mind. The very first day I see them since they moved a few months ago, their dad says "" what are you doing here, you didn't ask to come over go home"" so I went outside and started crying it took me 3 hours to get there. That was pretty much our relationship our entire time until they've moved out a few years later. I always wanted to be away from home because of my siblings. As I got older and my siblings got older my sister got into drugs real hard, as did my brother. My sisters story is a little sadder than most, her father died when she was around 4 or 5. When she became 18 she got a life insurance settlement all at once. It was over $200,000. he spent all of it in 2 years of cars, drugs, and was scammed from one of her best friends in a check scheme. he went into drugs hard-core, became homeless and was roaming the streets for money. My mother was always trying to help her, always. Even dragging me along at 14 driving through ghettos trying to find her. Now she has schizophrenia and lives in a addicts program. I've never had a girlfriend, never experienced a first kiss or anything. I'm more than fine with that. It's just being feeling alone all the time that gets me. Even in a room full of people. Even around my small family. I feel extreme alone. I'm 29 without any friends, barely any family, nothing to my name or anything. Housing prices  has made it extremely hard for someone my age to own anything.. especially in the area that I live in.. where rent costs an average of $1,500. I know I'm still fortunate for many things so I'm always looking at the bright side. I do nothing but smoke weed and go to weed. I know the weed is a problem financially but I've been smoking for years its the only thing that relaxes me and literally helps me sleep at night.  I just don't want to do it anymore. I'm longing for human interaction but i just don't think it was meant for me. I can't feel accepted anywhere by anyone I'm tired of looking. Tired of working as well, I'm a very talented cook and only seem to get entry level jobs that don't respect me as a human or want me to work as if I'm a robot. They say there's steps to suicide like, just a thought, to planning it out, I may be a few steps in.As cliche as it sounds",1635263581,4930,960

depression,"o I have been a part of the Digimon TCG community for a while a few months supporting and playing their new game which is hitting its 1 year anniversary soon. I noticed early on a lot of people are seemingly ""stealing"" (tracing, redrawing, and copying) artwork to use in products they are making and selling to others with success. I have the ability to make my own and try to be distinct about doing something similar and when I tried the same type of thing I seemingly got singled out for being in the wrong and have stopped because I was told to privately by many others doing what I was doing was wrong. I rarely have done any art sense then and still see people ""stealing"" work and selling it with varying degrees of praise and success for the past few months as they are not getting basically bullied out of doing what they want.  forward to this past week I make a public post about how stealing is wrong and basically illegal after asking the copywrite subreddit about it so i can try to get many facts straight (and was told off by the person helping me thinking i was trying to start drama when i just wanted understanding of what is and isnt allowed as it is a big legal grey area) and we should encourage others to be better and not steal, not wanting others to get in trouble like I have. I am then met with a LOT more backlash more than I was anticipating and people are seemingly attacking me for asking others not to steal. All this backlash is really getting to me as the more i think about it the worse my mood gets gets. I just want to be a part of a community to have fun and seeing all this theft and people in praise and support of it is really starting to wear me down as i obviously couldnt do the same thing as people point out that I did and it is wrong while simultaneously praising others for doing basically the same thing. I acknowledged and grew from my mistakes (or at least trying to). I am not trying to attack anyone specific and yet is seems like everyone attacks and hates me now because I wanted to speak up on an issue seeming plaguing the community for longer than I thought.  really dont know what to make of the situation but it is really getting to me. I really dont want to quit and i dont want to block people either as i dont think that will solve anything. But the whole thing blew up in my face from what i thought was good intentions is now making me second guess, doubt myself, and but a huge damper on my mood eating up all my free thought as i ponder what to do next. I know people didnt like me in the past but seeing people who i thought i can trust turn on me was a bit shocking.

depression,"I've not had a super difficult time the past year or two, and it should've been manageable for me but I've just been falling apart. I don't really have any ambition or motivation to go out and do things, and I don't really see myself having a future. Every time I think about it I imagine that I'll probably kill myself in a couple of years or later, depending on whether or not I've completely given up. I'm too scared and worried about the pain of doing it, and so I don't think I'll kill myself right now.  now though, I live a hedonistic lifestyle that a part of me doesn't really want to change. I play video games, watch youtube, order doordash whenever I feel like it, and don't really look for long-term anything. I have a relatively easy job at a fast food restaurant that I can just go through the motions with. I don't really talk to anyone or connect to people. I'm really quiet, but I try to be polite or 'laugh' if they saying something funny. I don't talk to family, and I don't reach out to chat with anyone except maybe one friend, but that's just to talk about videos games.  rarely speak to my parents and we're not really on good terms. I don't live with them anymore as well. The worst thing I've been doing recently is completely fucking up my sleep schedule. I stay up to around 8am-9am constantly and I find it hard to ever want to go to sleep. leep is nice, but I hate the feeling of waking up. Knowing that time has moved forward and I'm still behind. I just like to spend as much time as possible in my escape of video games and youtube. This causes me to be 1 hour-40 minutes late to work pretty frequently and I'm lucky my employers are chill about it, but I'm sure they hate it. My only saving grace is that I want to do a good job when I'm there, so I still try hard to perform at my job. the job though, I've got nothing going for me. I dropped out in my sophomore year, I think it's been around year now since then. I was pretty lost after that and all I really did since then was work, quit my job, work some more, and obtained my hi-set which is equivalent to a GED. I've heard a lot from family and what I've read online that the next best step for me is to go to college. People with degrees earn a lot more and all that, but the reason I quit highschool was because I was so lazy and unmotivated every day that I never got anything done. I just never did any work and watched the whole sophomore year go by as my grades plummeted in every class I took because I never did anything. This happened towards the end of my freshmen year too, but I got a freepass then. I was in honors classes too and it wasn't like I was incapable of doing the work. It's just gotten so much worse over these couple years. feel like I'll just live like this for a couple more years until I'm forced out of my home, and I'll be homeless for a while. I hope I can kill myself then because being someone who completely failed is everything I didn't want to be. I'm kind of a perfectionist and I've always been very hard on myself as a kid, I never saw anything really worth pursuing besides being successful or happy in some regard.  haven't officially been diagnosed with depression, but I just don't see how it couldn't be. I have nothing but time anymore that I just waste day after day. I went to a counselor for a couple sessions, 4 I think, after my parents figured out I was suicidal by browsing my internet history. During that period I was failing school and getting yelled at constantly I had more intent than ideation although I never went through with anything. That was about a year or two ago from now. I think if I continue as I am I'll only get worse so should I look into therapy or something. I'm scared to contact my doctor on my own, but I feel like I just keep spiraling downwards slowly without doing anything to change it.

Nor has the amount of quality time spent together, which is what I need from them.  depression has always been a thing and we've dealt with it in strides.

They're not happy with the progress we've made in our relationship (sometimes seem unhappy with outside of it too). Asking when it will get better. I took some precautions and put away any sharp objects and medications that could be dangerous. With their approval that is...  few days later I asked to talk about what we could do for eachother. They had nothing to add and started telling me a story of how they drive behind semi trucks with heavy machinery, or make sure to have the exact amount of pills. I asked if there is anything they have that I should worry about... an insult pump. That I cannot take from them...  say they can't do ""this"" anymore. When I ask if they mean the relationship or life I get nothing.  tried to suggest maybe checking into a place and getting some additional help.

I can‚Äôt talk to my parents about my problems because my dad is also suicidal so speaking to him is just depressing and whenever I bring up my mental health to my mum she threatens to kill herself if I ever commited suicide‚Ä¶ so I feel like I‚Äôm being guilt tripped into staying alive. much as it sounds like I‚Äôve completely given up, i still have some hope and want to get my life back‚Ä¶ i just don‚Äôt know how.

Finally thought it was all over.. but it seems like it never is. ometimes I really wish somebody would take the time to convince me I am not broken. But maybe I am. Maybe a big part of me is gone and it just won't be the same anymore, but it sucks man. I went full circle. Back to suicidal thoughts, back to not believing in getting better.

depression,"Ever since Covid quarantine started, I've felt like my motivation to do anything has disappeared, I've found it harder and harder to really enjoy things, and I've felt less and less confident in myself. When I look at these symptoms, obviously it sucks, but it's reassuring to know that, with time, I can alleviate all of them and return to my normal self eventually. What has me seriously concerned, however, is my recent failing memory. I'm only 18, but it feels like I'm losing my mind. I will be talking with my friends and it's just such a struggle trying to articulate even the most simple concepts. Constantly, I'll be reaching for words as I'm speaking and it almost feels like the words are there in my brain, but they're out of reach and I have to sit and pause for a few moments to reach them. I listen to the way my friends speak and they don't pause, they just say what's in their mind and complete the sentence without any trouble. ometimes I try to reach for the words and it takes me so long that I just give up trying to finish the sentence. It's gotten to the point where many of my friends will listen to what I'm saying and literally know what I want to say before I even do. ometimes I look at a character from a show I've been watching for years, a character that I love and have talked about countless times before, and I just can't think of their name, like it's a blind spot in my brain. That's just one example, but it happens for all kinds of things. Just in general, it feels like my mental efficiency has been brought down to 30%, like my thoughts have been weighed down. It's so frustrating and terrifying. I'm almost certain that this is all due to depression, I never used to feel like this, but it's too scary to just ignore. I'm extremely afraid of Alzheimers and dementia, just the thought of your brain slowly falling apart and your memories disappearing makes me feel ill, so all of this is especially frightening to me. I just want to know if there's anyone out there who has felt this before and can tell me that, if I manage to overcome depression, my mind will go back to working like it used to.Having a terrible time remembering things I know I should remember and sometimes even just finishing my sentences.

I've spent the last several years trying to start a proper career but can't get my foot in the door anywhere, just keep getting rejected and ignored by employers over and over and over again. I tried going back to school but couldn't even finish the degree. I'm stuck working dead-end jobs which I can't even seem to keep due to depression. I quit my last job before they could fire me because I was having an episode where I felt suicidal and couldn't get out of bed. o even if I got my dream job I wouldn't be able to keep it.

I'm stuck in this cycle of failing over and over without making any progress; meanwhile my peers have successful careers and relationships, lives they don't have to be ashamed of. never been in a relationship. Every girl I've ever asked out has turned me down. It's hard to maintain any self esteem when all I face is repeated rejection.

That is if they don't leave immediately after seeing all the red flags I'm surely waving around. Can't hold a job, never been in a relationship = there must be something wrong with this guy (and there is, it's the fucking depression). depression even feels like it's gotten even worse over the years despite all the medication and therapy I've been through.

depression,"Does anyone else experience inability to focus and a blank mind (especially during conversations)? I've had depression on and off since I was a teen, and as a result of that and anxiety, I barely socialized and spent all of my free time in front of a computer screen. Before the depression and anxiety, I was a normal, socially-adjusted, and outgoing kid. Now, I can go the whole day without talking to anyone and to be honest, it's been a while since I had a conversation lasting more than 10 minutes. But the thing is, most days, I don't feel a need to talk to anyone. While I don't feel particularly depressed right now, I feel like my mind is still blank most of the time.  someone is talking to me, I lose focus like everything is going in one ear and out the other. And even if I don't feel anxious, I usually have nothing to say. Even trying to speak my opinion on something is hard. Also, I could read an interesting article online but when I sit down and talk to someone it's like I ""forget"" everything. Responding to basic questions, like yes or no questions, is fine but beyond that it's very difficult to come up with a coherent response. When this happens I usually ask a lot of questions or answer with something lame or off-topic or say nothing, which makes it seem like I have no personality. This makes conversations very awkward and kind of painful for both parties. I don't think most other people are like this because they generally have a lot to say and can talk for hours. of my biggest fears is that years of anxiety and depression have damaged my mind irreparably. I'm scared that I won't be able to fix this even with more socializing and less screen time. If anyone has experienced this and improved their blank mind, help would be much appreciated.How to improve blank mind ( esp. during conversations)?",1635243473,1831,334

Instead we live in a world of little people, even grown men, small, fucking pathetic piece of shit excuses for humans that are too cowardly to use outright aggression and instead prey on people like the weak pussy boy I used to be with passive aggressive tactics of psychological destruction because misery loves company. as much as I damn myself for ever being so weak in the past, I damn myself for not being that beautifully minded boy anymore, who always had a warmth within him, instead I am a man with an old body I don't want, who lusts for things I've come to desire but now elude me, and feels the same wrath I saw in others as a boy and swore to myself I would never possess and yet here I am starting to live in fear of myself and what demons from my subconscious are starting to become manifested in reality.  wanna go swim with the fishes, because at least then it will be over, I won't have to drag myself through yet another day of coping, of mourning, of working for money that I know will never make me happy, of going to bed alone, of being jealous of other people who have what I want but can never seem to have. urely there is room in hell.I missed absolutely everything good about being in your 20s",1635240562,2827,543

depression,"Hello there, I have never posted on Reddit before but I have lurked for many moons. Not sure what the ins and outs of Reddit are or If im breaking some cardinal rules or if this is Posted in the right thread etc etc. Just thought I would get some stuff off my chest in case anyone has some profound life advice for me. I‚Äôm (28F) and have no family. My mom passed away suddenly and tragically last year from covid complications. They would not even let me be in the hospital with her. The funeral was small and rushed. I feel like I have no closure. We were very close, I think about and miss her everyday. I have no other family no aunts cousins grandparents not even a distant relative that I know of. I have no kids and haven‚Äôt had a bf in over 5 years. My mothers husband is disabled and I have taken over caring for him (very resentfully and reluctantly). I had to leave my job to care for him full time and am now trapped because of Issues getting him into a nursing home I won‚Äôt get into here. I have only a handful of friends who all have their own busy lives. Everyone is getting married, having kids, getting promoted at work and living their best lives. They simply do not have time for me and do not care to try to make time for me. I don‚Äôt blame them either because clearly I‚Äôm going nowhere in life and they don‚Äôt need that negativity in theirs. My days are spent caring for my moms husband, laying in bed crying and feeling sorry for myself. I have been on antidepressants for 2 months and have not seen a positive change. It feels like a dark cloud over me that won‚Äôt leave. Just like those Zoloft commercials. I have no ambitions no goals and no plans. I have gained almost 30 lbs since last year when covid started. I rarely leave the house, I don‚Äôt move or walk and have no desire to. I just want to lay in bed and sleep. I‚Äôm stuck in a literal rut that I cannot get out of due to finances and the disabled man I‚Äôm taking care of. I have tried seeing a therapist online and had 2 bad experiences with 2 different therapists, so I‚Äôm giving up on that. I have no one to turn to or talk to, no family to fall back on, nobody to grieve with me. Only pal I‚Äôve had is my loyal doggo who is also old as hell and might not have much longer left. I try not to think about that. I‚Äôm not getting any younger, I just want to live my life again. I want to find a good man and start a family but it just doesn‚Äôt seem possible. The only person who ever loved and cared for me unconditionally is gone. My life is passing me by and it‚Äôs a scary feeling. There is more but I will end it here. Thank you for reading and I‚Äôm sorry for my grammar etc.No friends or family",1635240308,2668,529

August, my girlfriend abruptly broke up with me after 4 years. This being my first relationship, the break up left me in shock and sent me spiraling. Things have not felt the same since that day. I still miss her so much. I didn‚Äôt make a lot of friends in college so she was so incredibly important to me to a fault, to the point where we were essentially co-dependent.

depression,"Hi Reddit, this is just a rant. I dont really have anyone to talk to about this stuff.  been experiencing prolonged periods of depression and general anxiety since puberty. I think I am so used to feeling depressed and physically exhausted that its become my normal state. I fell into drug addiction for a few years but came out of it about 12 months ago. I still smoke heavily and drink occasionally, but I feel like the drug addiction did some damage to me in terms of my concentration and memory - (the weed probably doesnt help).  been through a lot of trauma and I was dreaming of being in the situation I am in now, my own place, own car, good job in IT and accessible health care, but I am still not happy. Most days all I do is go to work and sit in front of the computer, go home, smoke weed, sit in front of the computer/lay on the couch, sleep, repeat. I feel like I cant do this for the rest of my life. These mental diseases are hell, because they are invisible and people dont understand what they do to you, or they feel as if its just an excuse for being ""lazy"".  I am in the wrong field too, idk. I was a computer/gaming nerd since I was like 8 and I always wanted to be ""that cool IT chick!"" and I dont know if I've lost my passion or if the depression is making it seem that way. Right now I work for a MP as a technical advisor which isnt exactly the least stressful IT field.  reality I think what I really want is to work with animals (especially exotic ones) and I am still young but my career has just started and I am making good money for mye age.

depression,"I normally don't use reddit but I found this thread and I don't really have anyone to talk to about this kind of stuff. I am an 18 year old that goes to a community college I think that I am overall a pretty shitty human being. I am terrible at chool  I am failing every single one of my college classes  and i'm only going to college to make my parents happy. I want to goto trade chool to learn how to work on cars but my parents are the kind of people that say you need a degree to be successful in life. I don't think my parents really like me that much, we don't really share any common interests and i've always been known as kinda the ""fuck up child"" or bad child in the family, I have always gotten in trouble since I was in middle chool wether it be at school or with the police (nothing too serious). I slept around quite a bit throughout highschool and still kind of do so i have a ""fuck boy"" reputation, which is fair I'd say but its not really the image I want. I have cheated on 2 girlfriends  the first time I ended it a couple days later because I felt so guilty but I didn't tell her that was the reason and the 2nd time was pretty recent. I was dating this beautiful and smart girl that my sister introduced to me, she lived 4 hrs away but over the summer we made it work and we were visiting each other but when she started college we talked less and I had sex with another girl that I had dated in the past, I had 0 feelings for the girl i cheated on my gf with, I did it because I seeked pleasure over my morals. I still feel awful about it, my gf at the time never found out but she actually ended things with me a day after it happened (Karma right?) and I didn't really fight it because I wouldn‚Äôt be able to live with the guilt. I think that I was seriously starting to fall in love with this girl she was pretty much everything I look for in a female, she was so smart, extremely pretty, she made me want to be a better person when I was with her, and she showed me what kindness and compassion looked like. We still talk as friends but its not the same, I still feel kinda guilty when talking to her because she deserved so much better and to be treated right. When we broke up I didn‚Äôt tell my parents for a few weeks because I was so embarrassed that I got broken up with, my mom really liked her. I think another reason why I had such a connection to this girl is because while we were dating two people in my life passed away, one of my friends overdosed and my grandmother passed away. he helped me get through both of those, and that all happen over this last summer. This breakup was probably extra hard because my brain made a correlation to losing those people tied to her and when I lost her I lost the one person I could talk to those things about. I have two friends both named Ryan so we are calling them Ryan 1 and Ryan 2 . Ryan 1 is 19 and he is a successful cars salesman, he drives a $70K car and makes $25K a month. Ryan 2 is a borderline drug addict that has had a pretty rough past growing up in foster care and such, he now lives on his own in an apartment. They are both  pretty good friends overall. Ryan 2 is pretty selfish and doesn‚Äôt really care about other humans, (understandable for his past). Ryan 1 makes Ryan 2 and I feel like failures all the time (Not on purpose) but just because he is so much more successful that us. Now that you have background on the two of them, I feel like I can't talk to either of them about any of this stuff because neither of them really have to social skills to respond to all of this, it would probably be asking to much of them and i've kinda just made peace with that but this world feels lonely with nobody to talk to about this stuff.

depression,"Edited to add: I doubt anyone will read all of this. I was hoping it would be therapeutic but it really just made me feel worse. orry for any typos, or incomplete thoughts. I can‚Äôt bare to proofread it. It was hard enough typing it to begin with.  suffered from depression since I was 12. I hear about people all the time that are depressed because of a chemical imbalance in their brain and that‚Äôs tragic. I can‚Äôt imagine having a good life but still being sad just because your body doesn‚Äôt produce the right chemicals. At least for those people there may be medications that could make them feel better. My depression on the other hand is all because of events in my life. I‚Äôm 45 years old and the way I look at it there have been three phases of my depression. I had a decent childhood until the age of 12 and that‚Äôs the beginning of phase 1.  1.**  the summer when I was 12 years old my dad (who I would later find out was not my real dad) went away for a couple of months for job training. This was the late 80s and back then we had no internet, most kids didn‚Äôt have video games, and we didn‚Äôt have 200 channels of things to watch much less streaming services. o I spent a lot of time out with my friends riding bikes, building clubhouses in the woods, etc. I usually stayed out until the street lights started humming and flickering on. One day I came home a bit earlier than usually and there was an unfamiliar car at my house. I went inside and my mom was sitting in the kitchen and there was a guy I had never met sitting in the kitchen with her. he introduced me. He told me a few lame jokes and he left. He came back several times over the next few weeks and I really didn‚Äôt think much of it. I just thought this was a friend of my mom.  some reason when my dad would call she wouldn‚Äôt let me speak to him and then the week before he was due to come home my grandmother came to get me. I didn‚Äôt think this was odd because I would usually go and spend some time with them in the summer. I asked if I could wait at least a few weeks so I could see my dad before I left. My mom said no. o we got in the car and left. For some reason my grandmother was upset with me. he kept telling me that if I misbehaved at her house I would go to juvenile detention. I had no idea why she was speaking to me this way. My grandmother had never been so mean to me and I was very confused. I was a straight A student and had never been in any more trouble than any average kid.  stayed with my grandparents all summer. The whole time when I would call home my mom wouldn‚Äôt let me speak to my dad. he would always say he wasn‚Äôt home, even though I could hear him asking for her to let him talk to me. The summer ended and I started going to school in the town where my grandparents lived. Then one day, several weeks after school had started, I was laying in the living room floor watching tv when my grandmother turned down the TV and said, ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt get in trouble at school when you were living with your mom did you?‚Äù Of course I told her that I hadn‚Äôt. I would later find out that my grandmother spoke to the teachers at both my current school and she had even gone and talked to the teachers at my school back home. I would also later find out that the reason my mother sent me to live with my grandparents was because I had accidentally met the man she was having an affair with and they were afraid I would snitch on them. I was 12. I had no idea that was what was going on.  she was caught anyway and moved in with the new guy (hereafter referred to as The Asshole). hortly after she was caught my younger brother (4) and sister (10) also came to stay with my grandparents. They had to because The Assholes mother moved 2 hours away and he moved to follow her. After many months of all three of us being there my little brother and sister started crying all the time because they missed my mom. One day we were in the back yard and they were asking me when mom was coming to get us and I told them that she wasn‚Äôt coming to get us but that it didn‚Äôt matter because we had each other and our grandparents and that‚Äôs all that mattered. Well my grandpa overheard the conversation and he called my mom and told her that she should come and get us. he eventually did but only because she didn‚Äôt want to look bad to her parents. When we got to the city they now lived in they informed me that I would not be staying with them. They didn‚Äôt have room. I stayed with a guy The Asshole knew from work. This guy was only 20 years old. He and his girlfriend had parties all the time. At this point I was 14 years old and I was getting high and dropping acid with 20 something year olds and there were occasionally orgies that they didn‚Äôt let me participate in but I wasn‚Äôt required to leave. I saw and experienced things no 14 year old should. I eventually threatened to call my grandparents and inform them of my living conditions and mom and The Asshole found a place and came and got me.  the new place I had to sleep on the couch. I would often hear The Asshole and my mom fighting. The fights we very one sided. I could hear him beating the shit out of her and sometimes even slamming her into the wall so hard it shook the whole place. One day she got tired of it and told the wife of The Asshole‚Äôs boss. The boss sent him on a work errand and then drove my mom and us kids to the bus station. We took a 2 hour bus ride and my uncle picked us up and took us to my grandparents‚Äô house. We stayed there for a while but eventually The Asshole showed up and promised it wouldn‚Äôt happen again and we went back. Of course it did happen again but my mom never tried to leave again. he would lash out at my siblings and me nearly every day. There were times I would come home and she would be yelling at my brother or my sister over nothing. I could hear her from the front yard and I would just leave and go hang out with a friend or just go see a movie or something.  many failed relationships, one day I met a girl who also had a rough childhood and we instantly connected. I felt like I had found the female version of me. Thus began phase 2.  2.**  had been interested in going to a technical school to learn programming. I was always a bit of a computer geek. I applied at a local school and was told that I would need some financial documents from my parents for financial aid. When I asked my parents they refused. ome B from The Asshole about not wanting the school to see their tax documents because they didn‚Äôt want to get caught cheating on their taxes. I honestly think he just didn‚Äôt want me to succeed because he was such a failure. I found out from the school that if I wasn‚Äôt living at home that I could apply for aid without them. I would have to wait because I was only 18. I found out another alternative was to be emancipated or to be married. I loved this girl I was with anyway so we got married. hortly after she told me she was pregnant with my sone and I was thrilled a few years later we had a daughter. I would finally have a decent family because as long as I took care of them and loved them they would love me, right‚Ä¶ right?  graduated from school and things were going ok. I got a good job with a company based in New York. The pay was better than anything I would ever get in my local city. My city has a one of the lowest cost of living of the entire country but my wages were like if I was living in New York which has one of the highest. Things were looking up. Then the layoffs started. I worked with about 20 other IT people. Every year, usually in November there would be layoffs and we would always look one, sometimes two people. We had a great severance package so even though it seemed inevitable that I would be laid off I stayed because there was a safety net.  course the constant threat of layoffs made the work environment very tense. There was lots of back stabbing and sucking up to the boss. I did all kinds of things to try to ensure that I would make it as long as possible. I would set people up to fail so they would be laid off first. I would convince my coworkers to look for other jobs even if I felt the opportunities weren‚Äôt great. I would play both sides in arguments and pit people against each other. It was horrible and I felt horrible for doing it but I did it to keep my great paying job so I could make life better for my family. Because of this toxic work environment I would come home totally exhausted and depressed. We did things with the kids but I was always a bit down and I‚Äôm sure that negatively affected them. We didn‚Äôt take many family vacations and I always drove old crappy cars because I was afraid to have a car payment because I could lose my job at any time. Eventually everyone was gone but me and another company bought my company. The new company was great and I could finally be happy right‚Ä¶ right?  3.**  2 and 3 actually kinda overlapped a bit. While my work situation was still hectic my daughter (13 at the time) started to have some behavioral problems. Once day while I was at work, I got a call from my son and he told me my daughter didn‚Äôt come home from school. I called my wife and we both rushed home. I got on the phone with the school and they told me that she had a letter that said she could go home with a friend from school. We hadn‚Äôt written a letter. Apparently she stole $20 from my son and decided to run away with a boy from school. The police found them pigging out on about $20 worth of junk food in the woods near his house. When the cops left I had a stern talk to her. A few times she tried to walk past me to get to her room and I blocked her and forced her to sit on the couch and listen. We weren‚Äôt the type of parents to spank our kids and probably only gave them a little smack a total of 2 or 3 times between them both. short while later she would fail to come home from school again. This time the school informed me that she was still at school and we would need to come get her. When we got there two police officers met us at the front door and told me that I was going to listen to what the lady inside said and keep my fucking mouth shut or I was going to jail. I had no idea what was going on. The lady inside informed me that my daughter told them that she had been abused at home. I told the lady I had no idea what she was talking about. My wife started freaking out and my son who was sitting at the table with us started crying. They asked if they could interview my son and we and he agreed. I‚Äôm glad he did because apparently he convinced them that my daughter had made it all up. We took her home and family life was tense from that moment on. My wife and son both grew distant with my daughter. During this ordeal the lady also said my daughter told her that I went on motorcycle trips all the time and left her at home. I did get a motorcycle to try to relieve the stress I was under at work and I did go on day trips about once a month. I never went on another ride. The only time I rode my motorcycle after that was to work.  have to admit it was hard for me to be close with her after that. I eventually forgave her but my wife and son still were distant with her. I tried everything I could to make my family happy again but it never really worked. Any time my daughter didn‚Äôt get her way she would lash out at me. Most of her outbursts would start when I sighed during moments of frustration with her. It got to a point where I was afraid to speak in my own home for fear that she would start and argument and tell the school or the police that I was hitting her.  when she was 16 she met a guy. I would later find out he was 24. This guy was a scumbag. Not long after she met him she started an argument with me. he was cussing and yelling at me and I told her that if she couldn‚Äôt calm down and speak to me like a rational person and stop yelling and disrespecting me she could get out of my house. I didn‚Äôt want her to go but she had pushed me to my limit. The argument had started because we asked her to go to a family trivia night. My wife, at my request, had started trying to find things for the family to do for fun. he didn‚Äôt want to go but I talked her into it. The argument started when we got back home and I said, ‚Äúthat was pretty fun wasn‚Äôt it‚Äù. he said, ‚Äúif fucking sucked‚Äù and I sighed. That sigh set her off.  next day she moved out. he stayed with the scumbag and his dad and three siblings for a few months but eventually they had an argument and she came back. he stayed until a few months before graduation and then one night we had a little argument and she barged off to her room. The next morning she was crying and slamming things around in her room. When I asked what was wrong she said she missed the bus. I told her I would take her to school and she calmed down a bit. I rushed to get a shower and when I came back to her room she said not to worry about it because she was going to get a ride with her friend since it was such a hassle. Apparently my rushing to get ready made her think I was mad and didn‚Äôt want to take her. That was the exact opposite. I wanted to take her because it would give us a chance to make amends over the argument the night before. I told her that and she called me a liar and slammed the door in my face. I wasn‚Äôt wearing shoes and the door went over my foot and my foot was stuck under the door. I had to tear the door off the hinges to free my foot. he thought I did it out of anger and called me a psycho. When she got home that evening she packed and moved back in with the scumbag.  didn‚Äôt talk to her again until the night of her graduation. I tried but she wouldn‚Äôt take my calls. The school called me and said she would not be able to attend her graduation if she didn‚Äôt show up for the rehearsals and she wasn‚Äôt there. I called the scumbag and told him. He said he couldn‚Äôt take her because he was at work but he would call her and see if she would allow me to take her because she really wanted to go and be with her friends. he agreed and I picked her up and took her. We also took her to her graduation and it seemed like things were getting better. summer we took a family trip to the beach and late the first night she got mad because I was talking to everyone else and she didn‚Äôt think I was talking to her enough. he barged out and her boyfriend went and got her. Then he came into the living room of the condo we had rented and started blaming me for all of her problems. He blamed me for all sorts of things. My son left the condo and later his girlfriend said he had to leave before he got upset and hit the scumbag. He didn‚Äôt bother to defend me. He just left. My daughter and the scumbag left went home the next morning and we followed the day after.  they had a big argument and she left him and come back home. Not long after she met another guy and moved out. This guy was great. I loved him like one of my own children. My daughter‚Äôs behavior started to improve and I‚Äôm sure it was because she was with this new guy. Things were great for about 2 years. he and her new guy would come over at least once every two weeks for dinner and we all got along well. I was finally happy for the most part.  son moved in with his girlfriend and I was a bit sad for a while because from the day my mom dumped my siblings with me and my grandparents I had always been a caretaker in one way or another, either as a big brother watching over my brother and sister or as a dad. For the first time since I was twelve I was just me. I didn‚Äôt know how to be just me. I had no purpose. Other than that though things were ok and finally I was going to be alright‚Ä¶ right? had a beach vacation planned and about a week before, my son told me that he and his girlfriend couldn‚Äôt go. He wouldn‚Äôt tell me why. I thought it was because they didn‚Äôt want a repeat of the drama during the last trip. I assured him that my daughter had improved and that wasn‚Äôt likely to happen again. He said that wasn‚Äôt it and they would go next time. I asked if it was about the money they would need to spend. I offered to pay for everything including his gas to get there. He said that wasn‚Äôt it and he couldn‚Äôt tell me why but he would tell me later. we found out there was going to be a hurricane off the coast during our vacation. I texted my daughter but she didn‚Äôt respond. For three days I got no response to any or my texts or calls. I wanted to let them know that they probably shouldn‚Äôt go because of the hurricane. We were still going to go because we couldn‚Äôt get a refund on the reservations. The night before the trip I called three times and she finally answered. he said she was suffering from anxiety and it was all my fault and that I was the last person she wanted to speak to. he started blaming me for everything from her failed friendships, to not having a drivers license or a decent job. Then she hung up. I had no idea what was going on. Things had been going so well.  wife and I went and I tried to have a good time. It rained most of the time that we were there and we just watched the storm from the balcony of the condo and braved the winds and rain to go out and eat seafood. Then on the day before the end of the trip the weather cleared. We went for a walk on the beach and I was surrounded by families. Every time I saw a dad playing with his kids I got choked up. ome little girl that resembled my daughter ran up past me yelling, ‚Äúdaddy, daddy!‚Äù and I fucking lost it. I told my wife I wanted to go home and we packed and check out early.  tried several times to get my daughter to talk to me but she wouldn‚Äôt. Then my son got upset with me. We had a YouTube channel we worked on together and he stopped contributing. I thought he was just being lazy and tried to come up with a schedule we could stick to. He said it was too structured. I said we could just doing it when he wanted to and he said that he didn‚Äôt want it to be left up to him. He said we could work on it once a month and I agreed. I said I would call him on unday on the weeks we were going to work on it so we could decide what day. He said he wouldn‚Äôt know which days until the day we do it because he‚Äôs depressed a lot. I got frustrated and tried to explain that, that wasn‚Äôt fair to me because I have bad days too. He told me that I was toxic since I didn‚Äôt understand his problems and got mad at me. I said that expecting me to drop everything I was doing when he happens to have a good day wasn‚Äôt fair and maybe we just needed to quit if it wasn‚Äôt important enough to work on it when he has a bad day and he agreed.  a few days later my daughter called me. he told me the reason she didn‚Äôt go to the beach and the reason she hadn‚Äôt talked to me in two months was because she went to my son‚Äôs place and she and my son‚Äôs girlfriend were talking. Apparently at some point when my son was being lazy, and I guess my daughter has upset me, I told him to get off his lazy ass and do what needed to be done because I didn‚Äôt raise two shitty kids. I don‚Äôt remember saying this. If I did it must have been because she had upset me because for the last two years I thought things were going great. We were getting along. I liked her boyfriend. he had a decent job and we had even recently gone to lunch and spent a pleasant day together. I was really proud of how much she had grown in the last two years. At any rate it was just a stupid comment in a moment of frustration.  this point I‚Äôm furious with my son‚Äôs girlfriend and my son. I don‚Äôt understand why she would have said that to my daughter. he knew how much trouble we have had in the past and she seemed to always be sympathetic. he had to have known this would be the outcome. ince my son has moved in with her she has pushed away all of his friends and I think this was just an attempt to push my wife and I away too. This upset my daughter so much she started having panic attacks and had to quit her job and she refuses to speak to me.  have never felt this bad and hopeless. I‚Äôm working from home because of covid and I spend all day, every day, alone. I have no friends. I still rarely speak with my mother. My siblings both hate me because I don‚Äôt speak to my mom even though they know what she did to me. The only person I have is my wife. My wife rarely actually talks to me. he‚Äôll let me sit and talk as long as I want but she never really has conversations with me. I feel like most of the time she just tolerates me. he‚Äôs all I seem to have now and I ofter wonder if she‚Äôll eventually get tired of tolerating me too. I don‚Äôt blame her. I‚Äôve been depressed for one reason or another since before she met me. I feel like I was broken at the age of 12 and never really had a chance at being happy. The only reason I haven‚Äôt ended it is because on the off chance that my family cares about me I wouldn‚Äôt want to hurt them.

depression,"Hi all. For about 2 years now I have been suffering from pretty bad anxiety and depression. I used to have panic attacks and the like but I have been able to control them before I spiral. Right now I am a sophomore in college. I transferred last year because of depression that I originally stated was due to the claustrophobia (it had about 2000 students). I now attend a great school but it is far from home. I have been to about 3 counselors and never really was able to make much headway, perhaps it was my fault for not opening up so much im not sure. Anyways, my depression is creeping back into my life and it is starting to get really bad. I haven't selected a major because I just don't like anything. My grades are also pretty bad as of right now too. What should I do now? I don't know if possibly taking time off would be smart because I don't know what I would do and I'm scared my dad and siblings and relatives will judge me. ame goes for transferring for a second time.

depression,"This is something I‚Äôve wanted to talk about for a long time but didn‚Äôt quite know how to phrase‚Ä¶ and I still don‚Äôt. I‚Äôll start by prefacing that I‚Äôm not anti- marijuana and I have smoked many, many time before. Before it was legal I would buy from dealers or get it from friends. I never had an awful time while I was high but didn‚Äôt love it either. I didn‚Äôt smoke everyday but probably a few times a month. When I got to college, it became legal. Therefore, I started smoking legal, government weed. Now those highs were scary. I would feel like I was dying, I would have panic attacks and dissociate from my body. But I kept doing it because sometimes it was ok and hell, everyone else was doing it. In my second year of college, the pandemic started. To destress, me and some of my friends smoked some government controlled weed from a dispensary. We started playing monopoly and then, I lost it. I looked in the mirror and I didn‚Äôt know who I am. I was convinced I would be high forever. Nothing felt real. I grabbed a friend and she helped calm me down until the high wore off. A few days later I went to a restaurant with some friends. I was sober but something felt off. Nothing seemed real. I was too in tune with the music and peoples conversations. My friends seemed like actors, like I didn‚Äôt really know them. I went to the bathroom and cried. I was silent for the rest of the night. I had no idea what happened. After that I was fine for a while. The pandemic sent us all back to our hometowns and I was happy to see my boyfriend again. He lived 30 mins away from me in the next town over. I would often drive the highway there and had no problem with it before. But the same thing happened on the highway that happened in the restaurant. But worse. I was driving and everything looked fake. The clouds looked like paintings and ever field looked like the one before. I did not recognize where I was, even though I had been there many times before. Then I had my first real panic attack. My chest started to hurt and all my limbs went numb. I felt like I couldn‚Äôt breathe and I was sweating up a storm. I pulled over and start crying. People drove by looking at me like I was crazy. And I sure as hell felt it. I had no idea what had happened and thought I was going insane. I told no one. I feared they would put me in a hospital. But it kept happening. Eventually I had no choice but to tell my parents. I went to a doctor and he gave me some anti anxiety medicine. They made me feel even worse, like I was constantly in a dream. I got off those meds pretty quick and started therapy. My therapist used the word ‚Äúderealization.‚Äù I had never heard it before but it felt nice to know that others had experienced what I did. I started having these ‚Äúepisodes‚Äù as I call them, everywhere. At work, out and about, even in my own house. No where felt safe. I had to quit my job, I mostly stopped driving, and I stopped doing the things I love. I saw more therapists and more doctors and was given more meds. Eventually I found a medicine that seemed to mostly work. I still have episodes every once in a while, but that‚Äôs just counting the big ones. Pretty much every time I leave the house or sometimes even just my room it takes me around an hour to adjust to my surroundings before the brain fog lifts. And sometimes it doesn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs never been as bad as the time on the highway, but I mostly never feel real. I feel pain and I feel emotion but my head gets heavy and I start to sweat and I fear that this place, this world is unsafe, that its not real and I‚Äôm not real and everything is nothing. I pray for an end to it all everyday. I think it would be better to be dead but I know deep down the my real fear is not being here, therefore making death not an option of escape. For now I just float. I float through life trying to ignore what‚Äôs in my head and the signals my body gives me when it thinks I‚Äôm in danger at the produce aisle of obeys. I dream of the girl I once was. I was carefree and stressed about small things like the boy from the bar not answering my napchat. Now I fear insanity. And I fear that might be the one real thing in my life. But I have no other option then to try new meds, new breathing techniques, name 5 things I can see and so on. I want to be happy, and I lot of times I am. But it‚Äôs so hard to be actually happy when you don‚Äôt even know what‚Äôs real.I am not a doctor, and I will never be a doctor. But after doing my own research I think marijuana is the one to blame. Those highs took me to a new dimension, straight out of a horror movie. I believe that to be my trauma. Now I see my friends smoking daily without an issue and wonder how long before the episodes hit them too, that is if ever. I wonder why no one talks about this side effect? I‚Äôve seen hundreds on social media share the same story but no government advertising share this risk. And I know this is not a risk for everyone, but how about the hundreds it is? Weed should be legal, but not like this.I believe it ruined my life and I would not wish this experience on my worst enemy.But for now, I float.My short story about depression, anxiety, and derealization",1635222685,5179,1017

depression,"I'm 23 and I just went through the most horrible break up ever. I've been abused my whole life and the residual trauma had a huge impact on me. I was insecure and my ex left me for it. I had moved to a different state away from everyone we knew and it was so hard going through it alone. After a month he threatened to kick me to the streets so I was forced to move in with my abusive family. This house is a total dump because my mom is a hoarder. There is filth everywhere, no lights, and no working kitchen so I'm hungry all the time. I'm so miserable in so many ways and I don't really have any friends to be there. One of the few people I trusted basically tried to use me for sex when he knew I was going through so much, it was so insensitive. I don't feel trusting of this person anymore and my whole view has changed, I'm mad at how people treat me..but I still keep going around him because I'm so desperate for company and an ""escape"" from the current hell I'm living in. I feel so trapped, I'm poor, I'm miserable and I don't have anyone to be there for me. I've never felt so low in my life, I feel like I've truly hit rock bottom.

depression,"  Relaxation Techniques For Coping With ocial Anxiety you are suffering from social anxiety, then you must know how awful it feels when you are feeling anxious. Not only does your mind race and you feel insecure and awful inside, but you also have physical symptoms outside. Everyone can see you as you sweat for no reason, shake uncontrollably, and blush at the worst possible moment. this article, I'm going to show you how you can cope with these physical symptoms so people can't see you are feeling anxious. You'll be able to get some control over your physical symptoms of social anxiety. And since you will no longer have to worry about how you look to others, your actual anxiety will also go down significantly. The technique I'm going to teach you has to do with relaxation. Relaxation is the opposite of anxiety. By consciously choosing to make yourself more relaxed, you will be able to control your anxiety. does the technique work? There are two parts to it. The first part is learning how to become more relaxed by yourself in the comfort of your own home. The second part is using the technique in real life to help you become more relaxed when you most need it. Believe me, the relaxation technique I'm about to show you is a godsend when it comes time to face a social situation you are most afraid of. the first part of the technique is to sit or lay down somewhere where you are comfortable. It is best if you are by yourself so you feel as little anxiety as possible. Now go through your body and relax every part of it. tart at your head and move your way down to your feet, relaxing each muscle group as you pass it. First, relax your forehead, let your jaw go loose, drop your shoulders. The idea is to let go of as much tension as you possibly can. If it helps, you can also try imagining a relaxing beach or stream in your head. Then just lay there for a few minutes and try to get the feel of how it feels like to be totally relaxed. second part is to then take this relaxed feeling into your daily life. Throughout the day, remember to relax your muscle groups individually. Go as relaxed and limp as you can get. The more relaxed you can make your body become, the more your anxiety will begin to go away. step one is to practice becoming relaxed inside your home. Many socially anxious people are so tensed up all the time they do not really know how relaxation feels like. The second step is to become more relaxed as you are around people. The best time to use this technique is when you are feeling especially anxious. you want to learn more sure-fire techniques about [coping with social anxiety,]( then click to check out for more tips on [overcoming social anxiety]( here](Relaxation Techniques For Coping With Social Anxiety",1635220834,2761,503

depression,"  might be just me alone feeling this way, but I felt the need to share and ask for advice. I'm a musician. I released my first EP last Feb and I'm very proud of it. I make electronic music and have been at it since 2012, but this was the first time I felt it necessary to release something I felt was worthy of other people listening to. I'm very critical of myself. Feb of this year, I was hit very hard with some health issues and mental health issues. On top of this past 2020-2021 being rough worldwide, it was very rough for me emotionally and physically. Music has always gotten me through it all. 2020 ummer, I hit a rut where I started listening to a lot of ambient rain sounds and all that at work when I worked from home. It was relaxing and kept the stress away. I found that I was always listening to that instead of music which became a problem for me and that was when I first felt this issue. Then when my health issues hit in Feb this year after releasing my EP, the same thing came back again. I found myself not listening to music as often anymore. When I did, I felt a physical fear. Now months have passed and I feel in the same rut. I started taking medication for my depression, and my health is under control now, however I have this overwhelming fear that I don't feel anything from music anymore, but I know thats not true. spent a lot of time analyzing this and I feel as if most of it comes from shame from me not working on music. I'm afraid to listen because it brings all these heavy emotions and nostalgia that make me want to make music, but when I'm not making it its too much to handle. I've been listening to music more and more and it seems like it's getting easier. just have this overwhelming fear that I don't love music which isn't possible due to how it's been all I've had to live for my entire life. I can still turn on songs and instantly feel that nostalgia and strong emotions, but its just sometimes feels like too much to handle. Listening to some of these old songs just brings such strong emotions sometimes and I have a hard time finding things that don't. When I listen to music and I realize how I'm not working as hard as it as I should, thats what I feel has pushed me away from it. Part of me was afraid that my antidepressants did this too me, but then I realized this feeling hit before I started taking them. may just be rambling here, but I just wanted to throw this out there and see if anyone has felt similar to me.Afraid of listening to music and affecting me as an artist due to depression",1635218600,2555,494

I miss when I would walk the dogs I was boarding at night alone down the dimly lit city streets, just letting the music surround me inside my earbuds and flow through me.

It's just it's getting hard, We can't talk about certain things that we've talked about for example music whenever whenever someone has an opinion that goes against his he completely shuts down and doesn't even consider what I have to say about the matter even when it's serious,  And he has a lot of bipolar mood swings in because the lot of shit we plan ends up getting canceled. Believe me I have tried my best to be there for him since day one I found out but I don't know what to do anymore because it's just getting worse it works and it's getting to the point where it's really burdening me as well, I've tried talking to him about this,  And never ends cause even when we do talk about it it just the topic gets averted somehow.  I have tried not done so much for him and I really do sympathize with him but it seems like I'm just getting shit on, and he claims to care about me meanwhile he refuses to keep me in the loop, and whenever i say something that goes against his opinions, I'm the bad guy. I don't get it, Didn't know where else to go to ask.My friend has severe depression and I dont know what to do",1635216863,1316,259
depression,"For as long as I can remember, I've felt nothing but sadness and emptiness, and because of it, I cannot make friendships that last very long, because people think I'm too much to deal with, or I push them away, and then I find out I suffer from a condition called ""Quiet BPD"" and then it made it realize it's not all entirely my fault, I thought I was just having a rough time in life because I was doing everything wrong. o now I'm trying to get past everything, but it's so hard, and especially knowing it's an ever long battle I have to keep fighting everyday for as long as my existence, I'm so lonely, and it sucks and it makes it feel like life isn't even worth living sometimes, I'm just so miserable and I want to get better but I feel my depression just sucks all my hope and happiness away. people from Reddit, this is my first post, and I thank you for any who took the time to read it, I just wanted to get my thoughts out there.I'm sick of feeling this way",1635216834,969,190
depression,"My therapist told me she didn't have a magic wand to fix me. I don't expect her too but can someone at least tell me wtf is wrong and where to start? I feel like I just get talked into circles with people. I don't feel like I'm getting help anywhere I turn. They started me on meds in eptember that made things so much worse. Normally I can at least control my crying in front of others. But the meds had me not sleeping and crying 24/7. I had chest pains and my speech would slur.  I gave it a month an it just continued to get worse.  When I reached out to ask if it was normal the nurse told me just to stop taking them and come in November.  I feel like I messed up asking for help. I feel like I'm never going to be worth helping. It is just a game to everyone to see when I'll die.  so tired of just living. There is nothing that bring me joy, I just sit and watch the clock or wait to clock in or out at work. I'm supposed to be charting my moods to take to my psychiatrist but idk even what to put. What defines a good day? What defines a bad day? He wants me to use an app Dailyo or something. I bought it an im charting it but I don't think I'm doing it right. I keep putting good because idk what defines a good day or bad day. To me everyday is the same. Everyday I live this useless piece of shit life. Everyday I'm human garbage that I wake up. Everyday I'm forced to live this worthless life of mine. I'm ruined an I just want it all to end. I'm so tired of everyone playing with my head like it is a game.

depression," I feel like my entire life has been an absolute catastrophe for those around me and I've tried my best to contain it to myself but I'm starting to implode. Everything was going relatively well until I moved away from my friends early in childhood, around the age of 11, and since then I have not been able to fit in at all with any group of people. I'm heading off to college with absolutely nothing I value about myself other than some academic achievements. I haven't hung out with a friend for an entire day for more than at least 4 years, and I've sat at home keeping all this to myself. I've tried making advances towards those I know for some sort of engagement, but never received any sort of invite. The last time I had anyone come to an event regarding me like a graduation party or birthday party was at least 10 years ago. Hope is truly starting to be lost. I'm not suicidal in anyway, it's just extremely difficult keeping up with all this. I've started to workout and better myself, which did feel good for a little while, but after like 1 year of doing so, still nothing changed about those and people around me. I have no idea what to do. The isolation has caused lots of anxiety in public which was absent previously, and again, I'm just really confused. Am I ugly? Am I just really weird to talk to? Do I look mean? Do I come across a certain way? I have no idea.I've been waiting for my life to get better, but even action isn't helping.",1635216255,1456,276

depression,"I broke up with someone I met online, we were both madly in love with each other. This person was like no other in the world, we were perfect for each other. I‚Äôve never been cared for or loved like that before, and i‚Äôve never care about someone like that before. I made us part ways before meeting because I knew we wouldn‚Äôt just go out for dates. If we had sex he would‚Äôve seen my body.  used to be morbidly obese, I‚Äôve lost the weight but my body‚Äôs ruined because of it. Not only that, but the way my body looks regardless, its naturally extremely ugly. No exaggeration, it really does look extremely ugly, I would describe it but I literally don‚Äôt even know where to begin.  definitely would have put him off.  so digusted by the appearance of my body that I never even look in the mirror, let alone let anyone else see me naked, it makes me feel sick, and would make anyone else feel sick, if I were someone else, even I wouldn‚Äôt have had sex with me, thats how bad it looks.  deserves better. He deserves beautiful, and i know thats what every guy needs. I didn‚Äôt want to be selfish and hold him back in this regards, so I made us part ways before we met in person. I made us break up without a proper explanation.  level of mental and emotional pain I feel right now is extremely unbearable. I‚Äôve never felt so unstable before in my life.

Well, I‚Äôm 15 years old and currently a sophomore in high school. Right now, my grades aren‚Äôt so hot. I have 3 B‚Äôs. And before you say ‚ÄúHey that‚Äôs not a bad grade!‚Äù Please save it. My parents are both middle eastern immigrants who were at the top of their class in prestigious schools. To them a B is awful. Before this year I was an A+ student. I was much more focused on my study (albeit it was a little easier since everything was on zoom), but now I‚Äôm falling apart. Not just grade-wise either. My friend group has basically split. I still have 4 close friends who I love and talk to regularly, but the other half of my friend group has basically split from us. They all just do their own thing now, and I barely see them save like 2 whom I have classes with. Other than that, I just talk to my 4 friends everyday. I used to be much more social, much more likeable. Now I‚Äôm kinda awkward and much more quiet. I also feel very sad all the time. Well, maybe sad isn‚Äôt the right word. Hopeless. I feel like I‚Äôm going nowhere in life. A think something that could really sum up what I‚Äôm feeling right now is the lyric ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not living, I‚Äôm just killing time‚Äù from Radiohead. I don‚Äôt feel alive. I have no passions or ambitions. I have nothing that I wake up and look forward to. I do the same things everyday, and I don‚Äôt even enjoy the things I used to. I used to love music and constantly seek out new music, now I just have the same 2 artists on repeat at all times. I used to love playing video games, now I barely touch my computer except maybe twice a week. I just really need advice right now. I have no clue what to do. My grades are slipping and I don‚Äôt feel happy anymore. What should I do? And please, say something besides ‚ÄúJust get a hobby bro‚Äù. Believe me, ive tried.

depression,"I 28m think I‚Äôm heading into a serious depression that I know I‚Äôll have trouble pulling myself out of. I‚Äôll share some background info with you all so my previous statement makes sense.  used to suffer with very severe anxiety and OCD for most of my life, as far back as I can remember to be honest. It took me until my early to mid 20s to conquer my anxiety and ocd through practiced therapies I‚Äôve learned from reading books on my mental health struggles. Things were great for years until about 8 months ago.  girlfriend of 9 years fell ill with a chronic condition we are still trying to pinpoint a root cause for to this very day. Currently nowhere closer to finding a treatment or solution then when this all started.  months ago I went through the grueling process of getting into a dream career only to not be accepted, this was going to solidify my future and lead to a comfortable life after my apprenticeship was over.  months ago my dog, who‚Äôs like my son and the most important thing in our lives was diagnosed with lymphoma at 5 years old. He‚Äôs my everything and even though we are fortunate enough to have pet insurance to cover the chemo this whole process has been heartbreaking.  top of those 3 huge issues, I own and operate a business with my girlfriend (she started it but is now unable to work consistently due to her health condition) so I‚Äôve been doing the job of 2 people for the past 8 months by myself along with taking my dog to his chemo treatments, running errands, and keeping my girlfriend comfortable (as well as helping her with her depression due to her situation), and just trying to hold myself together while forcing a smile on my face so no one around me finds out about how I‚Äôve been feeling.  hiding it, my girlfriend stuck through my journey of becoming ocd and anxiety free but it wasn‚Äôt easy for her and it definitely put a strain on our relationship during that time. I don‚Äôt want her to see me at a low point again, even though it‚Äôs for a different issue. I forgot what happiness feels like. I mean, how can someone maintain any form of happiness in my situation? I can‚Äôt share how I feel, I swallow the sadness and the pain every morning, I can‚Äôt sleep, I don‚Äôt eat right, I don‚Äôt have friends anymore and my hobbies have been on the back burner for months to the point that I‚Äôve lost complete interest in them.  wake up with aches in the morning, whether it‚Äôs my back, my feet, neck, arms, you name it, it aches. It‚Äôs kicking up my anxiety as well. I feel like I‚Äôm going to pass out or throw up when I‚Äôm in large crowded spaces, or if listening to multiple people trying to talk to me. Even when I‚Äôm on the highway driving, if I‚Äôm surrounded by traffic I get a panicky feeling and I grip the steering wheel so hard that my hand cramps. I hide this too when I‚Äôm with family or my girlfriend in the car.  becoming a shell of who I used to be when things were good. I‚Äôm not giving up on my girlfriend or my dog. They are my number one priority but I feel like I‚Äôm losing myself too. I need to keep it together for the 3 of us but it‚Äôs becoming difficult. I‚Äôve wept more in the last few months than I ever have during my life. I feel so alone and I‚Äôm afraid things will never go back to normal.  apologies for the long and unstructured wall a babble.

(A trigger warning) after i was raped in the woods (i was a virgin) i lost my minds eye. there is nothing but darkness inside. i also cannot hear other voices or music or sounds in my imagination. songs that i love replay in my head only in my voice. but ever since i got drugged with an enormous amount of acid last year, i feel like there are multiple different versions of me inside me and they argue and conversate and calm each other. sometimes two will be speaking and all of a sudden i jump in like ""wait what are you guys talking about?"" then i recognize i did that and i become a broken record thinking over and over in my head how i need to tell someone what just happened. thinking back over the years i notice that my behavior was inconsistent. i wonder if i've always had DID but after the acid (which sent me into a 4 month psychosis) maybe i became aware of what i couldn't hear before, like, they were latent but still affecting my life without me being aware. my depression is so bad i cant clean for weeks then ill spend 8 hours cleaning and buy stuff for my room. i have entirely rearranged my room 10 times in the last 3 months because i keep telling myself ""if i put this here and do that i will finally be able to do this (i.e practice piano/guitar, do yoga, learn a new language etc.) then i do it one night and boom im back down again in bed all day. i barely eat, i barely drink water, i feel like i am not capable of doing anything. i met this guy even though i don't want a relationship due to an extreme recent heartbreak, i dont want to have sex or even be around people like that on a personal level, but one night i was wearing a wig and went out to a bar to dance alone and i gave him my number. i didnt even like him really but his friends were making fun of him trying to talk to me so i wanted to make this stranger look good! next thing i know two weeks later im letting him have sex with me. i immediately regret it during it. day after i think hes adorable and i want to cuddle. then everything about him annoys me, then i still want to see him. one minute im telling myself ""we wont do this again"" then i feel completely different. it doesnt feel like im just confused, it feels %100 percent real, whatever im thinking. i hate eating meat , i want to be vegan, then im eating meat! the only true consistent thing on my mind is how much i want to make music, and how im too stupid to learn anything new. im 28, i love myself but i hate my life and these thoughts that dominate me so much i cant even shower for 5 days. i want to die but i wont kill myself because i have hope, idk why i have hope because my life has been terrible since i was small and its only gotten worse. a lot of people think im attractive so they assume ive lived a great life but really im thinking about suicide every single day and i live with severe body dysmorphia and every person ive gotten involved with were narcs or manipulative or jealous of me and were pretending to be my friend for their own personal gain. im extroverted at work and in crowds but in all honesty an introvert. i use to get screamed at growing up for being quiet so i started being an extrovert as a defense mechanism. i am tired of having a personality that was built around abuse i just want to be how i authentically feel but when i try to show my real truest self (quiet) i get asked over &amp; over ""are you ok you're not yourself"" by people who don't know me!! people who have only been around me for a few hours and few weeks. before i could brush it off now it infuriates me to no end. every time i try to seek therapy i immediately face a road block then i give up. fml.Who am I now?",1635213635,3767,749
depression,"Hello everyone, this is my first post ever so bear with me. I couldn‚Äôt figure out where to put this, but this is close enough to what  assuming the issue is. I am 19F, and my childhood was interesting to say the least. Just traumatic enough to leave emotional scars, but nothing too drastic. I‚Äôve had a history of depression and general anxiety stemming from childhood emotional abuse, and after 2 years of getting out of the situation I thought I was doing better. Not really.

I‚Äôm currently a college student, and everything is fine in that aspect, but all I want to do is self destruct, fall into toxicity and rot. Reality also doesn‚Äôt feel real, and that‚Äôs something else entirely. This doesn‚Äôt feel like how my depression in the past has felt, so I‚Äôm just confused but at the same time overtly self aware. Can anyone else relate to this?

depression,"I'll try to be as brief as I can and explain my situation, if I miss something, then I'm sorry.  been struggling with anxiety since I was around 10-12. I remember I was paralyzed around people, even if they were nice to me. I didn't know why. When I tried to play or talk with someone, I could force myself to do it, I even felt the need to connect with others, but when I was around someone(even someone I liked), I literally felt no positive feelings. I had some alright days, I liked to read and listen to music, but things get horrifyingly worse. Most of days I didn't feel anything apart from emptiness and pain. I progressively started to get worse to the point, when I finally when I was 14-16, I could feel no joy or any positive thing in my life anymore. Books, games, family, other people, no matter if outside or inside, no matter where I was I just felt emptiness, void in my mind. Nothing mattered to me, I lacked purpose, nothing brought me comfort or even a smile. I didn't no why. I tried to do stuff, imitate my peers, do what other people do, but to no avail went to psychiatrist with my parents when I was 16, she prescribed my clonazepam for anxiety and prozac for depression. Clonazepam finally brought me some peace - shallow feeling, but at least I didn't feel stress after taking that, but after some time I got addicted and **I've been taking clonazepam everyday for last 13 years. It stopped working couple of years ago, I tried to quit about 50 times, but couldn't do it.** went to around 15-20 psychiatrists and to around same number of psychologists in my life trying more than 15 meds for past 15 years: (Celexa) (Lexapro) (Prozac) (Paxil) (Zoloft) many more, I can give you the full list if you like, but I tried all categories of antidepressants for at least 3-4 months. RIs, NRIs,Ms, ARIs, NRIs, TCAs, MAOIs - I tried them all and gave them a shot, I didn't give up, I spend most of my adult life trying to just be able to function on my own and I failed. I lowered my expectations, I didn't want happiness, I just wanted to live a life in which I could work, get out of my emotional hell. I did my best, worked different jobs, from banking industry to selling TVs for as long as I could, but everyday of my life was struggle, one medication after the other didn't work. course I went to psychologists, tried talk therapy, behavioral-cognitive therapy, psycho-dynamic therapy, psychoanalysis combined with meds, but I could make no progress. Went to endocrinologists, neurologists, I can say  had hundreds of medical consultations, but nobody found any trauma psychical or psychological trauma.** analyzed my life with psychologists, psychiatrists, hormones were all right, thyroid, testosterone, all aspect of my life, family, my thought process and **according to all doctors it seemed to be okay, nobody could find a reason or a way to improve my mental state, I've been still feeling horrible throughout all that wasted time.** life was mess ‚Äì I couldn‚Äôt develop my interests, I didn‚Äôt go to college, I struggled to work ‚Äì usually I had a job for couple of months and then quit, stayed at home with my parents and brother.  couldn't take it anymore, so after another antidepressant didn't work I said to myself: if nothings matters, then I can at least try to feel better for a while, so I took codeine(opioid similar to morphine, but less potent) and finally, for the first moment in my life I felt relief. Nothing crazy, I just felt okay in my bed, pain went away. **It was around 7 years ago.**  knew it was a bad decision, but imagine trying being so severely depressed for a year, being diligent, not giving up on therapy, trying the best specialists I could find trying to do everything I can to save my life and losing. I worked so hard to change my thinking, behavior, doing all the stuff my psychologists told me, doing their homework, working with psychiatrists as well and **no matter what I did, no matter what I changed, all I could achieve was disappointment, my mood and mental state stayed the same.**  I was fighting and losing all the time to the illness, then fought back again for another year, then two, three, five and still I was in the same horrifying place I couldn't escape, so I decided there's nothing more I can do, drugs was the only option in my mind to survive. make long story short in addition to my klonopin addiction, I developed opioid addiction to codeine, morphine, oxycodone etc., I took opioids on and off for months, then I tried to sober up, go back to therapy and take antidepressants, but after some time(from months to even a year of being sober), I could make no progress in my life, I still felt like I was in literal hell - I'm an atheist, but concept of hell perfectly describes, how it feels to be me. It feels like unfunny joke, I imagine myself as a isyphus repeating this cycle of addiction, sobriety, severe depression and everything all over again. 29 now, I'm at a point that I tried all most popular drugs: MDMA, LD, morphine, codeine, oxycodone, amphetamine, marijuana and many more to just hold onto something, anything. But drugs bring me no peace now, no indifferent or positive feelings, no matter if I'm sober or high I still feel about the same, so I don't know what to do. I don't want to go to another psychiatrists, to try the same RI for the 20th time and be disappointment, I have no feelings towards any people, I don't care about my family, I never cared since I developed my depression. I never had friends, I only hung out with people to see if I can do it, but I felt so tired and lacked energy to have any connection to people. Even when I had a girlfriend for 3 years and we were together I never felt love, care towards others, I don't know what is wrong with me. last thing that gave me hope was music, but know any music is annoying to me, it's just meaningless.  tried religion, meditation, I did so many mental operations to change my perspective, to feel some will to live, but no luck. don't think I'm special, I don't think I deserve happiness, I think I'm just unfortunate person, I don't blame fate or god, or my parents - I don't even blame myself. I just don't know what to do, because I'm to afraid to commit a suicide(I'm afraid I would survive and live even more hellish existence), so I'm not sure where to go now. I have no interests, I had some basic knowledge about art, but fragmented and not deep. I was interested in philosophy, in psychology, but for last years I didn't learn anything, I've read one book since 2016, I have no goals, nothing to live for. I can shut down my thinking by clonopin, so then I'm not stressed, yet I feel the void, inertia of my life in which nothing matters. This post doesn't matter, I'm convinced there is nothing anyone can say or do to help me, because I really tried. I tried seeing beautiful places like Rome, Paris, Canary Islands. I know how great champagne tastes like or michelin star restaurant, yet I never cared about anything. I don't know if it makes sense, hope it does. only thought that helps me get through a day is that life ends at some point and my mind will(at least I think so) disappear and I won't have to suffer more, but this day is in the distant future. I forgot something, feel free to ask, I'm open to any questions. Thank you for spending your time on my post, I know it's hectic, but it was exhausting to write this.15 years of depression. I tried everything to help myself. Nothing works. I feel there's no hope now.",1635208640,7518,1375

depression,"I‚Äôm 19 and I already hate life. My problem is that I am going to explode from the inside. I feel like im part of some sort of psychological experiment like the Russian leep Experiment or something. In high school, I was a quiet and non-social kid to everyone but my two only friends, but once I got to college, I wanted a fresh start. Im extremely social and I thought I made a freiend group but the ditched me despite my attempts to stay in it and my roommate even abandoned me and left to get in an absent room. Despite all of my attempts, I have not been able to make a single friend and have been alone in my room for nearly a month now. Therapists don‚Äôt help me and I can hear my window cactuses calling my name in childish tones like im some sort of mental patient. Big problem is that ,y heart is much larger than a usual person‚Äôs. My heart is so large that the love it creates desires to be let out any way possible, and I just want friends and most importantly somebody to love in order to give my heart what it wants. Right now it‚Äôs driven me so insane that I‚Äôve stacked my entire yard with at least 100 trees and 100s of flowers that anger my dad and that I protect with my life. I‚Äôve resorted to having plants as my children and since im away from them and have ran out of yard room my het is bursting and I feel like im going to explode. All that‚Äôs holding me over is the fact that im going to get a car on campus next semester so I can use apps to find friends or lovers. I‚Äôm not even bad looking. I‚Äôm literally only 189 lbs and 6 foot, which is average, i just don‚Äôt have a six pack so nobody likes me.  Loneliness is making my brain hurt all day long and my grades have been suffering because I‚Äôve been going to the gym over 3 times a day. I‚Äôm actually confident on the way I look but if exercising is my only way of getting others to recognize me  and possibly love me than screw the grades. I‚Äôve been near starving myself too, only eating some scrambled eggs for breakfast and two meatballs for dinner with no lunch. I can‚Äôt believe I haven‚Äôt lost weight or found a single friend. This loneliness is literally going to kill me. I feel the constant stress in my chest where my heart is. Almost everyone in my dorm has found friends or love by now but not me. Despite actually trying, I‚Äôm stuck alone here in my room, slowly becoming the embodiment of darkness and sorrow. I just want what others have. omebody to love, a  friend and a life. What do you all think? I don‚Äôt want to give up but at the same time I just want to end it all. Either that or the excessive love my heart emits is going to over stress and kill me. Right now the only things keeping me alive are several YouTube channels I like, HOPE, determination, the need to feel what it‚Äôs like to drive a Japanese sports car while playing eurobeat, and my parents.

depression,Over the course of the last year and a half my life has just been a downwards spiral to the point where I can finally admit I am depressed. I always viewed my depression as an excuse and a way of to get pity from others (which I don‚Äôt want). But I‚Äôm at the point where in the middle of my daily life I can find myself tearing up by just doing my everyday task. This is my 2nd year of college but I‚Äôm still a freshman since I haven‚Äôt even passed a semester‚Äôs worth of classes. I hate my major and just don‚Äôt have to motivation to put any effort into school. I honestly have no idea what I want to do with my life and the throughly that some people know from such a young is mind boggling to me. I have friends and a loving mother but I still feel that no one really would care if I‚Äôm gone besides my mom. I waste so much time taking naps because it‚Äôs truly the only thing I can enjoy and eases my stress. The only things I can manage to do are keep a part time job and occasionally go to the gym. I want to be a better person but I honestly don‚Äôt know how and I realize that I put forth no effort so I get no results. But above all else I realize I have a deep self hatred that has been grown over the course of my teenage life. I don‚Äôt know what to do and I just feel like everything is pointless. At this point it just feels like I‚Äôm waiting to die but I so separately want to enjoy life. for ranting of anyone is reading this.Never done anything like this before but I just want to vent,1635200800,1488,306

depression,"sorry if i wrote something wrong but english is not my language so i translated It from my native language. truth is that I don't even know where to start, but, whether I want to or not I have to start somewhere, so well.  I'm back to a point in my life where, I spend most of my time feeling bad, really bad and, I don't really know what's wrong with me. Well, I do know but somehow or other I don't want to believe that any of this is happening.  I don't think I was prepared for all this, let alone that it happened all at once, I have lost friendships, important people and even my pet, and, I have always known that nothing lasts forever, that all good things come to an end and blablabla but it hurts, it hurts in a way that it has never hurt before.  I wake up every morning not even knowing who I am, what I want or where I'm going, and, worst of all, is that for those questions until not long ago I was totally convinced of what their answers were but, now, all that clarity has turned into fear and uncertainty, because, whether I want to or not, I'm still in the same place where I was before, where I've always been. I cannot assimilate that everything I have and everything I am has changed so much in such a ridiculously small gap of time.  I try not to let the famous ""I can't"" take hold of me or my deepest self because, once it enters it is very complicated (and above all very exhausting) to let it out. I know that all this is nothing new for me and that fortunately (or unfortunately), I have had to feel infinitely worse than what I feel right now and that, without having very clear how, I got ahead and here I am.  I really try to continue being as strong as I have been so far because I know that when I stop being strong I will have no more reasons to keep breathing but, I also truly say that I FEEL that I can't go on, I don't have the strength to keep on fighting.  I feel that my existence right now does not make much sense, I feel that I am a ghost of the person I once was and that I fear from the bottom of my heart that this version of myself will not come back to the surface and that I will only be left with all the bad things I think I am.  I know perfectly well that sooner or later I will end up rising like a phoenix but, for now I am only able to writhe in my own ashes.  I hope to be strong enough to overcome all this, I really hope to get out of here, I don't want to end up becoming a ghost, not yet. know you will read this mom, and don't worry, ok?

depression,"ometimes, if I post about my depressive behaviors, or about problems with medications, I get a lot of comments that make assumptions, and then draw conclusions and offer ""advice"" from those assumptions.  I recently posted about a complication from my seroquel, and almost everyone that commented said that they assumed I either took too much, took it without a prescription, or took it for the wrong reason.  This is a place for advice and education where it's asked for, and in the capacity for which it is requested, yes, but I think we all (myself included) need to stop trying to educate people, consequently telling them that they're wrong, when they didn't ask for it.  When I made that post, I would have made note of it if I hadn't been prescribed the medication, if I had taken more than my prescribed dose, or if I had been taking it for the wrong reason.  I don't need to save face on reddit, I'm anonymous here, no reason to lie.  But the majority of the comments I received not only assumed I somehow took it wrong, but also assumed that I was none too intelligent and had no idea what I was doing, or didn't understand the drug I was dealing with.  Those are hurtful assumptions.  Not to scream too highly of myself, but I am of well-above-average intelligence, and I have a deep, thorough understanding of psychopharmacology,  because I studied psychology in college, and took classes on it.  I have also been on seroquel for years, and have always taken it at my recommended dose.  I simply had a strange experience with it that I'd never had before, it kind of freaked me out a bit, and I hopped on reddit to simply ask the community if anything like that had happened to anyone else before.  But I got a lot of backlash about taking medications without a prescription, taking too much of them, taking them when I don't know what they'll do to me, etc, when those things weren't at all a part of the equation. really need to stop making assumptions when we comment on others' posts.  We're not always the smartest or most informed on any given subject, as much as we like to think we are.  I, for one, am going to work on being kinder, more understanding, and less judgmental within the communities I belong to.Sometimes It Hurts",1635199959,2246,403
depression,"Does anyone else just sit there on their bed for hours on end, constantly telling yourself to do the thing you were going to do 3 hours ago. Even simple things like waking up in the morning is the hardest thing to do on a consisent basis and I just sit there and wonder how normal people are able to do it. While i'm sitting there scrolling through phone, laying there in bed, with the only thought in my mind on what's even the point of me continuing. For all I know this could all just be one big simulation we are all stuck in living a world where we blind ourselves on having free will when we actually don't. Points is I don't know how people can wake up on a daily basis, shower, brush, eat, and talk to other human beings on a day to day basis. And the worst part is idek if I have depression. I could just be deluding myself into thinking I have this illness for the sole purpose for having an excuse for living such a pitiful life. Which might be a little extreme since I'm only 17 years old but it kinda feels daunting that I have to go through my whole life with the intense amount of exhaustion it takes to even get out of bed. I prob shouldn't be complaining because my life hasn't gone off the deep end and despite all these feelings I am able to somewhat function and while I do have thoughts of suicide I've never acted upon them but it doesn't help I feel like I've accomplished nothing and might never accomplish anything and one day die just a pile of ash that was just as useless as a pile of ashWhy can't I get myself to do stuff",1635199899,1550,304

depression,"Hello, i am a 19 years old guy. Recently i have come to terms with reality. And that Is that i am dying alone. a very young age i was diagnosed with asthma. I have almost suffocated every other week. My parent's were constantly scared for my life up until the 10th year of my life. of my asthma i couldn't do much sports and i used to be fat because of it. I still to this day remember getting bullied in kindergarden And elementary school. around the time i was in elementary school i was diagnosed with adhd and a weak imunity system. I missed up to 250 hours of school a year. Because of all this i only had one friend at that time. puberty hit i started noticing something unusual, not only did i like girl's but one certain boy too. I surpressed this deep withing me until much later when i was around 16 years old when i fully admitted to myself that i was bisexual. forward few years and i am in middle school. Nothing has really changed but me getting into sports and actually losing weight. I still feel very lonely. pending weeks and months with just myself. It was at this time. Now that the loneliness has become crippling i start considering taking my own life. tanding on the edge of a roof good 30 meters above the ground, wishing i would jump. days later my friend Is missing a team member for a clash in League. ince i was the only League player he knew i agreed to join. Tldr. I fit into the group kinda well and started socialising. Until one day i met him. It was a short guy that i had start taking a liking to.  go forward and i like him more and more until i eventualy fall in love with him. For the 1st time i start to feel like i belong. That there Is someone that get's me. After 18 years of my life. One evening i decided to confess my feelings. After that je told me that je needs some time to consider his feelings, that he will let me know tommorow when we were hanging out with friends. evening he rejected me and then kissed me for good 30 seconds saying ""this doesn't mean anything"". When i confronted him what Is this all about, he told me he doesn't know how does je feel yet. Fast forward 9 months of giving me hope, and then giving me the cold shoulder je finally rejects me.  And telling me he was lying whenever he told me he might love me. broke me, i was all alone again. I started wondering what's wrong with me. Why did i deserve this, what did i do wrong. If even someone you do everything for, making sure they are happy, they are allright and that they have a pleasurable life. Is capable of stabbing you in the back like this. How little value i as a person must I have, I am worthless. I started considering suicide again, but i couldn't do it because i love him too much to make him go thru all the guilt. I don't want to cause him pain. being friend's with him Is nearly impossible for me to handle. He doesn't know how much am i suffering right now and he most likely never will.  i am considering distancing myself from all my friends and commiting suicide once they forget about me. But i still don't want to hurt my parent's. Right now i don't belong anywhere, i have no one to hug/kiss and will most likely never have. I am wasting all my time depressed staring at my wall and eating one meal worth a day wishing i got cancer from ciggaretes and dying.  Is misserable.I am dying alone after all.",1635199797,3350,648
depression,"I know that you guys probably see tons of these posts on here and are probably tired of it, but based on everyone‚Äôs personal experiences dealing with depressive disorders, am I depressed? I‚Äôm 19 and am currently a junior in college and I just feel shitty. You know? I just feel so exhausted all the time for no reason. I don‚Äôt sleep well anymore. I barely go to class and am basically failing half of them. I sleep pretty much at random intervals now and my memory is just absolutely atrocious. I can‚Äôt remember names or things I would literally say minutes before. It‚Äôs so bad that I can spend an entire day studying for an exam only to start it and realize that my mind is drawing blanks. It‚Äôs incredibly discouraging to see my grade on every quiz or exam I take now to the point where I just wonder what the point is in trying anymore. I truly feel as if there is basically no point in getting out of bed anymore. It‚Äôs bizarre that I feel like this too, because there‚Äôs no reason for me to feel sad and shitty. I have good friends and a wonderful girlfriend so it makes me feel even guiltier that I feel this way. Looking back on high school me, I feel way dumber too. I genuinely feel stupid now and that I‚Äôm not even cut out for college anymore. I feel like my parents would definitely feel disappointed in me if they knew how bad I‚Äôve been doing in school as of late, but at the same time it‚Äôs my own fault at this point because I no longer feel as if I can drag myself out of bed to go to class anymore. Even just showering or brushing my teeth sounds exhausting and I used to have really really good hygiene. I haven‚Äôt even felt like doing laundry in god knows how long. I find that I haven‚Äôt really been interested in anything I used to enjoy as well. It sucks because I spent a lot of money on a gaming computer a while back and I don‚Äôt even use it anymore. I just feel bored with life. Pretty much not a day goes by where I don‚Äôt think about killing myself. I‚Äôm ashamed to say that I‚Äôve done enough daydreaming about it that I know exactly how I‚Äôd do it, and what I‚Äôd want to be done for post-death arrangements. Although, I can say that I probably wouldn‚Äôt ever actually go through with it. I know that it‚Äôs a selfish thing to do but I just can‚Äôt stop thinking about it sometimes. I just feel as if it would be way easier to fall asleep and not wake up than to go about every day life. I‚Äôve felt like this for quite a while now, although I‚Äôd definitely say that the past couple of months I‚Äôve been feeling way worse (I asked my girlfriend how long she thinks I‚Äôve been noticeably feeling like crap and she said like 2ish months, but that‚Äôs because I‚Äôve been more open with her about how I‚Äôve been feeling lately. I‚Äôd say that I‚Äôve probably felt like this since around the time I started college). I do have a history of self harm. I think? As a kid I would scratch my arms as hard as I could whenever I felt sad or frustrated. I‚Äôd say that I‚Äôve probably done it again for a few times in the past month, but I guess it‚Äôs not nearly as bad as people who self harm with razor blades and stuff. I‚Äôm rather squeamish around blood so I definitely don‚Äôt think I have it in me to slit my wrists. What I find especially weird is that I can go through a good portion of my day feeling decent, and then all of a sudden feel like I‚Äôm on the verge of tears, yet I can‚Äôt cry. I have also noticed that I‚Äôve been gaining a pretty good deal in weight recently, and feel disgusted with myself.My girlfriend, who has experience dealing with her own anxiety and crippling phobia, and who has years of therapy under her  belt, says that I should see a psychiatrist, but I really really don‚Äôt want to go. For one thing, I feel uncomfortable seeing doctors and talking about my problems. Even just admitting that I might have a problem just feels weird, if that makes sense. Another thing is that I‚Äôm under my parent‚Äôs insurance plan and I‚Äôd rather not see a professional using my insurance, only for my parents to get an insurance notice in the mail. I don‚Äôt want them to know that I haven‚Äôt felt the greatest lately, and I really don‚Äôt want them to worry since they have their own problems and stuff to worry about. I also worry about being baker acted if I am completely honest with a medical professional. I know that there‚Äôs online tips like exercising or writing a schedule that could help with how I‚Äôve been feeling, but I really don‚Äôt think I have it in me to actually do them. I can‚Äôt even drag myself to my very expensive college classes that I pay for anymore, so what makes me think that i could even do that. I‚Äôm sorry for my probably incoherent ranting and for wasting anyones time reading this, but for those of you who don‚Äôt feel annoyed about my post, what‚Äôs your take on this?

People start off really liking me, and before long my depression is too much for them. now i had almost lost all hope. But then there was this person who really wanted to be my friend, showered me with compliments, said every day how much they liked me, gave me as much attention as NOBODY else had given. They even said they loved me, as a friend. And i felt the same.I thought i finally found a best friend.  promised me several times not to leave me and stay by my side. today, in fact just now, they told me they wanted to leave because my depression was too much for them. And they left. scared. Beyond words. Right now i feel nothing, but it's just the numbness of shock. I had already been almost dead emotionally, and I'm truly scared what I'm going to feel soon.

I haven‚Äôt left my house for anything except work or food for as long as I can remember. The people I would spent literal days with on zero sleep at my computer are all slowly disappearing. I don‚Äôt want them to go, but I can‚Äôt find a way to keep them around. I‚Äôm sending them money and subconsciously hoping they‚Äôll stay in touch with me for it!

depression,"o I‚Äôm not sure how I‚Äôm going to break this down‚Ä¶ but I‚Äôm alone in my room right now. I moved back to my parents house in June. It‚Äôs already almost November. I can‚Äôt believe how fast time has been passing by.I recently got back with my girlfriend. We broke up mutually in March. We had lived together for a year for the first time. During covid and all the protests etc. The day before we moved in, I cheated on her (online, but still). I told her about it and everything‚Ä¶ but then, about a year ago now, in November she went to a party which I didn‚Äôt go to (mainly because of covid and not wanting to be around people) she gave some guy her number and then ended up talking about an open relationship, etc. and then I was like ‚Äúok‚Äù as I had wanted to try one in the past, but was sorta caught off guard. o then I made a tinder etc. and wasn‚Äôt even that interested. he went on a walk with the guy and hung out with him a few more times, and lied about where she was at one point. At some point I decided to break up because it didn‚Äôt feel honest or fair. (Note that I had broken up with her at least 5 times before this in our 7 year history, sad I know.)o anyway we got back together around Christmas or a little before in December. Fast forward to February, I went to Florida to visit my Grandma who had been pretty ill. My gf just started a remote job and stayed home. When I came back, right after, she was like ‚Äúwhat are we doing‚Äù and wanted to talk about if I wanted to have kids at some point and what kind of timeline, etc. I was exhausted from being in the car for so long and didn‚Äôt feel like I had the energy to talk about it. But I think I ignored that and did anyway and it ended up becoming a big argument I‚Äôm pretty sure.  We never really came back to this because we were both really busy. And there were so many birthdays in my family coming up we got distracted.Anyway‚Ä¶ we ended up breaking up again around March 6 or so. We were just having pointless arguments and stuff. o after that it felt like we were basically still together. Then about a month later we had talked about not renewing the lease partly due to the ac unit and heat not working. Another month later she started going to this volunteer thing with her friend and ended up meeting another guy. Then she started being out late every day and she got a place with a friend of hers. And this was all around my birthday which made it hurt more.o yeah. It was very painful and I cried everyday. Especially because when we broke up, it wasn‚Äôt called breaking up and was ‚Äúconscious uncoupling‚Äù which sounds kinda stupid but she told me about it before and I think i felt like it was something different and like we would still be dating eachother. Maybe I was just naive to that.But anyway. I felt blindsided and tricked in a way. Even though yeah I think I initiated the quote unquote uncoupling.On my birthday she shared a photo of me and I saw her friend message her ‚Äúdon‚Äôt give him any birthday punani LOL‚Äù which I guess was funny to them but to me not so much. Because my gf or ex at the time messaged ‚Äúlol‚Äù or whatever back right in front of me. We were on the bed together about to watch a movie on a projector. Then she had said she would plan a birthday trip to an amusement park for me and she ended up being really lazy and not planning it and I had to myself. Because there were reservations that needed to be made in time and she did it last minute so one of my friends couldn‚Äôt go. But anyway‚Ä¶ I guess I still have resentment for this kind of stuff. o yeah the day after my birthday celebration she went on a date and had sex etc. Then I slept at my parents. And we had a long process of moving stuff out. Very drawn out for almost a month. And i almost moved to New York. But I stayed home because my mental health was what I wanted to protect.o yeah after that I didn‚Äôt pursue anybody really other than tinder (never met up) and obsessively browsed Reddit breakups and wrote like this every day. I analyzed and obsessed all day partly due to not having a job  Partly due to it being so Overwhelming. I felt hysterical and uncontrollably emotional. Crying all  the time. In public, etc.Then I worked up the courage to go to the gym to travel and see my friends and be honest with my family etc.It was slowly working and at some point I get a call or text from her and she says she‚Äôs not dating anymore.o I get really excited and happy and pursue her again and she‚Äôs been sick. o I started to bring her food and stuff because she wasn‚Äôt eating much. And I was concerned because she was at her apartment alone. Her roommate was out of town.o there I am helping her get over her new breakup in a way. At some point her friend notices my car and texts her and is mad etc. it ends up being so much annoyance. Because my ex at the time seemed different and was treating me in a weird way. he ended up being kinda mean to me and it was like i was begging her. could write more but this should be in another subreddit.

I felt I was out for a while, but here I am again. I went to a meeting. It made me realize how meaningless it all is. I've worked so hard to get here, for years I've moved forward. Now I'm staring forward, but this time it's different. For the last few years now as I looked forward it was with eyes that said ""maybe in the future"" but now it's the future. What I aimed for is almost done and as I look forward all I see is a void.  It makes as little sense as it did from the day I started.  I worked to move forward but I'm still at the same point as I was before.  Even though it's what ""I was supposed to do"" it makes just as much sense as it did from the day I started, none.  I still laze away pushing myself further and further into something I don't even understand, sure I make more money, but at what cost? I feel like I'm stuck in a hurricane. In the eye I feel calm and safe, but I'm stuck in the deepest point. I try to move out of it, but the closer I get to the end the faster the winds blow to knock me off my feet.  It's just so much easier to let myself go back to the center where I feel calm again.  Is it even possible to find my way out? I know it is, im being irrational thinking it's not, but rationality and anxiety don't exactly walk hand in hand do they? love my family, I love my friends, I love the good times I've had. I know they love me too, but that nagging voice in the back of my head tells me over and over that it wasn't real. That dark shadowy little goblin, only there to feed off everything that makes me pure. ""They don't actually like you"" ""they only pretended to enjoy themselves"" ""you didn't deserve the good times you had then""  tried to tell my mother again. he's such a beautiful woman, she truly does care, but she doesn't understand. he recommended I go to the doctor and get on benzos or anti depressants. I understand she's looking out for me, but I feel relying on a drug is a recipe for disaster. I want to believe I'm strong enough to find my way out without the help of some drug, but it's looking bleak. At this point of my life I ask myself ""would I prefer having crippling depression or a drug addiction"" and I honestly am not sure which is better. It's the most cruel ultimatum that could be thrown onto me, and here I am contemplating it. It's times like this I ask myself ""why me?""

Like 60mg (sometimes I take more if in crisis and double that dose) and all is gone, the drain, the pain, i get social and i get normal energy level, it also stop my panics attacks.Never heard anyone coping like me. I know that i'm not addicted to it I don't feel the need to take it when I'm not in that mental space and that it's not not taking it that cause my depression ( i have been suicidal since 12).Plus Xanax doesn't work on me (does nothing mentally except my body is addicted) neither antidepressants. just write it hoping someone might know why, or relate, i don't knowCodeine saved my life multiple times",1635194292,974,179

I can't keep going like this, but I can't get out, either. 8 years of college for the job I have (I teach high school) and little flexibility regarding what to do with it. Every time I try to look for something that will be less of a detriment to my mental health, I am reminded that I outearn most other people in my position; my choice is either stay in my field and take a pay cut to the point that I will not be able to afford my bills, or try and find something outside my field that pays comparatively well (not gonna happen unless I go back to school, pushing a job change down the road by 4+ years). don't have it in me anymore.

depression,last year i thought that it couldn't get any worse and now here i am and it's gotten worse. my mental state is worsening and ive been cutting more and im just exhausted all the time. i dont know how more of it i can handle but im afraid it won't be a lot. even if something good happens to me somehow i find a way to turn it bad. if something bad happens i blame it on myself. people are nice to me but i only think the worst of them and tell myself that the only reason they're nice is because they have to be. if someone actually liked me then they wouldn't leave but everyone does so obviously i have to be the problem. i dont know what i do that is so wrong but at this point i dont think i can fix it. im coming to the conclusion that ill be alone for the rest of my lifetime and ill die alone too. no matter how hard i try to put myself out there ill never be able to develop a connection with anyone because i will only ever think the worst of them. i dont know whats wrong with me and i do try to get better but ultimately nothing ever works and i go back to square one. i feel like im losing this battle and i dont wanna fight it anymore. im exhausted and sick of trying and i dont enjoy absolutely anything in my life anymore. i dont have anyone or anything to continue living for.I really did try,1635194214,1307,268

depression,"If youre disabled, people will treat you automatically worse, and the worse your disability is, the worse ""normal"" People treat you. You also likely will always be lonely, because most people see a disabled or mentally ill partner as a liability for obvious reasons. You will probably life a horrible existence, atleast if youre me. In a group home never be able to care for yourself, have an independent life, or any independence at all, or hope for betterment.  we are forced to live, and we need to hear constantly how wonderful life is, how everyone cares so much about you, and that you should never give up, or we will lock you up and forcefully drug you until you cant think straight anymore. everal psychiatrists and therapists told me the only reason they ""care"" about me, and want me to live is because of liabilities, and because their paid to do it.  its no real concern obviously. They only care about their own wellbeing. I dont have friends anymore, because i got tired of their platitudes, and blaming me, for being disabled.  people will blame you for all your circumstances, no matter what, just world fallacy. Otherwise they would realize how horribly unfair life is, and that truth would be horrible to them, unbearable.  only exist because, i dont see a painless risk free way out.

depression,"Howdy to everyone this is just a little bit about my life and how I finally turned things around and I‚Äôm hoping it could be beneficial to some of y‚Äôall. I wasn‚Äôt diagnosed with depression (MDD) and general anxiety disorder until I was 19 but I‚Äôve been struggling with it from a very young age (about 9-10). I had issues connecting with people as I had a very pessimistic and nihilistic view of life which led to me isolating myself from almost everyone. This led to an attempt on my life at a very young age. (Luckily) I survived with no permanent injury.  about 15, I self harmed for the first time. The experience was exhilarating to me, all of the happy hormones I had been missing dumped on me all at once. I would get a floaty feeling that felt incredible. (Later I learned that this was actually causing my anxiety to drop and that this is what I should feel like normally). I quickly became addicted to this feeling and would cut almost every day after school, eat, sleep, and repeat. After two years I finally gave up and began to see a therapist.  therapist was a wonderful older man. (I know many have poor experiences with theirs and I am sorry for that. Mine played such an important part in me recovering). After a few months I finally put the razor down and was able to go weeks at a time and then months. This solved the short term problem.  went off to college without self harm, but not understanding how little energy and motivation I still had. I struggled through the first year of college which ultimately ended in a mental breakdown and I went to the hospital. My hometown hospital thankfully has a very good mental health program. I talked my way out of having to go into inpatient with the promise I would do a part hospitalization program or PHP.  was a wonderful program where you had the freedom to sleep in your own bed and eat your own food but still spend most of the day in good hands. The program was very well structured and I learned that while I was not self harming, my mental health had still been deteriorating. This is when I was diagnosed and given the proper medicine to help combat my illnesses. The PHP program helped me to fix my drastically incorrect ways of thinking which has led to me enjoying almost all of my days and I want to encourage everyone to take that step if they can to help themselves as it really can be some much better. I am also here if anyone has any questions about my experiences as I did not want to type my whole life story.  everyone has a better tomorrow than today!Howdy all!

depression,"I wanted some advice. I suffer from depression, anxiety and body image problems, resulting in me only wearing oversized clothes for the last 2 years. I attend an independent boarding school in England, however rules about skirt lengths have never been particularly harsh. I have had multiple run-ins and negative experiences with the Head of afeguarding, lets call her C. We are both strong outspoken women so we often clash personalities and end up head-to-head in heated discussions. I have been struggling with body image issues and because of this, I bought over 20 skirts to assess what looks good on me (At my school because I‚Äôm an older student, we‚Äôre allowed to design our own uniforms to an extent). The ones I deemed appropriate that I feel comfortable in (barely) are all size Large.  of my skirts C said would be acceptable if I sewed up the slit on the side. I did so, and when I returned with it she revoked her statement and said it was innappropriate. The only skirt C likes is my red skirt but I feel uncomfortable in this one as it makes me feel fat. I further purchased other skirts of a similar style to the red one which C then rejected with another letter to my parents. I told her ‚ÄúMy skirts are higher at the back because i have a bum - that‚Äôs just my shape, and I‚Äôm already struggling with my body image and feeling comfortable wearing skirts.‚Äù I said ‚ÄúThis skirt would be okay on a skinny girl‚Äù as there were multiple, taller skinnier girls wearing shorter skirts than me. he retorted ‚ÄúYes but we‚Äôre talking about what looks good on you‚Äù. After this I changed at lunch and wore leggings for the rest of the day because I felt so fat and disgusting. Very fortunately, this wasn‚Äôt picked up on by any staff.  mum then got an email about the skirt I was wearing that day from C. he wrote that a female staff member had seen my underwear and said my skirt was very innappropriate. You must think my skirt was almost falling off for them to see my underwear! But it wasn‚Äôt. I was walking across a high balcony when this teacher looked up my skirt. I‚Äôm not sure which teacher it was, but I can only presume it was C who is deciding to say it was another member of staff - she has made multiple comments like ‚ÄúI can almost see your underwear!‚Äù which makes me very uncomfortable that she‚Äôs happy to say that to me. I don‚Äôt particularly want to disclose this, but for justification, the underwear I was wearing was full white cotton briefs under my opaque tights - of course they would have been seen if someone looked up my skirt from under a balcony. But I don‚Äôt think this angle could assess the length of my skirt. C continued to write in her email, as she is the Head of afeguarding that this is a safeguarding matter as my skirt is ‚Äúputting me at risk‚Äù. Damn right I agree it‚Äôs a safeguarding issue - why have staff been looking up my skirt when I‚Äôm 12 feet above them? The question is, who‚Äôs underwear WOULDN‚ÄôT they have seen?  feel degraded and humiliated. Embarrassed of me, my mum has replied saying she won‚Äôt let me into school until I can wear knee length skirts or trousers. I have a personal issue thinking knee length skirts make me look fat and ugly (because I‚Äôm not Meghan Markle) and I can‚Äôt wear trousers because then I‚Äôd have to tuck my shirt in and my trousers would expose my belly fat, when the current skirts I wear hide it quite well. We are on a school break now for 2 weeks. I feel like I mustn‚Äôt eat, so I can slim down to fit into clothes C wants me to wear.

depression,"I'm 23f, I've had clinical depression since I was around 12 or 13. I've been on 4 different antidepressant medications at different times. Every time they didn't really make me feel better, they just dulled the depression so I could at least be minimally/somewhat functional. I was a very small child I've always had a passion for music and art. I was on the Gifted &amp; Talented register at school. I learned to play piano and sing opera and performed in music shows and plays. I started composing my own music. I was the envy of other kids because of my drawing skills. I mean, I really was envied by them. I was the victim of ferocious, vicious bullying through my whole life at school because I was different and they were jealous. had a couple of very bad mental health breakdowns. One in my teens when I was 16 - I spent 4 weeks in an adolescent psychiatric hospital. Again when I was 21 - 3 weeks in an adult psychiatric ward following a suicide attempt. all of this, my music and art was what kept me going. It gave me a reason to have hope. I had at least something I could channel my creativity into and enjoy doing to distract me from the otherwise unrelenting despair and frustration that is depression. recently, over the past maybe 4 to 6 months I have noticed that my interest in my passions has been slowly fading away.  intermittent, so sometimes the enjoyment comes back for a day or two, but then it goes away again, and the general trend is that the enjoyment is decreasing.  has become increasingly difficult to pick up a pencil and start drawing, and even if I do, I have no ideas, or it feels like I've done it all before and doing it again is pointless. I haven't uploaded anything to my art Instagram page for months.  with the music. I have no more composition ideas. I used to be constantly churning out pieces like some kind of human music factory - now that creativity has run dry. If I am lucky enough to think of something, and start transcribing it, I either lose interest because it just isn't bringing me any joy, or I realise that _I've already written it._ A few weeks ago I did finally manage to write something, but I was so dissatisfied and bored throughout the entire process. I didn't feel like what I had produced was bad, it was actually very good, but still it brought me no joy whatsoever. It all just feels so pointless and completely devoid of any sense of satisfaction or achievement. especially painful because these are the things I wanted to build a career on. Especially my music. But now it all seems pointless because the only emotions I feel while doing what I love are boredom, sadness, disappointment and frustration. have nothing else. Music and art are my life. I can't get a job in anything else because I am disabled due to chronic illness that has affected both my cognitive and physical functioning.

depression,"I will do my best to be brief here but i would like to talk about something that has been going on for years now and I am reaching a point where I accept that something is wrong and that it is affecting my life in adverse ways.  some context: life now is and has been for about 6 years now, better than it has ever been in every measurable way. I am married and have two young children and they are the absolute light of my universe. In a lot of ways it seems like my life started after marrying my spouse and us having our first kid. As a child and as a younger adult, I suffered from depression and other issues, even being hospitalized and placed in residential care for roughly a year as a teenager. ince then, I have always known that there were issues with my mental health and that I had to be careful and conscientious about that because my mental state could be the driver of some pretty awful decision making. I often attempted to self-medicate with alcohol and other substances, leading only to substance abuse problems in addition to the other mental health issues I was attempting to treat.  thoughts and ideations are common and recurring problems in my life. I think the first time I considered suicide as an viable option I was roughly 7 or 8 years old. In my late teens and early twenties I did seek help on my own by talking with therapists, spiritual healers, life coaches and others who claim to help with such things. None of what they said connected with my life. Therapy did help though because at least I had someone who would listen to me and not judge. At least I could articulate how I felt and there was some value in that. to today and here is what's happening: am happier than I have ever been with my spouse and children. Our little family makes me want to embrace every day and to cherish every moment of precious time with them. My heart hurts each time I leave the house for work in the morning, even though I love my job. It feels as though i am leaving them for good and I cry a lot. I especially cry a lot when thinking about my oldest child, who is 6. I reminisce about the preceding years when I was in school full time and the child and I were together pretty much all the time. My bond with this child grew incredibly strong and in many ways, the child did what drugs, therapy, and even hospitalization could not: healed me. At least it seems that way on the one hand. I must admit that I consider suicide an option much less today because I picture my spouse having to sit the children down and explain to them why they will never see me again and that I made the choice to do that to them. Even so, I feel like my depression didn't go away but simply flowed into a new vessel, my family. Now it is my family that is used to torment me, or more accurately, how I torment myself.Every day I cry because I am obsessed with my own death and since I am agnostic, I don't believe that when I die I will get to live on. I feel like all of this love that I am feeling all of this beautiful bonding and connection between myself, my partner and our children is essentially meaningless once the first of us dies. Then will begin the absolute end of it all. How I wish I could know that we would be reunited in death! I cry every day, especially at work thinking about this. I pore over the most mundane memories of the children and my partner. I cry for those moments as if they were loved ones I lost and I am grieving them. I grieve for my loved ones as if they are gone when all I did was step out for work! This obviously causes distress and over time, I believe has serious consequences for my mental health.  you sum total it all, my life, childhood traumas and mental health issues included, you still get a very positive picture thanks to the healing that came from starting my own family. That being said, there is no denying the negative impact on my overall life and probably on my family of my having these daily tearful sessions.  anyone else here struggle with a similar set of issues? One way that I know depression is real and not a figment of the imagination or a product of circumstances is the fact that my life is basically perfect and yet I think about killing myself almost every day.

Regular therapy wasn‚Äôt helping and I got really bad, to the point where I had to try something different or be inpatient.  found a place that does DBT focused therapy and I‚Äôm in an intensive outpatient program where I go 3 times a week. Twice are therapy and once is where I learn skills. You could probably also get a group DBT class.  basically recognizes that people feel intense emotions and I think a therapy that starts from that place is super validatingA tip: try DBT if you haven‚Äôt already!!",1635184587,715,137

depression,"orry for the long text in advance! But if you read it all I will be grateful  I don‚Äôt know who to talk to so I am putting it all out there will take you to the very beginning of my problems this year  I lost my dog earlier this year actually at the 12th of January, and  it has messed me up really good. I used to be a guy who didn‚Äôt vomit or get low blood pressure, loose control of his feelings. But now I vomit frequently with the littlest of disturbances in my stomach and pass out even when running for 100 meters, I have been crying more (mind you before my dog I hadn‚Äôt cried for 7 years). During that time I was getting close to my now best friend. Also a quick side note my professional life is going amazingly. Any way let‚Äôs move a few months later to 2 months ago me and my best friend are doing great we are both going through some grief but we are together and there for each other, but during the next 2 months I feel like I work for her always running to do something for her and in general like I have been put into 2nd place in our relationship I always try to support her etc etc.  she has been dumped by her girl and she is a mess and she is rearly friendly  during the day, I feel left behind and I am fighting all of my dark thoughts alone and all my feelings. I feel like I have nowhere to stand and I can‚Äôt feel my feelings when I am alone. But still because I love her (in the friend way) I am there for here and I don‚Äôt plan not to be I think I am too god of a human to leave her hanging dry. way I don‚Äôt know what the fuck is going on and this is not all but hey I you would have to read for the next 2 hours if I put everything inside. you read this thank you and say anything down at the comments you wantI don‚Äôt know what the f to write here I am just angry sad lonely and depressed",1635183920,1811,378

depression,"A close co-worker and I were having a beer this weekend. We got into a really deep conversation about life and whatnot. He mentioned that he really doesn't have any friends. ure, he has co-workers that he calls friends, but they aren't really good friends. More like work buddies. I'm probably the closest to him. He said, I'm the only one he gets drinks with from time to time. He said most of his real friends are back home where he's from. He's hasn't lived there in nearly 20 years. I said so, u don't have anybody here. He said he has his wife, and one other friend, but has nobody else to go hang out with. I asked why that was. He mentioned that he's met many people, gets close and something happens. Either life gets in the way or betrayal. Because of this he just doesn't care anymore about making friends. He's ok with being a bit of a loaner. But I can tell he's not very happy. question to you all. Is this a form of depression? It just seems so weird that he's okay with being alone for the most part.

depression,"I just started working again. 9 hour shifts, which kills me, but I don't really have a choice. The company is alright, just your average soul-sucking corporate company with 'friendly' people who promote yoga but would turn their back on you the second you mention mental health. be fully honest, I am very suicidal - but not actively. I was swinging back and forth, and I asked myself what was keeping me here. Like for many of us, the answer is my mom. o I told myself I would stand whatever was to come; I would go through hell and back, just to make sure she doesn't have to bury her kid. Once she's gone, then I would have fulfilled my wish and I can leave in peace. it's easier said than done. Things got hard - very, very hard. Cancer, hospitalizations, a chronic illness, eating disorders, death. All in the span of a year or so. I take anti-depressants (Buproprion 300mg) and klonapin for anxiety.  was dreading this job since the second they made the offer and I accepted. The pay is good yeah. It's supposedly ""helping me achieve my goals of moving to another country"" (aboslute bullcrap, I have no dreams on this Earth). My family was happy, and my stepdad reacted very poorly when a few months back I had to quit a job after a mental breakdown due to a lot of situations, specially an abusive boss.  truth is I don't know how to do it. Today is day one. In the span of one morning, I have made four different suicide plans. I don't know how to stand this while aware - the only way I could stand this is if I became detached. If there was a pill that turned me into a little robot that performed her tasks, then went to sleep, rinse and repeat, I'd be happy to let it take over.  know jobs always suck the first week, but it's not that. It goes beyond that. It's about how do I manage to stay alive, when all I want is to be gone. How do I find a way. I prepared myself for two weeks mentally and it crumbled down the second I started working, having to put on fake smiles and going through the endless corporate crap, and on top of that the stress of having to learn how to use a Mac which I hate. do I keep my head above the water. How can I be a semi-functioning adult, because as Queen said ""the show must go on,"" and despite how much I would go hang myself from a tree the love I feel for my mom overcomes it all. But I know she's also sad watching me crumble, become an empty shell. It happens every time. I log in, work, log off. Youtube, go to sleep. I usually skip dinner.  works 12 hours shifts so if we see each other it's by pure luck. How do I do this. What do I hold onto. How can I survive this.

depression,"orry if anything in this vent/rant sounds odd, i'm not a native english speaker basically, I (14f) got diagnosed with mild depression a few weeks ago. I didn't think too much of it since the only thing i struggled with was personal hygiene/keeping my room clean etc. I also self-harm but it doesnt cause lasting physical damage so i kinda didnt think about it too much either.  i've entered probably the worst depressive episode in my whole life. In my country we had fall break, so i spent most of my time home. Fall break ended yesterday and on that day i argued with my mom alot. I like to think of myself as a child that doesnt cause too much trouble, ive never consumed alcohol or anything of the kind, i dont go out late, i get mostly good grades, i've been playing the piano for 9 years, i've started to learn programming in our schools robotics-club. This is how it's been like ever since i can remember. My older is the total opposite of me. hes more direct, goes partying alot, we dont know if she'll pass her graduation exam and in general she doesnt seem to care for school. When she has emotional/aggressive outbursts, my mom always brushes it off, because ""thats just how she is"", when she randomly insults me or is rude to me and i wanna defend myself my mom always goes ""you cant change her, thats just how she is"". Now, this weekend its been different. As i already mentioned, we argued because i feel like i am treated differently compared to my older sister and ever since then she hasn't spoken a single word to me (i have to admit that i said some pretty rude things so i can understand her being mad at me). My dad left me, so my mom is the only parent i can talk to. I have 3 tests coming up this week and 2 next week. To me, thats a lot, even tho i do pretty well in most of the subjects. The fact that my mom is so mad at me that i cant even talk to her about it and doesnt try reaching out to me is whats been worrying me the most. hes gonna be even more mad if i fail my math test (which will probably happen) even though i study lots. Most of my teachers expect me to do well. All this stress for the next 2 weeks and the fact that i cant talk to anyone about it is making me feel so drained. Ive cried almost every day for the past week. I dont wanna do this anymore. It takes me everything to keep myself from crying at school. My eyes and my head hurt constantly. Whenever i used to talk with my mom about the fact that i dont like it that everyone treats me like an adult even though i'm a teenager she always said ""well you wanna act like an adult so youre gonna get treated like one"" even though the  reason why most adults consider me ""grown up"" is my pessimistic/cynical outlook on life.

depression,"I just hate the way I am and having social anxiety has made me a terrible person. I am 21 years old and have never been in a committed relationship or had many sexual partners which makes me extremely depressed. I have had a total of 2 sexual partners and they were long term fwb arrangements (11 and 18 months.) I did have feelings for these girls but due to the massive discrepancy in sexual histories between us, I did not feel like a man around them and could never get myself close to committing to these people. The only thing that kept me with them was fear of loneliness. After ending things with the last one 11 months ago  I have been the most depressed ever. All I want is for someone to actually love me and not just like me cause they think I'm naive enough to date the town bike. Because I have anxiety I unfortunately can not speak to girls in public or in the halls or library at my school, the only places I can meet girls. The ones in my classes are all unattractive except for one but I know she dosent give a fuck about me. At my job there are a few cuties but they either have boyfriends or are still in high school which is the biggest turnoff ever. I have no options to meet anybody except for putting it all on the line in a public place and very likely get rejected. I freeze up in situations around any girl I find cute cause I just don't know what to say to make  her actually like me. I just wish I was good enough to create demand in other people to ask me out. I would at least feel confident if people showed they are interested in me. Instead I have to put it all on the line for other people to choose if I am worthy or not. I fucking hate my life.

depression,"I had a panic attack yesterday. last few weeks I've been working part time as a dishwasher at a nice little restaurant.  I was offered a serving shift as one of the ladies needed the day off.  I was a waitress for many years and loved it.  I just stopped years ago because I wanted something better. thought moving to a small town where few people knew me would be a good thing.  I would get a job at the local factory as a janitor.  I could be left alone for a while while I try getting sober.  It worked.  For a little while.  I mean I stayed sober.  I was happy.  I got my first car.  Was making a decent wage.  However, the people in the factory were miserable.  Nosy.  tupid.  Not all of them.  Just the old timers.   almost went out of their way to fuck with anyone who had a smile on their face.  o when the new hire I had trained started making unwelcome moves on me they thought it was funny when I wasn't smiling anymore.  I tried to deal with it with kindness.  I tried talking to management.  Next thing I know this dude got my address from the stack of payroll envelopes HR would leave out for anyone to look through.  He showed up.  He got my number.  He started harassing me.  The more I resisted the more he took it I was playing hard to get.  The co workers seemed to egg him on.  It seemed no one took it seriously except me.  They thought it was hilarious. didn't take him long to move up to lead hand.  Being the guy who got out of jail and wanted to turn his life around.  He really got in with the management crowd.  I was terrified.  I moved to the next town over.   I essentially allowed myself to be bullied until one day I just quit my job.  At that point I had almost completely isolated myself out of fear of him or anyone there knowing anything about me.  I just lied about where I lived, what i did, who i knew.  I went into hiding out of fear all the while trying to show up and continue working so I could live.   I regret this.  I just reacted out of fear.  I was convinced they were all out to get me.  For what?  I don't know.  Not fitting in?  Being young and happy?  Having a life? go by.  I avoid the town.  Can't even visit friends there without feeling like someone maybe watching.  It's likely all in my head but I don't know how to make the fear go away. yesterday.  I'm doing my shift.  I'd agreed to it after feeling quite confident that I wasn't going to see these people there or let it affect me.  It had been weeks and I hadn't seen any of them.  Of course, my first day on the floor.  It wasn't him.  It was a coworker of his.  One that I know has nothing better to do than tell the creep he had seen me.  I panicked.  I ran to the kitchen and told the cook my story.  He's had a rough go himself so he understood and automatically went out to make his presence known.  It was nice.  Just to feel like he had my back.  He's such a sweet old dude. just feel embarrassed and stupid.  It was likely an over reaction on my part.  It dawned on me while talking to him later before we closed the restaurant for the night.  I realized just how traumatized I am by that whole thing that happened with that factory.  Just how much it affected me.  How do I just let go and not be scared?  I like my new job.  I never remember being this affected in my life.  I used to be pretty chill and confident.  I don't see why I have to be this way.  I want to change.  I want to enjoy that town again.  I want to be fearless once again.  I used to use drugs to cope with that.  I don't have them to fall back on anymore. morning I'm just a wreck.  Like reliving that stressful period.  Flashbacks.   don't want to move and run away from my problems again.  How do I let this shit go? moved to that town because my dad lived there when I was a kid.  It symbolized happy times for me.  I saw it as salvation.  It was my dream come true.  It was so good the first 2 years.  Now I just feel stupid most of the time.  Like I did all that work on myself just to end up worse off.

depression,"I've been going thru bullshit for years and years without end, and it's beaten me down mentally so badly at this point I cannot stand on my own.  And two days ago or three days ago my entire left side of my mouth starts hurting so badly I can't even chew bc I have a broken tooth on the right side.  My kids seem to hate me, I live in my ex's basement with no walls, I'm obese, I have delusions, and I don't trust myself to be able to work a regular job bc I cannot handle even the slightest of triggers at this point.

The hackers have now blocked communication with my mom probably bc she helped me, and I already went to the psych ward for help n was discharged and I feel like things have only gotten worse, no chill at all my mouth hurts so bad and I'm getting a chapped sore thing in the corner.  I refused to take meds bc I think ppl will steal my meds or just poison me with them.  I think my life is a simulation and I've told mental health ppl at the hospital this and yet I'm still experiencing it and expected to just be able to fix my fucked up life with my fucked up mind.  Before I could manage ok until they messed with my medication and then the mental abuse at home and the simulation and isolation just drive me into where I'm at now.

If your mind is fucked and if you're bullied, you are up against opposition and you don't have the tool you need to overcome.  If they attack your mind and fucking hurt you bad then you need help.  Fuck I'm not going to respond well to that bullshit n I know I'm gonna hear it.  I knew my teeth were going to be an issue before it even started n that just tells me it's no accident.  The fact I couldn't get in to a dentist for a super long time and that the only job I could get was one that refused to offer benefits made it so I couldn't get health care for years.  Now I have insurance I have to wait several months to see anyone and it's going to be a death trap trying to drive an hour away for care in a vehicle that the tires are bald in the snow cos I can't afford tires.  This is what I get for trying to get on my fucking feet.  I don't do drugs, I rarely drink alcohol, Im faithful to one person sexually, and I stay away from most ppl to avoid drama bc ppl I thought were my friends just fucking attack me and I have no clue why.  o I stopped trying to talk to ""friends"".

depression,"  Be your own pen¬†pal. I just did this for myself, and it has made me feel better. If you don't know how to start, you can read how I did it for myself below. I always end by saying I love myself, and something positive. This part is the most important! I recommend you try it, even if you don't feel that way at the moment. tart a conversation with yourself, talk through your story, and get to know you. You are lovely üíó Feel free to take it from the me that believes in you. do not like the person I have been. he is lazy, conflict-avoidant, and has not reached out to one of her best friends in a while. he is hyper-focused on the future and bored with her current life, so she opts to live in other worlds through a screen constantly and dream up possible futures for heself. he has people that care about her, yet she is lonely. he has a roof over her head, yet it does not feel like her space. Her room is messier than she wants it to be, she is not doing great academically, and most of all, she is scared. This girl needs a lot of help, it‚Äôs easy to tell. But not all from her friends. he needs it from herself. Could you need it from yourself as well? hurt my relationship with myself when I stopped caring for myself in a way that helped. Over time, I stopped doing the things that made me feel healthy and well off. oon enough thereafter, my maladaptive coping mechanisms became harder to break as they became the routine. I only do things when I feel enough pressure to do them. And that threshold has increased over time. It takes more risk and negative concequence to get me to care for my body, and to care about poor assignment grades. After months of feeling this way and being faced with uncertainties I don‚Äôt know how to confront, I have placed myself in an emotional low point that is starting to threaten my friendships and my academic progress if I don‚Äôt change something. I am tired of being this person. I have reached the point where my emotional instability is starting to affect my life too much, and I am ready to confront myself.¬† is me doing that: you need to get out of this. You don‚Äôt feel well. You are scared for your future and feel awful in the moment. You cry by yourself more now. You are recieving signals about how you feel about your situation and your life. It is time to start listening to yourself and do something different, because this isn‚Äôt working. Right now, I am here for you. I feel your pain. It is hard to look around and see the dished pile up, to feel the pain in your lower back from laying down too long and to not brush your teeth enough. It is hard to be scared of your future and do work. It is hard to attend classes when you are crying and feel weak, drained even. I know, because I have been dealing with these things for the last three weeks. I am going to change some things because I need to. I don‚Äôt like how things are, so I can change them. Do not discredit yourself for what you have accomplished in this time. You have done well to hold out. My current self is taking over now. And you know what? he isn‚Äôt far away from you. he is strong, she is capable. he is going to do things that will make her feel better, and she will do things that are hard for her to do because she knows she needs to do them. he knows what it feels like to slowly do worse and worse now, so she can try to find her own solutions.¬† know I can help myself. It‚Äôs going to be hard, and I will probably feel sad for a while. I might get emotionally drained and then work through it, rather than sleep in. I want to feel better, so I will fight for it. I want to stop avoiding things, so I will do my work and be honest with where I am at with others. Take it step by step. Think about today, today. Think about tomorrow, tomorrow. And don‚Äôt forget your trusty pen pal is free to talk to whenever you need her. he will always be here for you, no matter what. Depend on yourself. You are weak, and you are strong. These two can be true at the same time. It is okay. You are okay. And I love you, Nhi. I love you so much I will do what you need to feel better.¬†Be your own pen pal.",1635179790,4123,814

My best friend is married and moved to Virginia with her husband recently so I drove 9 hours to go see them and that's when all these emotions I've been hiding kinda came back up, me and her actually lived together our junior and senior year of high school due to having issues with both our parents so we matured and had to act like adults really young and its just hard seeing her continue to grow and do all the things wed do together and im over here stuck in college. I never really wanted to go to college to learn, I simply just love running track but I can't run if I don't go to school. im sorry im throwing a lot out right now im just lost in my life. im dating this boy and its amazing but this past weekend I had to get my spare key from a guy I lived with before living with my best friend, we dated for almost 3 years and seeing him and the dogs that we had got together just again brought up a lot of emotions for me. Im and only child but I take care of my baby cousin a lot and just how everything in my life has played out I've just been the backbone for everyone, if someone needed something I always made sure they were good and they all knew they could count on me so I pushed a lot of my feelings a side for a long time and now they just sit in the bottom of my heart it seems like. im gonna stop here and just see what you guys have to say but id be more then happy to share more. thank you for whoever takes the time to read this mess, im sorry.college depression",1635179079,1976,402

depression,"Hi folks, i hope you're doing well... If not, i wish you well..o, lately I've been trying to help as much as possible on reddit by replying to other people's posts... Through this post, i hope i am able to relieve some of the stress and get some meaningful advice. my father is a sick controlling bastard who is the biggest narcissistic mf on earth. Everything is about him. After a big fight last year and continuous tiffs since then, i decided to maintain a distance and only indulge in talking whenever necessary. To this, now he complains of me to not having a discussion with him for anything and everything in my life. In my culture, we don't disrespect the elders (at least publically) and he takes advantage of the same and tries to demean me, my mom, or my sister (married).For every move he makes, there's a hidden agenda that benefits him down the line. For eg: we just have built our home after investing a lot of money (even took some loans) and now he wants to move out of this place and go to a small town so that he can buy a bigger place with the same amount. In between, he'll keep some money for himself which according to him will be invested in our family business. He'll later claim that there were some losses in the business and the invested money is now gone(which would obviously be spent on luxuries for himself) while me, and my mother tend to live like misers to save each penny.When we resist him, he creates mental pressure on us to make the decisions in haste without thinking. He's done that multiple times and we've only our house and a small factory left. The rest, he has sold and wasted. That is why, we(me, and mom) are determined to stay in the same place despite the hefty loans.  we had a fight and he threatened to leave and commit suicide blaming us for it. But, then after a long talk focused mostly on how we have mentally tortured him and driven to this point over the years, he is sort of back to normal.I'm on the verge of finding someone and getting married. For his hidden intentions mentioned above, he looks for a match outside the state so that he can force us to move out. Further, his mother, brother fuels the fire inside him and poisons his mind against us. After seeing all this, I'm in a dilemma. ometimes i think i shouldn't get married as my partner would witness all this nonsense and don't know if my marriage would be successful. On the other hand, i feel that we can have a re-start. Idk guys, can you share some advice? Thanks in advance!Venting out and advice",1635178929,2526,469

I am broke most of the time due to medical and car issues that sprang up adding to my stress levels and I try and try but often still end up thinking of my ex. he still has some of my things and won‚Äôt talk to me.

depression,"Just going to write as short as i can about my situation. since I was born, i never got along with people. They did their thing, i interacted with everyone as little as possible and i lived in my own world. ince 6 years old I've been living the same way - passing the time at the computer, that's the only way i know how to live. I was already nervous in childhood, but i didn't pay much attention to the world at all until i was a teenager. I suppose maybe that's when I started getting depressed. Doctors thought I have some form of neurosis, then depression, OCD, and eventually aspergers and schizoid personality(these are 'diagnosis for observation'). The longer I lived the worse my anxiety and depression got. I did over a year of psychiatrist visits and therapy, and barely achieved anything at all. Eventually it got so bad that I dropped out of everything, and unsurprisingly, it became my downfall.  just realized that I can't keep living like this, being stuck on my computer without any life to speak of. Can't even force myself to do basic chores, and I've been this way all along. In the last couple weeks/months my state has been spiraling downwards, and eventually i figured i have no choice but to go to a mental hospital, even though i doubt they can help me and it's the last thing i'd want to do. My anxiety became so bad i've become traumatized after just a few days of suffering from the feeling of being crushed alive by stress, i take benzodiazepines now and i doubt i can survive without them. I thought that'd be good enough, but then depression assaults me, so my situation is still fucked. Lately, every day feels like a struggle to get through. It's wearing me down and honestly I don't think I'm gonna be able to survive like this. Just getting to the next year while feeling like this seems like the most difficult thing to do. tried pushing myself more than a thousand times to change things, to change everything. But it never worked. I feel like I've already suffered so much I don't want to try anymore. None of over 10 drugs helped me and i barely did anything at therapy, because i have zero drive to do anything and a dislike to everything in real life. Honestly, i don't know why i'm writing this. I'm desperate, but there seems to be no way out for me. I'm pretty much convinced the only way for me to feel better is to change my life completely, so work, exercise, do social stuff etc. but instead, i've been stuck browsing the same few sites on the internet for years. I feel like i'm buried alive under the weight of things I should do, and being the kind of person who can't force himself to even brush his teeth or take walks. tired, very tired. Miraculuously in my situation I managed to make some money, but it doesn't make me happy. I'm considering blowing my money on some kind of priviate psychiatric clinic, because public ones in my country are terrible, and i'm stuck waiting for a free place. Don't know what else to do. I feel like I'm way too fucked now for even therapy to help me, and unless I'm going to stabilize my depression and other emotions through drugs, i'm gonna lose my mind and die or worse. that's about it. It's probably the lowest point of my life and I doubt it will go away on it's own. I feel like I've been depressed for more than 5 years, but the way I feel now is incomparable to before. I've been able to survive all this time, but now even survival is too hard, not to mention being functional. If by some miracle psychiatric drugs won't finally start working and lessen my depression and anxiety to a bearable level, I won't be able to do anything or live any longer. I'm holding on to desperate hope because it's the last thing I have left...after that, there will be only death waiting for me.My life - i supposedly have asperger, but depression and anxiety destroyed me.",1635173960,3856,710

depression,"I‚Äôve been an alcoholic for years now, it started when I was 16 when I couldn‚Äôt handle the literally crippling depression anymore. It‚Äôs the only thing that really makes me feel like myself these days, I do other drugs but it hits the sweet spot for me. I‚Äôve been to two rehabs, both times I was told I was a lost cause and both times my drinking came back even harder. Been to hospital several times for withdrawals, thats mainly why I started to quit, but now I just don‚Äôt drink all day every day and I can avoid that crap. Got a big bottle of brandy by my side, slowly forgetting my troubles. Life is just so directionless, meaningless, empty. I lost almost all of my friends due to depersonalisation disorder from weed and I just don‚Äôt feel like a whole person anymore. I‚Äôve accepted my drinking at this point, I have no other alternative. Everything is just pain.

depression,"Rant. Ignore this if you want. I don't really care. But don't give me grief, thanks. like someone and wanted to be close with her. he was in a relationship but went through a recent breakup (June). Regardless of that she got relatively close to me even on a physical level, and so I felt like this was an approval of my feelings. she kept her distance, knowing what I wanted, and asked for some time for herself. didn't really want that.. but still let her do her thing. That is, until I wanted some clarification of the situation. This didn't go well and so, for my own well-being, I decided to cut her off for some time to get my own distance and allow myself to reconsider the friendship, as well as take time out to grieve. Now she seems to be upset but still wants to keep me close as a friend. all very uncertain and I feel extremely hurt and angry. My heartstrings were being tugged at this whole time and being played with. I really cared about her. This issue has been ongoing for months, with no closure provided to me whatsoever. he never fully rejected me. I feel used and abandoned. Like a fool. should clarify, and I'm not blaming anyone for this, but my mental health has deteriorated rapidly during this time. I am suicidal, been sent to the hospital multiple times. I blame myself for her needing space (as if I freaked her out) and feel as though I let her down by developing feelings. I was angry at myself for the longest time. she won't let me get as close as me as I would want, it will hurt me. I realise this now. I also realise that wanting to be with someone you have feelings for and not being able to have this intimacy is probably one of the most devastating feelings we can have on an emotional level and it takes time to accept this. My best friend of five years does not seem to understand the impact that the situation has had on me. I have been giving this girl space for months now.. since July, I think. But when I finally opened up to him about what had happened - just recently - he told me to drop the ""victim mentality"" and to let her grieve over the breakup / stop contacting her. He said that she does not have the energy to deal with me or my problems, which I can understand even though that is not what this is about, and that my mindset is ""toxic"". I just wanted clarity. I'm angry, yes, but not because of what she's going through. I'm angry that she led me on for so long, knew how much I liked her, and still won't tell me whether or not she wants to take things further. I have respected her need for space, and still do. But it's been three fucking months, man. This girl was everything to me. A close friend and someone I genuinely cared about. We used to talk all the time, and now I just feel like I have been left with no answers. But my friend just completely disregarded this. He basically told me that my feelings were invalid.My best friend of 5 years told me that I need to drop the ""victim mentality"" and got frustrated with me because I feel hurt that the person I want to be with won't let me be with her for whatever reason, and refuses to provide me with clarity.",1635164444,3128,601

Today was supposed to be my first day at my academy, I was so excited for it, it means the world to me because I've never worked and It made me feel like I'm one step closer to becoming independent. Long story short the academy is just outside of town which means I have to take the bus to get to it. And I couldn't even do that, I fucked up completely. I was supposed to catch the first one from here, which would then drop me of at the edge of town, where I could take the next one that drives there. However I didn't understand that's how it worked and instead of getting off at the stop I just stayed on it and kept going. By the time I realized it wasn't driving any farther it was too late, so I came back home and started punching things because I'm sick of this shit. I'm sick of not even being able to use a bus. I was already anxious and this just made it so much worse and discouraged the shit out of me. Yes i know it's not the end of the fucking world but it doesn't make it any better, this was supposed to be my first day, and I failed already.

He started crying. Telling that he's sad and wants to die. aid that he tried coke and various other drugs. Also said that his girlfriend is pregnant and that's why he's so sad. Next day he apologized to everyone and said that it was alcohol. We tried talking and he said that he's sorry, but nothing bad is going on. o couple of months later he announced that they're having a baby. My family took it way better than I expected. They were happy and everything. I felt that everything that he said during that birthday was true. But he seemed alright and we talked and everything was really cool. They had their baby a couple of months ago. They married and it seemed that it's great. But then my bro said that he has depression. He's going to doctors and he's getting the help he needs. I was happy that he's trying to sort things out. And this weekend we were at our cousins birthday, had some drinks and he argued with one friend that weed is good.

Holding down a job would be nearly impossible for me in this state. Maybe things will change once I'm far, far away from my abusive household?

depression,"Hi all,  hope this is an okay place to vent.  the past half-year I've just been kind of doing nothing. I just finished my university career, which was a huge emotional and mental struggle in of itself, and over the past few months I've gone through yet another struggle of that kind during my little respite from university before I attempt to enter the real world. the sake of my own sanity, I do not want to go into details, it makes me uncomfortable and I am paranoid about both being discovered and doxxed. I had enough anxiety making a reddit account as is, and I don't want more. being said, to say the least, I have been feeling very blue over the past while and I am genuinely a bit aversive, if not scared, of finding or entering another relationship because I am scared another women will do the exact same thing to me that was already done. now, months later, I can still read what was said to me in my head: that I am a awful human being, a manipulator, a narcissist, lacking in empathy, so on and so forth, and it lives in my head so much so that it's reduced my self-esteem to nil and has broken my own conception of self.  lives rent free in my head, constantly circling between the forefront and background of my mind. The past few days I've had on and off bouts of crying because some music reminds me of it, or because it just floods my head. I have had times, on and off, where I compulsively go through a bit of an episode of doing tests to figure out if I am a manipulator, a narcissist, a horrible human being, and I cannot find solace in any answer. say the very least I have internalized these words hurled at me, and I cannot help but feel like I am a massive pile of garbage. I am fearful going forwards that I am going to be viewed as damaged-goods, and that I will have no intimate or fruitful relationships because I am a bad person. All of these feelings make me feel deeply blue and it feels like there's no escape and that perhaps maybe I am simply just a very bad person. I feel ugly, dirty, vile, and like a loathsome creature. I feel belittled and small, I feel stupid and inferior. I feel that I am not good enough for anybody, that I am worthless and unlovable.  what my few friends have told me, and what my therapist keeps telling me, I am in doubt, and starting to worry that I am lying about my own emotions to manipulate people into feeling empathy for me. I feel like I am being driven insane.  I think have internalized very deeply what was said and hurled at me and it's killing me emotionally and mentally. past few months have also driven me to be on and off passively suicidal. I do not think or anticipate I will harm myself, but the thoughts float around in my head and it comes and goes in intensity. feel like a burden, a disappointment, and a nuisance to everyone around me. I feel like nobody actually likes me, that people merely tolerate me either out of pity or because I'm useful to laugh at because I'm an idiot that doesn't recognize that they're an idiot.  feel like nothing, like I am in an emotional limbo, like I am completely and totally withered and dead inside. I don't even know who I am at all anymore.  I know is that I feel very melancholy and perhaps even deeply emotionally scarred, if that's not silly to say. am currently seeing a therapist (who I started seeing because of the events of the past few months and what had been done / said to me), who, in agreement with my doctor, seems to think that I am an obsessive thinker, and perhaps have some form of mild OCD, and I am slated to potentially to go on low-dose medication for it because of my endless rumination and obsessive thinking. in the advance for the post, just don't know what to do. I feel like I am at the ends of my sanity, and as if I am being torn apart from the inside-out. Additionally, sorry if my writing is erratic.

depression,"I considered using a burner account for this, but I'm always much more of a lurker than a poster on Reddit so it's not too important to me. And eh, I don't really care anyway, I'm generally pretty open about these things with people I know anyway, it's not some big secret or anything. then, first of all, to be clear, I'm in a ""stable"" place right now, so I don't want anyone panicking thinking I'm on the cusp of ending my own life or anything. Yes, I would much rather be dead than alive. Yes, if I had the willpower to commit suicide, there is a very real possibility I would've done it by now. Yes, I've gotten over the barrier of worrying about what those who care about me would think and just selfishly want this all to end by this point. But... as I just implied, I don't have the willpower to go through with it, as much as I would honestly like to. I don't know why, truthfully. I don't know if there's still some survival instincts left in me, I don't know if I subconsciously still worry about how it would affect the few that do care about me, I don't know if I'm simply too much of a bitch to journey in to the unknown and see what's on the other side, or maybe a combination of them all, but I simply cannot go through with it at this point in my life. orry, I tend to worry about others way before I worry about myself so I just wanted to get that out there so nobody who views/reads this goes in to panic mode trying to save my life or anything. Just trying to vent in an environment where I don't have to worry so much about what I say since none of you know me personally, that's all. all of those disclaimers out of the way... it's tough, man. And I feel awful saying that, since in theory, I have plenty of opportunity and things to be grateful for. Now, yes, I'm in my 20s now and still haven't done anything with my life (and even though I know that's something us depressed folk oftentimes say, it is legitimately very true in my case) but I still have things to be grateful for despite that. I still have things I HOULD be grateful for. I mean, I have a roof over my head, food on the table with the lights on, for one. Already not doing too shabby. I live with parents who, while they don't quite have a grasp on or understanding of clinical depression (even though my mother went through it herself and has a history of mental illness, which is strange since you'd think she would understand it better given that fact) they still do try their best to care and do anything they can to help, and they're always very patient with me (clearly, given the fact that I'm still stuck here in my early 20s.) Frankly they didn't do a particularly good job of raising me, but they both at the very least tried hard to do good, even if they didn't succeed. I admit I don't have any real life friends and have a completely dead social life, but I do have multiple friends online who I do consider to be true friends, despite the fact that I only see them in person once in a blue moon. ome of them even struggle with mental illness same as me and do, in fact, understand these things and what I'm going through. I have a good support structure. I did good in school, while I was in it. And I don't want to come off as though I'm stroking my own ego here, you'll have to take my word that I'm not the type of person to do that, but a lot of people I've talked to have said that I come off as very intelligent and well-spoken, even if I very much disagree with that assessment. o there's plenty of potential there for me to succeed, to do good, and... to just live a decent life. Doesn't have to be perfect. I don't even have to be happy. All I've ever wanted was a decent, quiet life, where I was just... content. urely that can't be that much to ask for. yet here we are. in my life, my step-brother died, hit by a car, driver didn't even realize they hit anything at first. I wouldn't have been any older than maybe 3 or 4. Completely tore our once happy family apart. My whole extended family was devastated, my father became a much more angry, apathetic man, my mother pretty much immediately acquired depression and PTD as well as some minor alcoholism, all of which she's thankfully recovered from. That was it. That was the precise moment in which everything went to hell. I have the rare... ""luxury"" of having an exact, precise moment in time to point to in which I can say ""That's when everything started going downhill for me."" despite this, I still had a mostly happy childhood, thank god. At least I had one happy moment in my life. But the beginning of the end of my happiness was already showing, as I had developed severe anger management issues, which no doubt stemmed from all of the internalized trauma of dealing with the loss of my step-brother at such a young age. My brain just didn't know how to process it. It just... broke. Even if I didn't consciously realize it until years and years later. dealt with it. Nowadays I'm very mellow, I don't tend to get very angry. Frustrated, sure, maybe, but not truly angry and enraged on a regular basis like I used to. But... well, you know about the Hydra, the mythological creature, yeah? For those of you who have seen films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe: ""Cut off one head, two more shall take it's place."" Yeah... that's been my experience with mental illness throughout my life. Deal with one, two more take it's place. that... things actually didn't seem too bad. Very rapidly I might add, over the course of maybe a couple weeks, I just... started not being as angry. Didn't even really have to do much. It just... stopped. Like I just experienced a sudden paradigm shift for no discernible reason. Then came the worsening social anxiety and extreme constant panic and anxiety. And those last two in particular, man, really made the anger issues feel like a breezy walk in the park. panic stuff... it was constant. Always thought that the world could end at any moment, maybe it already is ending, and just an overlying fear of the future and general constant fear and panic, as well as separation anxiety stemming from said fear and panic. Lasted for months, and thus far it's been the only time in my life that I've needed sleeping medication to actually be able to fall asleep. Keep in mind of course that I was barely even in to adolescence by this point too, going through this as a grown ass adult is one thing, but going through it at that age is something else entirely. Honestly, I don't remember much of it. It's the only time in my life that's mostly blanked out from my memory. Tells you how bad it was, I suppose. Got so bad my brain just decided to say ""Nope, not remembering that. top trying to."" ocially... well, I've gotten better. I wouldn't exactly say I'm a social butterfly or anything, but I am at least coherent and people don't feel weird or awkward around me or anything, although I'm still obviously not perfect in that regard. And I wouldn't say I approach social situations with immediate fear any more, so I've at the very least improved in that regard. came the depression. Honestly, I could just end the post there and I'm sure most of you would understand. If there's a metaphorical dragon on a mountain I'm faced with, after so many other beasts I've somehow managed to conquer... depression would be it. A seemingly insurmountable problem, a seemingly unbeatable threat, a seemingly inhumanly impossible task. I've got a little dinky, half-broken steel sword, and I'm faced with a 1,000 foot tall, fire-breathing monster. I mean, how in the hell am I expected to win in that situation. In THI situation. How would ANYONE be expected to win under those circumstances. But life ain't fair, and that's the situation we're all facing, myself included. been years now of just absolute, abject, torment. Misery. Numbness, if I'm lucky. Maybe once every ten months or so, I'll have, if I'm lucky... a day. Maybe two. Where I genuinely feel... alright. Maybe even on the verge of genuine happiness. Then it all just gets ripped away and the depression comes back, and I just feel even worse than I did before the brief glimpse of happiness. wish I was never born. Genuinely. I didn't choose this. I so, so, so badly, and so selfishly, just want my life to end. For this all to just end so I don't have to deal with it any more. I've gone through ten lifetime's worth of pain within the span of a decade. And I'm not even 21. And I'm tired, I'm exhausted, and ready to keel over and just... stop. To just rot away in a corner and be forgotten about. Because I know that I'm a failure and a train wreck on all fronts, I know I've let everyone around me down and will continue to do so, that I've let myself down and will continue to do so, and that this bloodline which goes back generations and generations and generations will, unfortunately, end with me. One way or another. I can't pull the trigger. I can't slide the blade down my wrists. I can't tie the noose. I can't jump. I just can't. It's like an invisible barrier just... prevents me from ending my own life, even though by this point I honestly desire death even more so than I desire any sort of recovery. Because I know that even if I did somehow recover, I would be forever tainted by all of this, and I'd never be truly happy or content. All of the emotional and mental pain I've experienced would haunt me and follow me for the rest of my life like a shadow. And that's no way to live. But... something just will not damn well let me. Maybe I am just a coward. Either way, I'm just trapped in this nightmare that I want to end, but... no matter how much I want to wake up, I don't. I'm just completely trapped, unable to kill myself, but honestly not wanting to live any more, honestly wishing I never did live to begin with. envious of those who have built up the willpower to face the unknown, and go through with it. The peace they must feel. It's funny how it's evolved in me over time. From being horribly depressed, but thinking I'd never kill myself, why would I? To having fleeting thoughts of it, but still being steadfast in never doing it. To... WANTING to not do it... but realizing there's a possibility I might in the future. To holding a knife up to my wrist, but not going through with it. To desperately wanting to do it, but not going through with it due to me not wanting to emotionally injure those around me. To not caring and just wanting this torture to end, but... not being able to, despite wanting to do it. To bring it all full circle, it honestly is like being stuck somewhere between hell and purgatory. Being torn apart in all directions, wanting it to just end... but not being able to end it. I can only hope that the next step in my evolution is having the willpower to go through with it and ending the mistake that is my life. people say your THIRTIE is when everything starts going downhill... heh. Can't wait to see what that'll be like if this is what my twenties has in store for me, if I even make it that far, god forbid... on the off chance anyone does read this and I'm not just shouting in to the void, thank you.

You're so well versed at telling people you're great, you even know how to make jokes and you can laugh away any suspicion. confide in no one, because you know you'll either get more grief off people constantly asking if you're okay, and then when you're not you'll just lie again anyway, so might as well lie from the start. go to work, get good feedback at work, come home and pretty much do fuck all and lie in bed.

depression,"-sorry, I did post this yesterday and got a couple responses but Reddit isn‚Äôt showing me those comments so I‚Äôm trying again- was really close friends with someone but when i moved away it became a long distance friendship. We were okay but then I noticed she would take days to text back, or constantly forget to text back in the middle of conversations. It did hurt me and I tried to bring it up a couple of times and she would sort say sorry then just do it again without ever explaining why. I tried to stream something with her a few times and gave her my app ID but she never added me back, yet would stream with our other friends. That really hurt me. recently told me she wasn‚Äôt doing well so wasn‚Äôt texting back so I told her that was fine, tried to be there for her and I told her I was there. I asked a couple times if she wanted to talk about anything on her mind and she avoided those messages so I dropped it too and we went back to texting normally (as in light hearted questions). One day in the middle of a conversation she just replied with ‚ÄúI‚Äôll reply later‚Äú so I was like cool. he left those messages on read for 2 months but in the meantime was posting on socials her and her friends hanging out, and was actively making plans to socialise with others (I saw because we‚Äôre in a group chat together). I know she was putting in effort to talk to others. That hurt me a lot. he eventually texted back but just kept starting random new conversations (like sending social media posts) without replying to or even acknowledging the messages she had ignored for 2 months. For me that was the last straw and I stopped replying to her altogether and have ignored her attempts to reach out (which again is just her starting random conversations, not actually acknowledging the situation). been a couple months since I spoke to her last and I have been really happy, my anxiety has gone down so much. But, I feel guilty. I feel like I abandoned her in a time of need. I hear people say all the time that depressed people withdraw but she wasn‚Äôt socially withdrawn from what I saw. he was withdrawn from me. Am I still in the wrong? And as mentioned earlier, I‚Äôve tried to talk to her about the distance between us, about how it feels when she doesn‚Äôt reply for days with no explanation, why should I bring it up once again?

And we are also on and off. o when I went to this dude‚Äôs house around 7 pm, his friend opened the door and btw I used to ‚Äúhang out‚Äù with his friend, but only a couple times and we never had sex. Anyways, the friend looked like he saw a ghost when he opened the door and I kinda just paused then slightly smirked and walked up the stairs to my hookup‚Äôs room. (I don‚Äôt know if they know that I dealt with both of them and at the same time). o when I got into his room, he hugged me then went downstairs, a couple times actually. When he came back he was acting different, distant. And also it was my bday last week and he didn‚Äôt wish me a happy bday but he texted me ‚Äúwyd‚Äù at like noon... so I went over kinda pissed &amp;amp;amp; I didn‚Äôt really speak to him and he didn‚Äôt sit next to me when he rolled up and when he sat next to me finally and we finished the joint, he put my hand down there..when we were sitting on the couch watching tv. He tried to basically rush into sex which, he doesn‚Äôt usually do. o we end up having great sex (I was more dominant and less connected) and at one point he‚Äôs behind me doing it, and then out of nowhere he‚Äôs in the bathroom peeing. I was shocked because I was still in position and he didn‚Äôt say anything before stopping, I‚Äôm not even sure if he finished. He stopped out of no where which has never happened to me before. I know he was enjoying the sex like I was (I even pulled out my vibrator). When he came back out, I asked if he was done and he said ‚Äúyeah‚Äù, he‚Äôs a total douche. Then I said ‚ÄúOh yeah I forgot, you‚Äôre a one rounder‚Äù and he said ‚Äú oh yeah‚Äù. Then I left. What I don‚Äôt understand is why his friend was over there and he had him open the door... he has never had someone over before when I come over, it‚Äôs like he didn‚Äôt care about discretion at all or he‚Äôs comfortable enough to with me at this point. And he pretty much treated me like an object that evening. We barely spoke to each other, because I was giving him the silent treatment but even when he came back in the room he really didn‚Äôt try to make conversation.

depression," I grew up a happy kid, and had a lot of friends. But when I was 14 my parents forced me to go to a private school that was 45 minutes away and it had long school hours compared to regular schools. I lost touch with my friends because of this. Then I kept switching schools in high school so I never really had a solid friend group. I was lonely, depressed, was battling my own demons, and on top of this my parents would constantly shit on me, I‚Äôve never been good enough for them. They‚Äôd always shit on me and mess with my self esteem, they were really controlling, it was almost as if they wanted me for themselves but they would constantly tear up my self esteem and just say negative things to me. I didn‚Äôt know how I felt back then but now I can look back and realize I probably went into depression and I think that was the root of my anxiety. Anytime my parents would even be near my room, I‚Äôd start feeling anxious, worried about what they‚Äôre going to shit on me for this time. I remember, I‚Äôd even be scared to go downstairs and get food because my dad would shit on me for being overweight but anytime I‚Äôd go on a diet, he‚Äôd complain saying that I just have to exercise and I don‚Äôt have to diet. As I got older, I turned this anxious feeling into aggression (without realizing it), whenever my parents would be around me, I‚Äôd feel so irritated by their presence (I still do) and if they had anything remarkably negative to say, I‚Äôd shut them up by being rude. Now I feel bad for being rude to them, I think I‚Äôve been emotionally blackmailed since I was a kid, because whenever my parents say something rude I‚Äôm supposed to just take it but if I say anything rude, it‚Äôs the end of the world and I'll feel guilty about it and I'll keep thinking of moments where I was rude to my parents and feel regret. My parents didn‚Äôt even let me go to the University I wanted to attend. I wanted to move away from home for a bit and go to a University that was a couple hours away from my hometown but my mom started crying when I told her about going to this University. he emotionally guilted me into staying and attended my local university which is way more difficult. o here I am now, haven‚Äôt graduated University, Don‚Äôt have friends, I feel as if I‚Äôm depressed and have anxiety, on top of this my parents are still shitting on me for ‚Äúnot doing anything with my life‚Äù.

Why are you saying this to me when you‚Äôve literally never let me make my own decisions, and now since you‚Äôve realized your plan failed, now you want to act as if you guys didn‚Äôt have anything to do with this, and just want me to be anything I want to be. I‚Äôm 23, I feel lost, empty, alone, angry, sad, to be honest I don‚Äôt even know how I feel anymore.

depression,"TW: substance abuse. Life is pretty shit for me sometimes, most of the time to be honest. I finished my DBT group, I‚Äôve become better, more in control of my emotions and better at being effective with communicating and less toxic, but I think it‚Äôs too late. It really doesn‚Äôt matter that if changed, it‚Äôs too late. Yeah, I talk to people, and even go out on dates, it‚Äôs not something I‚Äôve never had in my life, but it‚Äôs too late I feel. I don‚Äôt have the energy to fight anymore and have pushed away anyone worth fighting for. I‚Äôve become so depressed that not even opiates makes me feel better, and it‚Äôs not because of a tolerance, it‚Äôs just any remotely good feel is tainted by the fact that there‚Äôs nothing left.

depression,"Warning this is my opinion/experiences only, which means they can be debated blah blah blah and come to your own conclusions. A lot of this is going to be extremely controversial. People will always leave your life, you need to accept that.** something I've learned. No matter who you are, no matter if you're a good person, kind, boring, funny, people will always leave your life.  this can be your fault. Only you know your life. Maybe you are toxic and people are sick of it. But, a lot of the time it's not your fault. Life just pulls people in different directions. And people are not BAD because of this. It's just life. People do other things with their lives, previous friends you were ""besties"" with begin to branch out and make new friends, and you become less relevant to them. This doesn't make them bad people either, so do not become angry with people over this. may even feel like something is wrong with you because of it. There isn't. You're probably young and went to school/work with these people for a long time, and them suddenly leaving may be extremely shocking. This is a normal and hard part of life. It's okay to cut people out of your life.** know this sounds contradictory to lesson 1, but it's not and here's why: are transactional in some way. Whether it be emotionally or physically (money, experiences), they are transactional. And this isn't always a bad thing. For example there are 2 types of transactional relationships. Toxic and nontoxic. - only one party benefits. - both parties benefit from the relationship. toxic relationships, the friendship becomes one sided to the point where it can be actually start negatively affecting your mental health. And when that occurs, you need to make the choice to stay or leave. Neither of which will make you a bad person. ometimes people don't click, sometimes people can become toxic and become emotionally draining. you need to make that choice and it's dependent on your individual circumstances. Help others, but don't put their needs above yours.** I've found out from this is, it makes you look weak. And predatory people will try to take advantage of your ""kindness."" It's okay to say ""no."" However, you need to use ""no"" sparingly because if you say ""no"" too much, you'll look stuck up. But if you say ""yes"" too much, you'll look like you have no backbone. Equilibrium is the key to life, folks. help others because you can get a lot of benefit from helping others. Giving advice or donating a dollar to charity is going to help you feel good about yourself. It's a mutualistic relationship. You help another, you get a slight dopamine high from feeling good, everyone wins. Plus, they may be able to be your allies/friendships in the future. **Try not to care about what others think of you, because the truth is, no one is thinking about you as much as you think about you.** is a very big one for teenagers and young adults. Constantly, people are pressured into thinking about what others think about them. The truth is, you really need to understand this, at the end of the day, no one is thinking about you. are most likely thinking about themselves and their flaws, etc. a quote (that apparently isn't by Winston Churchill, but he is credited with having said it) ""When you‚Äôre 20, you care what everyone thinks, when you‚Äôre 40 you stop caring what everyone thinks, when you‚Äôre 60, you realize no one was ever thinking about you in the first place."" - Unknown. is true. **You need to be yourself, but be the part of yourself that fits the ""vibe.""** see this debated a lot, especially in deep communities like depressive communities. I've seen, ""Be yourself!"" and I've seen debates ""Don't be yourself, fake yourself"", etc. This is my opinion on this debate. yourself, but be the parts of yourself that fit the vibe you are in. requires situational awareness. For some people this is intuitive, for others, you need to learn from books/experience. the group you are in is professional (workplace, doctors, etc) you will probably want to be the ""professional"" version of yourself. Don't make crude jokes, don't be super casual. the group you are in is a friendship group, then figure out your role. Your role needs to be authentically yourself, but fits the social customs of the group. this is from former embarrassment, don't be the funny one if you do not fit that group's style of humor. You'll come across extremely cringey. (I have a dark sense of humor and I've been in groups where I've told a dark joke and the joke flat-lined because it wasn't that group's vibe.) Just stick to being the most comfortable version of you that fits the group. don't fake yourself. If you fake yourself you'll have to role-play the entire time you are with that group and it's a pain in the ass and they usually catch on pretty quickly. (I've done this too.) Don't rely on others for your happiness.** you do need some sort of human connection in life to be fullfilled, however, have others amplify your life, don't rely on them to make your life.  a lot of pressure to put on someone and honestly, it's a bit toxic. You will only have a few ""true"" friends in your life. The rest are situational/circumstantial.** gradeschool, you were friends because you were in close proximity. ame with work, most of those people are your friends because you're forced to be around them every day. I'm not saying these people are not your friends, I'm saying that their situational/circumstantial friends. The moment you leave your situation, they disappear too. [""true friend""]( will be there and have interests outside of those situations/circumstances. They won't leave your life because you are no longer in close proximity or in that situation, they won't become jealous over your successes and always want the best for you. friendships are rare, but that's what makes them extra special. I have one true frienship in my real life and am thankful every day for it. Don't let others define you.** so I know someone is going to go by my post history and find a possible contradiction in my thinking.  my thought process, they aren't defining me as ugly. They are pointing out something that is factual. I am genetically unappealing. lesson doesn't mean that though, this basically means, if someone says you can't do something,  try to do it anyway. If someone calls you stupid, you probably aren't. There are many people out there that are made to hurt others. I don't understand it, but they exist. ometimes people put others down because they are jealous, angry, envious, or some other emotion. They don't know you as well as you know you. And if you work smart enough, you can probably achieve most things. Think of everyone as a lesson to make you a more knowledgeable person.** person in your life, good, bad, and the ugly, is a lesson. ome people are people you don't ever want to be like. ome people may be people you want to aspire to be like. And some are simply those that can offer good advice. Everyone can have a purpose in your life if you give them one. I have many more ideas for these, but I'm going to be uploading them to my Youtube channel at some point. I have a youtube channel and a few people want to join it and tell their stories.

I am a 15-year-old, high school junior from the U. feel like I need a place to voice the opinions/thoughts I have been having. as I said before, I am both a teenager and a high-schooler, which are both known categories of general chaos in ones life. The worst thing though is that I have absolutely no friends to get through it all. All of my ""friends"" are completely fake -- basically, my middle school friend group was divided into 2 smaller groups in freshmen year, and I ended up being on the straddle of both groups. Needless to say, I am essentially removed from both groups at this point. I still sit with them at lunch, but they exclude me from everywhere they hang out, they keep me out of group chats, I have *never* been texted for anything outside of someone asking me for school help, and they emotionally hurt me by ignoring what I say and saying negative things to my face. also, for perspective, last year during virtual school, I didn't talk to a single person my age all year for stuff not related to school or activities -- ie, I have no friends. compensate for this, I decided to overload myself with insanely difficult classes, in hopes to distract myself from the lack of friends. For context, I am taking 6 AP classes (which are college level classes), which specifically are AP Calc BC (Calc 1 and 2), AP Physics C Mechanics (Kinematics), AP U Government, AP English Language, AP Microeconomics, and AP Macroeconomics. Most people in my school struggle with taking 1 or 2 AP classes, and many never take a single one, so needless to say, taking 6 of them has taken a toll on my mental state. Weekends are nonexistent for me due to the insane amount of work. here's the situation I am in now. I am insanely stressed and overworked by the crazy courseload from school, I have a ton of activities after school that take up the time not occupied by homework, and worst of all, I still have no friends to talk through it.

depression,"Where do i start? Its a lot for me to deal with and take in at the moment, but here goes.I (37m)have been in a relationship with my current gf (37f) for 7 years, we have a 2 yr old son. Recently we went on a vacation for three weeks where i planned on asking her to marry me.Well jsut before we left she had her phone left out and on a conversation with some guy.. well it wasn't great for our relationship thats for sure. Confronted her about it. Well i learned a lot that night about our issues and things that i didnt even know. I learned that i am an emotional abuser and a lot of things i was doing was pushing her away from me. We agreed to work on our issues and try to resolve them, save our relationship and find therapy and things like that. gf is on 3 different depression meds and i think partly due to stress in our relationship. Just for info purposes.  over the last month I have stipped doing anything and everything she said was an issue. Changed how i thought about a lot of the things she has said or asked of me. I've tried to focus my attention on doing things for her and making her feel appreciated and loved. Massages, flowers, dinners at home, time together, more open about things and plenty more. even started writing my thoughts about us and our relationship out so i could give it to her since I'm bad at it. There are still issues for us.There are some things she is doing that come off as not caring About what is going on. depression, anxiety,  and other issues.o I'm starting therapy this week for the first time ever. I want to work on figuring out why i was acting the way i was. From my depression,  to child hood abuse and neglect and stuff. My past experiences in general that have led me to be this negative person.  My family history of abuses as well as mental conditions in my family. am currently having a hard time, I'm depressed to the point ive called friends to talk for a few hours about our issues. I've sat here crying uncontrollably barely able to stop.. even in front of my son.. which i didnt want to do but couldn't help it.. having him come up to me and ask why I'm crying, and giving me a hug telling me it will be ok daddy... it just broke me more.I don't know how to handle all of this.. i will just keep working and all. Won't hurt myself or anything.. but I'm struggling to keep myself together every day right now. Idk if i need medication or not, but therapy will hopefully help and if i get reffered and gets meds i will take them.I'm just so worried that i might have been this horrible emotionally abusive person for so long that i won't be able to change myself enough, get the help i need in time to save our relationship.  If i can't then thats something else i will have to deal with that will make the depression even worse.In a months time frame i read 8 different self help, relationship,  or emotional abuser help books, booked therapy,  changed a lot of myself and how I act and treat her. I sit here thinking about what i say, how i do things, and how i should be different. if this is right place for all of this or not.

depression,"Yesterday I had a panic atack about my feelings of emptyness not getting any better while my body just gets objectively worse from aging and conditions. I couldn't handle waiting anyone. Then I calmed down, sorta. Had another panic attack. And another. And another. I used to only have panic attacks in specific scenarios now they're getting really common.  where were my councelors? Nowhere, because it was weekend. Did the crisis line help? Not at all, it's just some rando telling me to calm down and find a distraction. Asif I didn't try that. They don't even come in person. I had no one to rely on except for my mom, she's the only one that really cares. The moment there's no money involved, the proffesionals don't give a shit, and even if there is, they give pills that make my life permanently worse or say things that won't fix my problems anyway then disappear the moment it's out of schedule. what was I left with? Ranting to my friends about my problems. You know how people always say ""I'm always there if you need someone to talk to"" and ""never bottle up your feelings"", ""I wish my depressed friend opened up before they took their life"", well, following what they say never leads to anything good because my problems have only gotten worse over the years and many can't be fixed. It will just be a constant stream of samey negative rants and meltdowns and me dismissing any of their attempts at positivity because I know ot doesn't work while they sit there being unable to do anything about my desperate problems for the 500th time.  I do is make them feel worried, sad, powerless or flat out annoyed. Once they start to get to know me, the most common answers I get range from being ignored to saying they do know what to do but support me to saying I need to see a therapist (I've seen different ones for 10+ years). It doesn't help me while all I do is drag them down with me. people have their own problems to deal with. They don't have the time to deal with someone that basically becomes a leech of negativity or a toxic virus. They say they'll always be there for you, but realistically, they won't in the same way I'm not there to fly to a starving child in Africa and give all my money. There's only so much I can do while still living my own life and staying sane. They tell me they won't get sick of it. But then they do. This is all if it goes right btw. If nou can also open up and potentially be met with insulting responses or people trying to take advantage of you being open. I have two options. 1: pretend to be someone I'm not and bottle things up while feeling like they don't accept who I am or aren't willing to put up with who I really am. 2: Just outright isolate myself, the exact thing they tell me not to do. Well I'm doing the latter except for the handful of individuals who can actually seem to handle what gucked beyond belief person I really am..i'm sick of pretending or only making things worse for people.

depression,"I live in Central Victoria Australia.  Originally British.  Male, 55 years old.  Recently remarried. my life I have struggled with anxiety and depression.  I feel I am at near to my all-time low right now.  I have started again to have thoughts of suicide, these thoughts are becoming stronger.  It scares me now more than ever before because I see no way my life is going to improve any time soon. wife is pregnant with our first child.  The child will be my first ever, and this is the same for her.  We are both delighted with this.  I would and I already have done everything possible to provide for us and to make our family life as happy as possible. problem is I am trapped and being abused emotionally and financially.  ometimes I feel my wife is not as committed to me as I am to her and to our unborn child.  I would do anything for her.  But she can be very abusive to me when she does not get her way.  he does not work and never has worked at any time in our 9 year relationship.  I share a large proportion of my salary (25%) with her each month, with the remainder I pay for every part of our living costs myself.  Here I mean I pay absolutely everything.  I mean the mortgage, all bills, all groceries, all outings, all living costs, all incidentals.  he does not use the money I share with her at all for anything.  If she wants something, say for example clothes or cosmetics, she asks me to pay for it from my money and if I do not do so she becomes hostile, even violent, threatening to leave me and demanding divorce. the past year we have moved out of my tiny apartment into a small house and I have financed a new car.  In both cases the change was triggered by her demands that if I did not do this, she would leave me. we are here and within 3 months our baby will be born.  This will be an expensive change and I do not have any money saved to pay for the things we will need.  On top of that, even without the baby my monthly outgoings now exceed my income.  I buy almost nothing for myself.  I can't afford to continue to live as we are living.  Very soon I will need to start selling things in order to continue to pay bills.   But even this I know is not sustainable, very soon I will run out of things to sell and no further options to reorganise my borrowing and find more money to continue to pay for everything we need and everything she wants. week my wife asked me for something.  I can't even remember what it was, my mind has somehow blanked this out.  I remember telling her that she should buy things like this from the money I share with her each month.  he exploded into a rage, demanding divorce, followed by torrents of abuse and threats.  This continued through the night.  The next morning I was an emotional wreck.  I somehow got myself together and escaped the home, driving into town.  I was in uncontrollable terror, crying that I could not stop.  I called Lifeline, I did not know what else to do.  The lady at lifeline convinced me to go see my GP.  I saw him a few hours later, he later took me to the emergency CATT team at the local hospital.  Here I spent a couple of hours pouring it all out to the specialist.  Eventually I summoned enough strength to go home.    wife greeted me with hostility at first.  Angry and violent threats.  I pleaded with her to calm down, begged her to understand that I was just unable to handle the situation alone, that I needed to go find anyone who could help me.   I did not dare mention money again. have calmed down at home but I am still very broken inside.  I wake up in the middle of the night, 3-4am usually, feeling massive panic.  I have to get up to stop myself descending into tears.  Often I do anyway.  The CATT specialist issued me with some Valium - this seems to help stop me bursting into tears, but they only issued me with a supply enough to last a week.  I do have some Mirtazapine which helps me sleep through the night.  Of course none of this helps with the true causes of my anxiety. feel this is only going to get worse.  My wife will not relent on her financial demands from me.  I feel if I tried to explain how dire my finances have become she will simply blame it all on me and become nasty to me again.  he will either leave me taking our unborn child with her or make life truly unbearable for me at home with her abuse.  Either way I feel it is pushing me closer and closer into despair, I fear I may drop so low that I will collapse or take my own life. really am stuck, still looking for ways I can manage my way through this.  Right now I feel I am emotionally afloat but I know it can take only one small thing to push me under again.I have rarely been this low. I don't know what to do.",1635130070,4714,906

depression,"I really thought I made it out. I though I finally got myself to a good place after a really dark 2020. I should have known better. had a really intense depressive episode may 2020. uicidal intense. It was terrifying and mortifying and I feel intense shame about it to this day. It taught me a lot about who I can depend on to be there for me when the chips are down, and the answer was no one. My mom and sister both made themselves the victim when I reached out for help. My boyfriend was just a deer I'm the headlights. No one came to comfort me. No one tried to help me.  never made a real attempt, I got through it. Alone. Like I always have to. My boyfriend watching terrified from the sidelines, hoping it would just go away. signed myself up for betterhelp. The counselor I got was immediately out of her depth. he looked terrified as I explained my problems. he quickly launched into CYA mode, asking me the canned questions to reduce her legal liability. I didn't want to get involuntarily committed, so I had to reverse course and lie to assure her I was fine. No help there. tried a psychiatrist. I was very careful about how I presented my problems this time. kirting around the dark parts, downplaying the severity. They didn't probe. They didn't care. But at least they gave me meds. meds helped, I wasn't imminently suicidal anymore. Just back to the casual, passive kind I've been so well aquatinted with for years. And everyone else went back to normal, pretending it didn't happen. No one checked in, no one offered to talk. No one even offered an empty ""if you ever need anything, I'm here."" On my own, like always. gradually got better. I shoved my feeling deep down inside and let everyone get on with their lives. Then in November my boyfriend decided he wanted to transfer jobs. Across the country. It seemed exciting. A new opportunity, exciting adventure. Put some distance between me and the dark stuff. And my job was remote, no problems there.  I sold my house, we packed up and we were moved by February. And I was excited! It was an adjustment, not completely smooth sailing but overall positive. I started biking and exercising a little more. Reconnected with a couple friends online. I went to an ADHD clinic and got a diagnosis and a prescription and things really took off for me! the first time in years I was feeling ambitious. Confident. I was losing weight, getting fit, and getting my laundry and dishes done regularly like a normal person! at work had been rocky so I decided with my newfound confidence it was time for a new job. I started interviewing. It was stressful but exciting. It moved quickly. In retrospect, far too quickly. I had doubts, there were some alarm bells in my head about it. But with 30 years of being told my feelings are wrong under my belt, I easily rationalized that away.  accepted the offer and quit my job. I was so excited and proud of myself! Oh the hubris. What a fool I am. hate it. I hate it for all the reasons I thought I would. I knew I would. It kicked me from top of the world straight back into the pit. And I have no one to blame but myself. I fucked everything up. the confidence is gone. The energy is gone. The self-destructive, reckless behavior and suicidal thoughts are back.  relationship is crumbling. I think I want it to end, but I can't trust anything I think or feel anymore. It could be a trick, a trap set by part of my brain I don't understand. thought of going back to that job tomorrow makes me nauseous. I want to quit. But it could be a trick. It could be a trap. I don't know what I want or need. I can't tell what's good for me anymore. think I'm really broken now and I don't see a way out. And I'm alone. And no one will help me. I could disappear right now and of the billions of people on this earth only two would even notice or care. My boyfriend and our roommate. Because they live here. And they'll be fine, because they spend all their time together anyway. They're basically a couple and I'm just their roommate that pays all the rent for them. what's the point? What do I keep going for if every time I pick myself up I get mule kicked back down? Who am I doing this for? I don't think I have it in me to do it again. don't worry.

depression,"Well throughout my life I had many reasons to be suicidal but right now the thing that wins the whole top is university. I have anxiety (even now as I write this) and dread thoughts whenever I think of it and it's a big part of my daily life, it's too overwhelming. I don't feel like I can do it anymore, I'm seriously thinking to give up but I'm forced to continue because of my abusive parents. I hate everyhting about it. always buried in homeworks and I constatnly receive abuse from teachers. Last week I made a post on here where I explained how I was made to cry the third time by a teacher because she treats me like the worst thing in the whole universe - she put me to answer and just when I opened my mouth to say something she put someone else to answer and it's not the first time happening. I'm constantly ignored and pushed aside. Of course she also has favorites and she and her favorites constantly kiss each others ass. have many severe teachers that don't care we are people with a life, outside the university one, with feelings and desires and needs and just bury us in homeworks. Every week I need to translate 10-15 pages (that's just one homework out of 6 I think) full of non sensical, outdated foreign language. week something embarassing happened, I stayed up the whole night to catch a class that starts at 8 am because I can't wake up too early anymore. I caught the class but somewhere in the middle I fell asleep and woke up many hours after. I want to mention I have classes online on Zoom. I'm death scared to enter in that class anymore. of this fucked me up even more. I'm tired of all the abuse I received throughout this wonderful ''educational'' system that this shithole has. Not to mention the abuse I received outside of it. I'm not tolerating further abuse. University should have been a rational environment full of professional and polite people, not an abusive cesspool. don't really believe in therapy but whether I get to finish this shit or not I'm really fucking considering it because all these things really affected me. I write I feel a strong impulse to not enter in any class anymore and never participate in exams and wait until summer and take up other languages or just take up history.

depression,"This sounds so stupid‚Ä¶ Anyway, my mum recently asked me to take my dog for a walk - which I was more than happy to do - but I took a rather long time to prepare myself which she was really pissed off about. suffer a lot with depression, which I never really felt supported by family regarding the ‚Äòmental health‚Äô department. Well, for the past month I have been falling into really bad habits again (waking up at 2pm, watching tv all day, binge eating, etc‚Ä¶) and on the 30th day of the month I decided to wake up earlier, make my bed, clean room (I know this sounds like normal expected responsibilities but I struggle to do ‚Äòsimple‚Äô tasks, on a day to day basis).  mum started getting impatient with me after her constant nagging for me to take my dog out, which I understand that I was taking a long time. As I was putting my shoes on, getting ready to take him out, she storms into my room lays on my bed, refuses to leave, then starts ripping off my sheets, ripping down photos on my wall, throwing things around in my room (this really upset because I felt like that day was a fresh start).  stupidly decided to yank her off my bed. I attempt to get her out of my room (I don‚Äôt like it when people invade my personal space). But she won‚Äôt leave my room - at this point I refused to take my dog out, because I don‚Äôt like being told what to do.  don‚Äôt know what overcame me but I shoved her really hard in attempt to push her out of my room (I really understand that this was wrong of me). I felt rage after she ruined my room, so I went to her wardrobe and started tearing everything down. ended up back next to each other, and I don‚Äôt know who initiated it but I just remembered her yanking my hair so I did the same, we were kicking each other, and then some point she ended up on the floor. Again, I don‚Äôt know what overcame me but when she was on the floor I punched her really hard on the back repeatedly and kicked her really hard repeatedly.  on, I rushed off to my bathroom, hysterically crying. I had a really bad panic attack which led to me attacking my arm with scissors (I usually H when I‚Äôm overwhelmed). I felt so awful and ashamed so I took a lot of paracetamol - hoping that I would die (it obviously didn‚Äôt work).  just feel so guilty and ashamed. I hope that the aggression within me will never resurface. I keep replaying the event in my mind and can‚Äôt deal with the guilt, it‚Äôs killing me. My mum and I have already forgiven each other. But this constant sensation of guilt is so overwhelming. I know I deserve this state of mind, but at some point I need to learn, forgive and hopefully let go. I can‚Äôt be tormented by this shame and regret forever. Please help. I really need advice on how to move on and grow. I don‚Äôt know if this is relevant, but when I was around 13 - my mum and I were doing maths homework (maths isn‚Äôt my specialty) and I just couldn‚Äôt get this one equation. My mum then randomly starts punching me really hard in my head, multiple times, over a maths problem??? Then to top it off, chucks a wine glass in my face. - This left an emotional mark (I don‚Äôt know why). My mum and I never addressed it. There was also this one particular incident with my dad around a year ago (I was 15), we had an argument just after I woke up - I was still in bed - (for some reason I decided to sleep naked). Anyway, my dad screamed at me to get out of bed, but I refused because of obvious reasons. He got so angry he dug his knee into my stomach, got onto of me (he‚Äôs 6ft‚Äô6), put his hand around my throat, hit me across the face multiple times, and I screamed at him telling him I couldn‚Äôt breathe. anytime had passed, he kicked me out the house (with no shoes), threw my shoes at me aggressively. I called my other family members in shock (as it was rare for my family to be physical) yet it was never addressed again after. I return home, my dad yanks me by my arms across the floor then goes on to scream at me some more, telling me: I‚Äôm a ‚Äúdisappointment‚Äù and that my mental health issues are ‚Äúfake‚Äù. statement really left a mark. My family know that I have struggled with depression and anxiety for pretty much my whole life. I also have issues with trust and sharing my feelings - they‚Äôre very much aware of this, as they encourage me to share more with the family. My dads comment was inspired by my evil step mum who despises my siblings and I, as well as my mum, whom she‚Äôs never met before.I felt my feelings were really invalidated by that remark, it really hurt. family really love each other.

I had a big knee surgery and got on some pretty strong pain meds, my family has a history of addiction and I was deathly afraid I was gonna get addicted to them ( idk if this needs to be in here but it's so background info for you ig). The pain, the meds, the fear of addiction, and being incredibly behind on school all made me go into a really bad place that thankfully I'm not in anymore. But I've never really gone back to how I was before the surgery, I've been so anxious ( of course bc of covid but also a lot of other things too)  since then and I have dreaded going out with friends and seeing other people in general. Anything that's not me being alone and in my house makes me drained before I have even done said thing. I don't wanna talk to my friends anymore or do anything I used to like doing. Even when I'm alone and comfortable I'm still feel hollow, like I could just stare blankly at a wall for hours and be fine. Any and all motivation feels like it's been ripped out of me. And I feel so lonely but I want to be alone like?? I want someone to talk to about this but anytime I do I feel like such a burden and melodramatic ( hence the Reddit post + throw away).

And even if everyone understood or we made up something to explain the cancellation, I would still feel like such a shitty friend. I mean idk when I'll ever want to hang out but it's obvious that they really want to, and it feels like I'll have to coat everything in a thin promise of "" one day soon we can get together"" to not hurt their feelings. I didn't mean for this to get so long so  I feel really empty, tired, alone and drained all the time, especially when I have plans.

I deal with depression, really bad anxiety and ptsd from past bipolar behavior of wife‚Äôs. And I have slowly come to the realization that I am miserable in my life. Currently my wife is dealing with a lot. he is in clinicals and works full time, so she is basically at work 6-7 days a week and is only home from 1030-5 the next morning most days. On top of this she is between psychiatrists and is struggling with her medication and bipolar. he is trying her best, but what this all means is she‚Äôs not very present at the moment. This means if I‚Äôm not at work, I‚Äôm taking care of the kids and house. When I do have free time, which is rare, I have literally no current hobbies that actually bring me joy. I like gaming with my friend who is basically my brother, as outside of texting, this is the only time we get together. But he has a 6 month old and , so by the time the kids are asleep it‚Äôs usually too late. And even when it‚Äôs not, we mostly play fps or other competitive games, which end up making me more angry than truly being enjoyable. Along with no hobbies that are truly enjoyable, I am not close with my kids, in part because I‚Äôm still learning how to parent, only been around for 5 years, to teenagers, and in part because my depression makes it hard to just get off the couch most days. Add to that taking care of a toddler and it doesn‚Äôt leave a lot of room to really bond with them.

My son is the only thing that truly makes me happy and I feel as if I‚Äôm letting him down too Bc my depression makes it hard to want to be more active and playful with him.

Ever since I was little I was always on my toes around him, because the smallest thing could set him off. One time he tried to help me with this part of a pc game I couldn't figure out on my own, he got so angry he broke the cd in half. People, specially my relatives that watched me grow up, must wonder why I'm so weird, why I cant look people in the eye, why I always look uncomfortable around them, why I can't talk to others like most people do and why I'm so painfully shy like I was since I was a child. If they knew what kind of environment I grew up in. ago when I was in college, he travelled a lot for work and often arrived late nights on saturday or after midnight on sunday. I always woke up with him muttering complaints to himself, slamming doors and throwing things around in the kitchen. To this day I feel like I'm in a constant state of worry where I don't know what's the next thing that will make him angry, I'm never completely at ease. He's worried about my current state since I've been hiding since graduating college nearly 5 years ago, havent worked or had any social life since, so he's been even worst than usual. He's rude, spends every day watching conservative podcasts on youtube, and when he's not watching those he's muttering complaints to himself. As I type this he's downstairs doing exactly that. And then he asks why we have drifted apart even more during the pandemic, that we don't spend any time together as a family. I wonder why. I said I'd like to make a little something for lunch, to go along with whatever he had planned. He was immediately against it, said that particular recipe had nothing to do with lunch, but bought what I needed anyway. Today as I prepared this, he was preparing something else and forgot it on the pan, which caused it to burn. When he noticed that he got angry, threw the burned food in the trash and begun slamming doors and complaining. At one point when he slammed a cabinet door behind me, It startled me so much I jumped. I havent felt like that since I was a child.  guess its on me that I'm a looser who can't even do the most basic tasks and has to live with his parents at 25, nearly 26. But I feel like I'm about to burst at his next scene. The next time he starts slamming things I want so badly to open the cabinet with glass cups and just shove everything to the ground and scream that I can't stand this anymore.

I've been trying doing the things I love like being with friends, working, doing math and playing instruments. Nothing motivates me anymore. been trying relationships aswell, but right now it feels like some sick prank is being pulled on me. I know it might sound like I say I'm not the problem, but hear me out. I'm going to tell you about the last girls I have been talking to.  first one I met about two years ago and I was new to the friendgroup. he made me feel welcome and was the one who braided me into the group. he's kind and considerate and wouldn't hurt a bug. After about 6 months I caught feelings for her and confessed them when our mutual friends bugged me to. he said she had to think about it. I didn't recieve an answer for 6 months. When I did recieve my answer it stated: ""I can't go into a relationship"".  was heartbroken and couldn't stand to meet her or our mutual friends for months. Luckily I had just started highschool and had a few friends there I could hang out with instead. When I started meeting her again after a few months she confessed how she had sucicidal thoughts and depression. How she couldn't go to the doctor because then she'd feel like the depression was real. I didn't know what to say. I hadn't tried to meet anyone new and my feelings for her kinda just stuck with me, so hearing this after months of not seeing her made me feel terrible, like I had abondoned her when she really needed me. of our mutual friends also said she was really twofaced and unclear in what she wanted. It all made me sick and I forced myself to move on. Later that year I met this girl who was a lot more popular than me, but we hit it off great. For a few months we had just been friends, but then she confessed her feelings for me. I hadn't had time to think about it and I left her hanging, which made me feel terrible. I never really saw her as anything more than a friend. I have been catching feelings for her and I've been flirting with her a bit. Today she got the news that she only has a short time to live due to a heartproblem. I may sound really selfish but what did I do to deserve this. What can I do to move forward. How can I get better from this. I can't go out anymore. I can't live my life like this. I don't want my life to be pathetic, but right now I don't see any other way out than to end it. help me.Struggling with motivation",1635118128,2479,482
depression,"I joined the group very recently. In fact today. I've come back to it on a few occations but never had the courage or the forethought to post anything until now. I have battled with depression since I was a kid. I've had family issues, self imagie issues and have had problems socialy since the beggining. I was a loser with only a handful of friends in school and when I moved onto college nothing really improved I was socially akward and kept to myself even though I lonnged for a valuable friendship. I have one good friend from high school and a few friends that I met online. We have all grown up and have our own busy lives.  shouldn't feel lonely I know this. I have a husband and two beautiful little girls. But I feel like I have lacked a connection with someone who understands what I'm going through.  reach out to people and it hurts to get no response. I know that everyone has their own things going on but I have been in a really downward spiral since I had my last daughter in March. I've reached out to friends and sometimes I don't get a response for days...weeks even. On my lowest moments I call and the worst feeling is when you dont get someone to answer the phone. I stopped reaching out because it hurts more when you dont get a response.  have so much to unpack. My therapist for lack of a better word kinda isnt helpful. I had the same one for years until I moved then I transfered care to my new location and loved the new one but she quit and found someone new after I had my daughter but she and I dont do well together and honestly I am to scared to break ties with her so I feel like I'm not really getting the help I need.  hard feeling so alone even when your not. I feel like I'm being ungrateful for what I have but I CANT shake this feeling. I want a meaningul connection and for the pain to go away.Feeling Alone",1635118124,1850,358

depression,"Maybe that's why it's so easy for me to fall asleep lol, I can't wait. Its so comforting...  like a lottery ticket, maybe I'll get an aneurysm or a heart attack in my sleep? can hope! It's exciting stuff night!When I go to sleep I like to pretend I'm dying",1635117985,256,50
depression,"i cannot talk about it otherwise i will crack and feel like i will never return to myself. last time i almost talked about it i had a breakdown, sobbing, snot running everywhere, muttering random things, stripping my clothes, body shuddering. thankfully i was alone before i broke down after i almost talked about it so i did not get embarrassed. never again. i do not know what will happen if it happens again, i will probably die. do not want to kill myself since that would be illogical, but i feel trapped as a result. forced my way into this world without a way out that would not lack integrity, so i pursue regardless, maybe because i am human.cant speak about it otherwise ill crack, not with anyone even strangers even. i talk about it i will probably die",1635117924,764,140
depression,"Hi, I am 20yrs and I have been living in absolute pain since my early high school life.  I was a kid I felt happy, comfortable, I had such ambition and the idea of me wanting to live my life to the fullest but as I approached my teen age years I developed severe chronic pain in my jaw and neck and it was not a sports injury rather something genetic from my mom‚Äôs side of the family. Also to mention that when I was born with heart issues that led me to nearly losing 70% of my sight in my right eye and 60%of my hearing in my right ear. I also came with a weak kidney.  almost all that did not matter until three years ago, I moved to the states with my family in 2016 and I struggled in high school not because of English being my second language it‚Äôs because studying was hard for me, i would try like all the time but eventually I passed.Then college can and I did not know what to do, I did not feel a motivated to study anything and most of the things I wanted to and study where at higher colleges, my dad although he works hard and provides for us could not put me into a good college since he could not afford it, so we decided that I go to community college which was going great but up until two years  ago I got tinnitus, I do not know how I got it but it‚Äôs the worst thing that ever happened to me, I had to take sometime off and deal with it, I could not focus or work, I developed anxiety, I distanced my self from others and my studying got more harder. feel talentless, worthless and rejected. I know that every body has got issues to deal and I do understand that but I feel like what I am dealing with is non-stoping like I am never gonna leave this cycle. I tried a lot of things and although I stick with them I just suck at them. From art to cooking to doing anything that can prove that I am worth something and that I am not on this earth just to suffer but nothing came out of it.  really have family problems, I know it‚Äôs a very common thing but I feel as my family are so toxic and emotionally detached from each other I am just hating myself more and more, but I try to stay hungry and try and push on more and more. am just sick of seeing others live their lives while I feel like the reject and the unsuccessful of them all.I feel useless",1635117901,2269,457
depression,"I‚Äôve been having a horrible episode the last couple of weeks, coming to a climax last Thursday when I relapsed. But yesterday I felt fine? Like not good good, but ok at least? It was so strange and it felt kinda invalidating too, like all the struggling I did was gone just like that. My though patterns were still the same though and I still cried a lot when I tried to sleep, like I have for the past couple of days.  I felt worse again, but still not horrible. I feel lighter in my head but the same in my body as I have for the past weeks. My head feels like white static, like I‚Äôve been up for way too long. It feels so strange, I don‚Äôt know how I feel. I can feel really bad for an hour and kinda fine the next. It feels as if I‚Äôm either doing so bad that I‚Äôve blocked out my emotions completely or that I‚Äôm magically cured.  guess I‚Äôll know for sure how I feel by tomorrow, when I have to go to school again.I feel off",1635117741,925,187
depression,Don't you think the ppl who make life harder for those who suffer also deserve to die. I do...so when the day comes when I decide I've finally had enough I'll take those exact ppl w me. Bc they deserve it...life's painful as is yet you insist on adding more and more just for you own sick amusements. don't feel the pain anymore just memories and a clear determination to put an end to they're lives..I'd like to think that's actually my purpose for beingSure I deserve to die but,1635117557,480,90
depression,Is there any honest advice for how to even challenge this beast that is depression. I have suffered from it majority of my life and I feel like it‚Äôs been worse this time around. I have things in my life I should feel grateful for but all I do is isolate and stay in my head 24/7. I‚Äôve tried therapy and I‚Äôm tired of venting to someone and them just asking me ‚Äúhow it made me feel.‚Äù I wish I could be normal and achieve all my goals but instead depression takes away all my energy of hope to strive to be something. Why do we have to suffer like thisWill it ever get better?,1635117522,573,115
