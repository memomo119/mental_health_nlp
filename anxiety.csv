Anxiety,"I have a lot of things that trigger my anxiety to varying degrees. ome of them are harsh, some are small, some of them make sense, some of them would seem inconsequential to anyone else. I'm writing down all the weird triggers I can think of. Things that would seem weird or bizarre to freak out around, but make me do so nevertheless. What do you guys think? Do you feel the same for any of these triggers? Have any of your own? Let me know down in the comments! Advertisements, especially ones for job sites like Indeed, because corporate life sounds awful and job hunting is terrifying.- Anything with parents and kids, even if it's a video of a cat with a kitten, because it makes me think about having children and having to take care of them and that's terrifying.- Characters in stories (TV, movies, comics, etc.) that are socially competent or sexually experienced, because it reminds me of my own social and sexual inadequacies.- ad stories, because I get scared that my life will be a sad story. might be adding to this list with edits.

Anxiety,"What kind of physical symptoms do you experience? To me they started manifesting a month and a half ago. I have always been an anxious person, and I used to drink a lot of caffeine, and one day I felt that tingling sensation in my tongue and hands, and then I got dizzy, and then I freaked out and my heart began to race. I really panicked and went to see my parents, who reassured me that caffeine can do that. I slept fine that night. It happened the next day as well, but less intensely, and the day after, and when it was Friday, I felt the brain zaps or shivers, and that made my anxiety worse, until one day I simply had to leave work early because of my constant worry making these symptoms show up more often.  began taking Valerian root, after a doctor told me it was a somatization of anxiety. That reassured me, and the brain shivers stopped altogether and were replaced by a mild dizziness that came and went. There was a steady improvement until one day I got freaked out by what I think was an ectopic heartbeat. I began to constantly monitor my heart at that point. Then I made an appointment with my doctor, and that night I also had to leave work early, as the palpitations were freaking me out. o I decided to ask my mom to take me to ER. They did an EKG, measured my pulse, it was elevated (as I was panicking) but it was normal (high but not showing abnormalities). The PA did blood tests, which were all normal, and sent me home. At the doctor, I reported my anxiety, and I got a physical, blood tests, etc, and came out fine as well. They prescribed Lexapro. The first week in Lexapro, especially the first few days, were horrible. Constantly worrying about my heart, constantly checking the HR on the fitbit, until I had to leave the fitbit behind as every time the HR went over 100 I would freak out, wishing it to go below that number and thus increasing it, causing the cycle to repeat. Eventually, things levelled out, and now I think about my heart less often. Palpitations happen less often, but when they do they still disconcert me. This past week I have been sleeping fine, I feel less anxious at work. At the beginning, it was always a battle: wanting to leave work, but knowing I had to stay. Now I am fine and can cope reasonably well. It has been 3 weeks on Lexapro, and I can't wait to see the full effects. I haven't been dizzy in a few days either, which bothered me a lot as I felt as if I was in space or something. Plus it worried me as I think I have health anxiety. What have your experiences with physical symptoms been like? Have you experienced brain shivers, even without medications? What about heart palps? How do you cope with these? Tomorrow I see my doc again, and I want to report my progress and get more reassurance.Anxiety physical Symptoms",1635428166,2797,526

Anxiety,"I had anxiety for more than 5 years now. I managed to lower my anxiety a lot for some period of times, but it always come back.4 months ago, I ended my 3 year relationship with my boyfriend. I ended it because of my low self esteem and the constant doubts I had. I wasn’t happy even though I love him more than anything in the world. Three weeks after that I told him I wanted us to go back together. I believe he is my soulmate and the love of my life. But he didn’t want to. ince then, we stayed friends, but I’m still madly in love with him. I suffer everyday. I wake up from nightmares, imagining him with other girls. I have panic attacks because of this thought. It breaks my heart that he doesn’t want me anymore. He moved on so easily, and I’m still struggling like if it was the first day. I can’t imagine a life without him. And I’m tired of everyone saying there are other fishes in the sea. This kind of connexion, if you are older, you know it doesn’t happen often in life. I’m still young, but I don’t see a future anymore. I’ve lost my envy to live. I wouldn’t mind being dead now. My dream was always to build a home, have a family with the man I love, and now, everything seems impossible. I spend my days thinking about him and trying not to cry in public. I try so hard to move on, but I can’t. I saw this quote recently and it hit hard “what if you were the one, but I wasn’t ?” I wish I could do things to keep my mind busy. I would love to go on a solo trip. But my anxiety keeps me from doing that. If I’m alone, far from home, even 1 hour from home, I panic. I feel like I’m stuck. tuck in the middle of a foggy, dark ocean, looking for a lighthouse.I don’t have a lot of friends, I’m an introvert and I don’t really like social interactions too often. I don’t talk to a lot of people, and I honestly don’t wanna talk to anyone. I feel alone and misunderstood.

Anxiety,"It started for me maybe two months ago where I felt like a radiating wave of tension starting behind the ears, down the spine then out on the toes. I don't really know how to explain it that well since it's not the usual muscle tension I've felt before. my head it's like I'm hyperaware of the signals in my nerves and spinal chord. But it very well be something like microtension in the muscles. on the anxiety I feel the radiating sensation varies in intensity as well. A lot of anxiety equals strong waves, less anxiety = weaker waves. During an attack like I had yesterday they were quite intense with maybe 15 seconds between each wave. As the attack settles and I become calm they subside and get spaced out even more. also feel them randomly during the day like tics or a reminder of my anxiety. don't use any medication. else felt this or knows what I'm talking about?

Anxiety,My anxiety has gotten worse lately and it's completely wreaked my sleeping patterns. I haven't been able to fall asleep during the night for like 2 weeks now. I eventually crash in the morning and fall asleep. I wake up at some point during the daytime and maybe do a couple things before I get tired and my anxiety tells me go back to sleep avoid doing scary things and feeling.

Anxiety,"Growing up, I watched my parents struggle mentally and financially. It put a real damper on my experiences as a kid. As I got older, I lived in fear of falling into the same patterns as my parents. I promised myself that I WILL do better. I WILL be financially stable. I WILL be mentally stable.  24 now, and I've switched jobs roughly 8 times (I've lost count at this point), and the experience at each job was pretty much the same - The first year or two are good, and I get amazing feedback from my employer, then something happens. I get overwhelmed with the work load and/or office drama. I shut down and become overly sensitive to everything. Crying becomes I consistent pattern. I always want to throw up. My heart beats way faster than it should for nearly the entire shift, and in regards to fight or flight, I flee the first chance I get. I've struggled with mental illness for a long time, but respect my employers enough to cleanly cut off the job. Profusely apologizing to my employers for my recent performance, having no explaination for it, and then leaving. One moment I'm thriving, the next, I let too many things fall through the cracks and I crumble. One moment employers are singing my praises, then one year later, they're threatening to write me up.  never talk about mental illness at work - To the people I'm generally around, it comes off as I'm being lazy. They roll their eyes and tell me, ""Really? You have to give me a better excuse than that."" But it's true. I was diagnosed with a couple mental disorders that affect me on a daily basis, including how long I keep my job.  I'm only 24, I feel like I have set myself up for failure by never making any commitments. Dropping out of school and leaving my jobs.  does it become your fault that I can't think, sleep, eat and breath? It this my fault? Am I doing it to myself? The amount of money I bring in defines me and who I am. It defines how valuable I am as a person. It becomes my identity. Who am I, if not a contributing member to society? What kind of person am I if I'm not working? I beat myself up about it a lot.  is my last day at my current job, and my heart is breaking.  like to emphasis the intensity of the issue by giving a little background. My boundries were crossed at nearly every job. I understand that will be consistent throughout every job I have. There are toxic people everywhere. There was trauma from every job I had that contributed to my choice to leave - exual harassment, verbal abuse, a hostile work environment and just general tension from a particular coworker or groups of coworkers. The common denominator is me, so surely I am the problem, right? urely I'm expecting too much, my boundries are too wide, and I'm setting myself and everyone else up for failure. There were times, even way before I was old enough to work, where my life was at danger by my own hands. Telling myself that I might not see the sun again tomorrow. It's sad. Pathetic really. Not on anyone else's end but simply my own. What am I doing wrong? insight is much appreciated.Can't Keep a Job for More Than 2 years. Here's why...",1635420278,3122,580

Anxiety,"Heya, so around 3 days ago my father told me I am getting kicked out of the house. The situation is not first time for me, but usually he just screamed that he will but n he ever said it to my face.. 2 days ago he said it to my face. Long story and all it sucks I am still in school and now he just ignores me or mumbles stuff. It's hard to get ignored all day after coming in from school.  Around 8 hours of my life irl I am talking with no one.  It's only me and him in the house.  But the stuff that I can't to ask her for advice is that after this threat, I just wake up in weird hours like 4 am or 3:24. It really ruins it for me. I just can't go back to sleep after that, my heartbeats so fast and I feel so energetic,  every sound in the house I hear  it all..  did someone experience that? How did it stop?

Anxiety,"**Hello, I'm new here! It's a pleasure to join this community!** a few months ago, I woke up during the night out of the blue with a feeling of pure terror, dissociation, loneliness, nervousness and anxiety, sweating and with an uncomfortable, rising sensation in my chest (no shortness of breath, no pain, after a few seconds I fully realised it wasn't real).  At the time, I spoke to my therapist, who said there was a high probability that it was a nocturnal anxiety attack. For months it didn't happen again, but this month has been mentally draining and I've been having ""anxiety attacks"" almost every day, even more than one per day.Yes, I put it in quotes because I don't really understand what it is and my psychologist characterises it as an ""anxiety attack"".  But I don't really understand if this is an anxiety attack or a panic attack....And I know that attacks are different from person to person, but mine are weird to the point where I can't explain it well enough or be believed.  have looked at websites, posts, blogs on the subject but I couldn't find anything that resembled it, so... I thought maybe the Reddit community could help me (I realised how varied Reddit was through the youtube channel NEXPO- thanks NEXPO!). o I'll try to describe the attacks.All the, the rest all happened while I was awake and wide awake) daytime attacks happen like this (I only had those 2 that happened at night waking up from dreams (literally)): of nowhere, my mind is completely consumed by the recollection of a dream I ""had"" (I put it in quotes because I actually have the feeling I know those dreams but don't remember dreaming them- it's important to point out that what triggers this memory are usually trivial things, like objects, people, places..there's nothing important about them, they're super mundane and normal things!) and I suddenly go into a complete state of dissociation for seconds. My whole body goes numb, I feel hot flashes all over my body but localised at the same time...I get nauseous and have the urge to vomit (nothing coming out, obviously), I feel a rising feeling of anxiety/nervousness going up through my stomach, passing through my chest and stopping in the throat area, and I feel a slight tachycardia. Remember I mentioned the hot flashes?Well, while this happens all over my body, there is an area where I LITERALLY feel heat radiating from there, which corresponds to the pelvic area and genital organs... it even seems that suddenly I lose control of that whole area and fluid starts coming out (I confirmed and it's just a sensation).  All this happens at the same time and lasts for seconds. What I've been doing to stop it is taking deep breaths through my mouth/nose and saying orally ""this isn't real, it's in your head"", which always works.And after I calm down, I stay in a mild state of dissociation for minutes/hours, memory gets cloudy and I always get a headache (which sometimes reaches migraine status). week I haven't had any attacks yet, but between last aturday and unday I had about 6. I'm not desperate about the situation, it's my body saying ""you have to take it easy because everything gets done"", and I know that. What brings me to despair is no one helping me to understand what this is, do these characteristics of attacks happen to anyone else and what type of attack this is. I am hoping that someone in the community has gone through or is going through a similar situation (and I send lots of love and positive energies because ""life is a raindrop"" and whatever is putting you in this state is only temporary!) and can enlighten me a bit about this situation. good vibes and have a dreadful good weekend hehe !Yes, I put it in quotes because I don't really understand what it is and my psychologist characterises it as an ""anxiety attack"".

He knew I needed to go but couldn’t leave because my car keys were in the bag. As soon as I found it, I had to walk out because I started to shake and feel the upset build up inside me. I fought back the tears until I got close to my car and then had a huge meltdown and cried uncontrollably all the way to nursery. I couldn’t get my breathe. I am still teary now and it happened yesterday afternoon. still don’t know why I had such a strong reaction and I don’t know how I’m going to cope when I go back in tomorrow. Part of me wants to just ignore him forever because I can’t forgive people who mentally torture me, but I hate confrontation and know if he speaks to me I won’t be able to show I’m not happy. I wish I could be stronger and stop being afraid of confrontation. My partner wants me to report him to the supervisor (who was there when it all happened), but I can’t prove it was him who did it. I don’t know what to do or how to feel. I don’t want him to think it’s ok to carry on with stuff like that. a couple of weeks ago, I went into work with a white vest top on and he soaked me in this wash station thing we have. They kept making jokes prior to that about wet T-shirt competitions and when I asked him if that’s why he did it, he said it was an accident but was smirking again. A workmate told me to report him, but again, I have no proof. The supervisor was present when that happened too. have just moved into a new department because my anxiety caused so many issues in the last department.

Does anybody have a tips for coping with this or anything to help me feel better.

I was  also drunk pretty much the whole time and out of it but not a complaint or sad feeling at all. Abnormal burst of energy, my parents were worried I would be my usual crabby self (I don't do well in car rides longer than 4 hours) My last car ride was 12 hours a couple of years ago and I had a huge meltdown apparently - but I don't remember this at all (my parents told me) so hearing I would be driving 9 hours in a car for five days of drinking was worrisome but I hate taking my meds and drinking because of the major blackout from the combo so I just went cold turkey for five days and hoped for the best when I got home. yes stupid but I needed a fun weekend so don't lecture or be rude. I thought a rest day would be fine and I laid in bed from 8 pm to 8 am and missed my shadow hours at the hospital because I was exhausted finally from the long weekend. I had been waiting for it to hit me any minute now but I actually slept terribly bc my heat in my house decided to go out and the temperature was now moist and 45degrees. I woke up around 9 am and couldn't fall back to sleep so I got up bc why not see if I can be productive and get my things together for the week. I took my Vyvanse (prescribed 40mg) in the morning after I got up. My sertraline is taken at night, so I had to wait until 8 pm and thought my Vyvanse could get me a little more back to reality/get it together time. I felt hazy though, slow, experienced expected brain zaps, smoked to ease them and it helped. tarted typing my paper due later that night and felt my heart palpitating, I finish around 230am and it feels like it should be 2 pm. I get home and bring my stuff upstairs and notice my heart is beating really fast and look in the mirror to see if I'm losing any color and if ill faint, but notice my pupils dilated like my color was about to vanish. I check them in the direct light and they barely get smaller. I noticed my hands twitching and shaking and my feet are numb. My jaw almost feels as if I'm coming up on molly before the worst part and it's just kinda numb? I am talking and reacting in a frantic matter bc I can't tell if I'm freaking myself out or I should go to the ER but I also have class tomorrow that I am so behind in because of my new meds and adjusting properly on top of my parasomnia disorder for night terrors every single night where I scream and talk in my sleep so much that my brain activity doesn't allow me to properly rest.....so I'm literally always tired. I don't know the last time I woke up refreshed, except kinda for this weekend and it was very odd and unusual for me and how I've been in the past (not on the meds then) but anyway, so I take my pulse and its at 206bpm at rest (i was sitting) so I lay down and it goes to (197 bpm) and I notice my heart pounding out of my chest so I am a little freaked out basically and yes clearly have a wild case of issues which isn't even all of it but this is all over the place bc my mind is racing so pls read and lmk if you relate, have related, what u think, etc Idk ughweird stuff going on with me, relatable anyone? 21 yr F who never grew out of her nightterros",1635413015,3299,675

Anxiety,"(36 M) Been anxious for the past 6 months. It usually comes in periods. I didn't really have anxiety since 2015. It came back in July and it's hard to figure out why. I'm starting to realize that the underlying causes can be related to suppressed anger and general stress related to aging/life slowly passing by/decaying of the body/fear of finding a meaning to this life.  I'm just sitting and thinking about life, time, space, and the fact that we're existing on a planet, and suddenly my understanding of this situation changes, it becomes more clear and integrated for a second or two, and it's really scary. It's deranging, it's mind-boggling... a terrifying lucid thought. We could be anything: a glitch, a simulation, God's creation, a random event, a surrealistic nightmare.  you people preoccupied by this ? I think most of the time we just take this life for granted, we see it as it is, just a sequence of daily problem-solving basically... but I think pondering about it makes my anxiety worse. Gosh I wish I never started scratching on the surface of the concept of existence... it's becoming unbearable.Anxiety macro-triggers",1635408021,1139,192
Anxiety,"I was afraid to go to sleep, not afraid of sleeping, but afraid of going to sleep.

I would assume I passed out but something was always out of place making me feel like I did something in my sleep that I don't remember. After smoking this doesn't really happen, and I used to have lots of breakdowns, now those don't happen a lot either. But I feel guilty and dirty, I'm only 19 and not in college yet so i really feel the societal eyes on me. Like I'm smoking my brain away or lazy.

And when I had the opportunity to get myself some new clothes on a family trip I ended up getting a bomber jacket which I’ve always just liked the look of but never once dreamed of using in public.

Anxiety,"Hey guys,  I'll be moving back to the city after spending around 2 months of lockdown with my family out in the country. I have a small room in a nice apartment building with 3 other room-mates who are all strangers to me. have lived out of home for 5 years now, but that has either been with friends or a girlfriend/friends. I'm now feeling incredibly anxious. I have a very small social circle and having gone from a comfortable life living with my ex gf to living alone and having nothing to do with my time (university finishes this week and I'm working once a week until I find another job) the prospect is incredibly daunting. the back of my head I know ill be fine. if I need to I can drive out to see my family, ill be able to hang around with my friend on the weekends occasionally, and I've made a vow to myself to get out there and be social where possible. however I am a very introverted person and have lived most of my life doing introverted, solo hobbies/on my own. I don't make friends easily and have little dating experience. think what I'm most anxious about is all the alone time in a foreign environment. it's very easy living with family as its a safe environment for me but living alone is very daunting.  know the answer to this is time and building a routine for myself. I'll be going to the gym 6 days a week to fill time and hopefully find work eventually but weekends are a very lonely, sad time for me at the minute and being in a city where people are going out all around me while I have nothing to do tends to bum me out like nothing else.  I'm just sort of rambling but it helps to get my thoughts out into the world ya know.Beginning to live with strangers and small social circle/no close (proximity) family",1635398622,1743,332
Anxiety,"Now this post is a long one, but hopefully worth the read. I think it would be good to show this to someone who has never been through health anxiety, and wants to know what it’s like. I am from the UK, so I talk a lot about going through anxiety here. o particularly anyone from the UK suffering what I’m going through, show this to your loved ones. Also, I’m here with you on this.  am going through one of the worst things I have ever experienced, anxiety. It is, without a doubt, the worst thing I have ever experienced.  There has been an uprising in help for people with mental health issues and they are extremely common, so you do get help and support with them. However, I don’t believe people truly understand the dreadfulness it brings to someone’s life. To truly understand how bad my anxiety is, or just how bad anxiety is for anyone, I have to tell you where it all started.  was diagnosed with an autoimmune condition last year, the inflammation causes a lot of brain fog and fatigue which I believe led to the start of my anxiety. But anxiety and health anxiety can start from a range of a different reasons. The anxiety itself causes a lot of physical symptoms. Which has led to severe health anxiety. Ever since then, it’s just got worse and worse. The physical symptoms are the worst thing I have ever been through. Extremely bad Indigestion, heart palpitations (which worry’s me about heart attacks), extreme fatigue, brain fog, dizziness, headaches, numbness in the arms and legs (which worry’s me about strokes). The indigestion is awful as it makes me feel as though I’m having a heart attack. ometimes, I can feel my oesophagus cramping up. This has led me to have a number of ambulances and A&amp;E trips. All for them to just say it’s anxiety. I had only been to A&amp;E once before all this, when I broke my arm. I had no idea that mental illness could cause so much. What amazes me, is that you could read about the symptoms of a condition on google, worry about it for a short while, and then experience them!  I never used to really understand what it meant when someone had psychosomatic symptoms, until I went through them myself. They are as real as any other ailment. They are as damaging as any other health condition. They carry on occurring, even when you’ve had day or two of not feeling too anxious. This leads you to trying to find out what’s wrong, which is an extremely hard task and only serves to make the symptoms worse by Googling what’s wrong or not being able to get a doctors appointment.  from the UK, it is EXTREMELY hard to get a doctors appointment, and even when you do, you have to make sure you tell them EVERYTHING. Otherwise, if you miss something, you have to try again. Then once all that is over, and your lucky enough to get to the hospital to see a specialist, the wait is usually months, even if it’s serious, like cardiology or something. That’s just for an APPOINTMENT with a specialist, They then have to book you in for the relevant tests for a diagnosis, which you then have to wait months for. All the while your anxiety is growing stronger each day. I would dread to be from the U and have to pay for all this. Although, They are probably seen quicker.  used to think that people with health anxiety were ‘crazy’ people who just wanted to be at the hospital all the time or something. But it’s not that at all, it’s real, scary, awful physical symptoms with no diagnosis. I genuinely believe that anyone in that situation would react the same. Health anxiety makes you question your mortality. It forces you into an existential crisis and a cycle of symptoms that can make you believe it’s genuinely your last day on earth. I cannot put into words how scary this is. It is the most mentally challanging aspect of the whole ordeal. Due to these reasons, I am unable to function. I cannot work. I’m emotionally and physically debilitated. I have never been through anything this bad. I cannot afford to not go to work. But I can’t physically do what I need to do at work. I need financial help while I fight these issues at the source.  financial stress adds more fuel to the fire. I have rent to pay, and without work I have no money to pay it. Universal credit offers such a small amount compared to my rent it is unbelievable. They accidentally paid me too much last month so they are even asking me for money! (I’m on a zero hour contract, which is why I still claim from UC. Which I first started claiming when the second lockdown hit and I lost my job) Then you have PIP, which offers a small amount and it’s extremely hard to get with mental health issues. If you apply for pip, You’ll have an interview with someone and you are scored ‘points’ based on how bad they think your illness is. But the questions are along the lines of “can you use a knife and fork on your own?”, “can you climb stairs on your own?” and “can you get dressed on your own?” etc... I completely understand that there are people out there that need this, and I hate to sound entitled, but what about the people who can function at a basic level, yet struggle to work? hould those people be left to fend for themselves, no doubt making their symptoms 100x worse?  I feel good, I love work. I love making friends at work, keeping myself occupied, earning money etc... working is rewarding, I enjoy it, Or at least I enjoyed it, before the anxiety started. Now it’s an incredibly challenging effort to fight my inner demons, while making sure I’m serving someone a vodka and coke correctly without having a panic attack from the chest pain, or to not pass out from the extreme dizziness. I used to be good at work, people would be happy to hire me and would respect me as a good worker. Now, every 30 seconds I’m fighting the urge to sit outside and wait out the physical or mental symptom I’m enduring.

Which is heartbreaking.  am yet to see a therapist, as I’m on a waiting list.

Anxiety,"My bf and I have been dating a bit over 3 months. As soon as we became more intimate and grew closer, I realised that he has anxiety (though no diagnosed disorder). I am an anxious person too but I think I am better at controlling it than him. Recently he has been having anxiety attacks with tears and self-hate and I am the one to help him through them almost everyday or once every 2 days, constantly giving the same reassurance. I am becoming tired of it, almost like it's an endless circle, but I also feel guilty, since he is always there to help with my anxiety. His bad moods often pass onto me, even if I'm feeling okay or happy.  have been having thoughts about breaking up with him - but I find them silly, since it is like running away from the issue. I love him and want to have a future with him. Is there anything I can do to help him and myself to go through this challenge?my boyfriend has anxiety and it's making me worry about our future",1635397381,956,185
Anxiety,"My anxiety was so bad for the short period of time that I was unmedicated. It was fine at first but it just progressively got worse. I was feeling things like dizziness, lightheaded, nausea.. and I couldn't be still, I had to be constantly moving, whether it was just rocking in a chair or bouncing my leg, I had to be moving. Even in vehicles, if I came to a stop I immediately felt lightheaded. I'm on zoloft now and it got better for a little bit but I wasn't quite there yet. My doctor told me to go ahead and raise my dosage, and now I've gotten worse again. I'm hoping it's just side effects, but that aside, has anyone else dealt with similar things? I'm starting to wonder if it's something else that could be wrong.Has anyone else felt like this?",1635396908,755,143
Anxiety,Hi everyone! If this question is better fit for another sub just let me know.  some background: I don’t have an official diagnosis of ocd intrusive thoughts but it’s about the best explanation to what I experience. I think I have always had intrusive thoughts but it started getting pretty bad around early 2019. From then on they have fluctuated in severity and as of now (for the most part) they don’t have too much hold on me. However there are a few that still trigger me and will kinda send me into a spiral of panic. When I’m in this state my thoughts are repetitive and I can’t calm myself down easily. These specific ones are typically situational or have to be triggered by something. I guess what I’m saying is my intrusive thoughts can cause severe physical anxiety/ panic attacks for a couple mins to a couple hours.  in relation to my question I was wondering if anyone has experience taking beta blockers for this type of anxiety? I know most ppl who use blockers for anxiety use it for social/ performance anxiety so I wanted to see if anyone in here has used them for reasons like my situation? I wouldn’t use them everyday only in situations where I know I’ll either become  panicked or during an actual panic attack? I would prefer to not take any harder anxiety meds so I thought this could maybe be a better alternative? (Also yes I know I should talk to my doctor but I’m 20 w no health insurance so I wanted to see other peoples experience before having to pay out of pocket). I can get more in depth but I don’t want to bore y’all so if you have any further questions lmk!Has anyone taken beta blockers (propanol) for ocd/ intrusive thoughts?,1635396125,1665,305

Anxiety,"I keep re-opening old wounds. Wounds that I had thought that I had let scar over, wounds that frankly I had for a good amount of time forgot even existed. Wounds I am quite honestly too ashamed and embarrassed of speaking of. I basically don't even remember what it is like to live without anxiety nowadays unless I'm high or drunk. Even when I'm with others it's gnawing at me.  don't even have any new things to cause me anxiety, but because I've basically conditioned myself into this state every morning I think of a wound to re-open, and pick the scars off and let it hurt fresh all over again. It's just a subconscious habit at this point, not even something I can control. I can't control my own thoughts, feeling like a prisoner in my own head. If I don't even have possession over my own thoughts, then who am ""I"" really? Who is ""me""????All I seem to do is re-open old wounds",1635395726,884,165
Anxiety,"Back in ummer 2017 I worked at this summer camp.

Fast forward later we was throwing water from water bottles at each other nothing to serious but then my other co worker noticed some water got on him and his phone, keep in mind he's like twice my size so he's pretty big. I told him it was accident which he should know because I wasn't the only one throwing water. He didn't buy it so he took my phone and throw it across the room, it was too embarrassing, I thought about attacking him but he's already twice my size and he probably would've done worse.  His phone was still working too  make my day even worse when I started walking home from work another co worker was mocking me by walking behind me.

Anxiety,"Is been almost 12 hours since I almost got in a car accident and my anxiety hasn't gone any better. Even though I know this things happens all the time I just can't stop thinking about it. I crossed a two way road without seeing one of the sides. There was so much traffic and was really hard to get in. When I finally decided to pressed the gas I saw a car in the other direction comming towards me, I was already half way so I just had to pressed the gas even harder to get in the lane. I got bipped and the the car stopped after almost hitting me  but I just keeped driving. I didn't know what to do in that moment, I was so scared that I was gonna get yelled at and the traffic was moving so I just leave. I had to parked some blocks ahead to cry and call my mom. I am a new driver (since August) and never have experience this before. The scene just keep playing in my head over and over but what I am more mad about is that I didn't say checked on the other car. I know so many people that are really violent when something like that happens to them so I just freaked out. It was a 30 mph street and I am pretty sure the person didn't stopped until after I passed him so that made me even more scared. Like, the only reason you are stopping is to tell me something. I just want to cry but the few people I have as support think that I am making a big deal about it, to take this as a lesson, etc. I just needed to vent here and hopefully having some support comments from people to understand the stress I am feeling right now.Almost got in a car accident and can't stop thinking about it",1635394910,1594,324

Anxiety,"This is something that has been on my mind for a very long time. I’ve (F29) never attended therapy so never had a chance to ask a professional for their opinion. But I’m curious and maybe someone has an explanation. Here’s my story… suffered from major social anxiety from a young age. I still remember a few situations where I threw tantrums at the age of 4-5 and up. Obviously I don’t remember exactly how I felt at the time and what the triggers were. But I always wondered why little kids suffer from anxiety if they hadn’t been exposed to anything traumatic.  I was a bit older, I was very shy and quiet. My family always said it’s because I’m an only child and I wouldn’t be this way if I had siblings.  one of my first social anxiety memories is when my parents tried to put me on a school bus with other neighborhood kids (my age) when I was in junior kindergarten. There’s even a picture of me getting off the bus biting my nails. And while I was at school, I’d never eat lunch or socialize with other kids. I would cry and the teacher had to call my parents. ometimes my mom or dad had to sit out in the hallway all day while I was in class.  really puzzles me is that a lot of other kids that were my age didn’t have more siblings yet, so technically they were only children at the time being but no one acted the way I did. Kids would just naturally start socializing and playing.  lasted for a couple more years until I started grade 1 and my parents said they wouldn’t sit in the hallway anymore. I guess somewhere along the line it got better. do you think causes/triggers such anxiety in young children? Like age 4…Anxiety at a very young age",1635391064,1658,316

Anxiety,"Hi. I count myself grateful that i haven't been on here on 6 months, but just now i had a passing thought, reminding me of my severe anxiety period i went through back in May/June. It came out of nowhere, i started getting panic attacks for no reason, feeling like i was going to die every time one came along. These panic attacks were accompanied by constant, almost indescribable feelings of terror and anxiety, that stayed with me, and tortured me every moment i was awake. I remember periods of just bursting out into tears, and my chest hurt from my constant muscle shaking and panic attacks. My head also felt numb from all the anxiety, and i just felt in general detached from everything around me, my anxiety had utterly consumed me, i thought this was it for me, my life will never be the same again, just agony and torture. The rest of my life was just going to be this perpetual cycle of panic attacks, extreme dread, and feelings of hopelessness. It really is impossible to describe to someone who hasn't been through it, just how terrifying and consuming it is.  i'm here to tell you right now, it isn't going to be this way forever, no matter how bleak the future looks. I'm living proof that it can and will get better, and you will enjoy things in life once again, it just takes time. Focus on things that bring you any semblance of calm or peace, and hang onto it for dear life. Try your best to avoid anything that even begins to trigger anxious emotions and thoughts. My anxiety period was so severe it gave me tinnitus, which is another battle i've had to fight as soon as i was getting over my anxiety to an extent. I've had my ups and downs, and moments of real sorrow and hopelessness, but i can honestly say that 6 months on, even though my tinnitus is there, and i get moments of slight anxiety every now and then, i'm honestly enjoying the things in life that i love once again. I scrolled through this sub during those bleak days, looking for comfort and help, and many did reach out, and offer advice that immeasurably helped me. One day too, you'll be looking back at this period, thinking about how terrible it was, and maybe even helping people who are in the same position that you used to be in.

Plus it was it was always ME who ended up driving us around or picking him up from work and I even offered to cover some of his meals when he was unemployed.

Understanding and recognizing the symptoms helped, but then I started getting heart palpitations and occasional chest pains. Again you begin to second guess yourself, but considering all the CT scans and cardiology tests showed nothing serious, I just assumed anxiety again. Not fun, but reassuring. forward to a week ago. I started experiencing heartburn type symptoms, discomfort in my esophagus and stomach after eating, acid reflux, etc. I wouldn't classify it as pain, but more a discomfort. A CT scan over the summer revealed a tiny hiatal hernia, but almost every opinion I got (even from my doctor) said not to worry about it. is all new to me. I thought the digestive issues could possibly be the hernia...but could it be anxiety manifesting itself in another way? Has anyone experienced digestive issues? Truth be told, there *is* something right now that stressing me out and taking up my headspace. It's a coincidence these shitty digestive issues popped up around the same time these thought's starting preoccupying my mind. Any feedback would be appreciated.

Anxiety,I grew up with adoptive parents. And my adoptive father always treated me really bad. I wasn’t allowed to sit on the couch because he told me I was dirty. When I visit them he yells at me when I for example use a pencil of them because he says I only use them… when I was 12 he told me I order expensive drinks (coke instead of water) at restaurants to provoke him.  adoptive mother is actually really nice and they also  have arguments all the time. But my adoptive mother is a really understanding person. However i figured out that I am so much better since I almost stopped contact completely. But if I do it I know that I will feel really lonely because I don’t have anybody else. I have 3 siblings. 2 sisters. and a brother who is also adopted.  My brother always treaded me in a really bad way and he is criminal now. My sister is really nice to me. But the other one has always ignored how our father treated me and even yelled at me - but  only to me never to him - when I responded to his insults. One time when she was drunk she told me that she never said something because she was worried that he will also tread her like this. (He would never have done this. Maybe she would have lost her princess status) Now when I visit them everyone pretends that there has never been a problem. I want to stop the contact. But I think I will break the heart of my mother and I don’t want this. And then I have nobody. What should I do in an emergency? It would also feel crazy not to go there on Christmas and inviting only my mother to my flat. I would feel really crazy like the black sheep of the familyI want to stop contact with my family but then I have nobody ä. What should I do,1635381290,1688,335

And I just was like YE THANK GOD YOU KNOW and she let me have a break and sit down and do breathing exercises with her. Just a full 180° of what she's usually like.

Anxiety,"I am 17 and I have really bad anxiety and today I had an anxiety or panic attack (idk the difference) and i thought that I was going to die. I have had this around 4 times in my life and today I was so scared I was going to have a heart attack or my heart would stop. I have been sick lately and something has been in my throat and I have been scared but then I just started freaking out and I start shaking and crying. Reading this now makes me want to laugh bc it sounds so dumb lmao. Anyways I honestly just needed support and the whole day I was telling my mom I was scared. My mom is an incredibly manipulative mother and she only gives me affection strategically and when it benefits her. Anytime I am vulnerable or just even sad she will ignore me and be mad at me. Today I was freaking out but trying to remain calm and she got pissed at me, which made it worse, she was slamming doors and things and it honestly fucks me up. My dad is the only person who I can talk to and I love him and he will sit with me and calm me down and tell me I’m okay. Well he was going to work but right before he left he let me check my pulse and then he talked to me and gave me encouraging words. My mom on the other hand, was yelling at me to calm down. Then she got pissed off when I couldn’t so she went upstairs. Then three hours later after I was calm, I went upstairs to my mom and asked what she was doing and, you’ll never guess, she was MAD. Because I had a PANIC attack. I can never please her and I am so so lost. Then I asked her why she was mad when she was the one that ignored me and that was cold with me when I needed her most. Then she was like “I don’t wanna argue” when she loves to argue any other time when the responsibility is not placed on her. o, I went downstairs, and like ten minutes later I heard her and my brother talking and she was CRYING. Because she cannot live one second of her life not being the victim. I hate speaking about my mom like this because I truly love her but my life has been fucking held down by her and my brother so many times. He’s the perfect child and he kisses her ass. o idk wtf to do anymore because I can’t even have one day. Today was traumatizing enough and now it’s even worse. I know I’ll never hear the end of this and I know that I will be the problem when we talk about it and it will be my fault because my mom was crying for no fucking reason. I honestly am not happy with my life because things like this happen all of the time. I usually just try to pray and stay on my own but I have been starting to think that it is not worth it anymore. Please, if you have ANY advice on how to deal with this in a healthy way, comment. (I have to live here until I turn 18 in August and I need suggestions to help me get through until then.)

Anxiety,"Okay so I have had like 3 panic attacks at my University with 2 of them leading to hyperventilation syndrome (hands, feet, and abdomen clamping/tingling). I've never had severe anxiety or even an ounce of depression until I got to college. I'm like 2 hours away from my University from my house and I have been taking a bus back-and-forth twice a week because I can't stand sleeping there. I have a bus ride tomorrow that is 2 1/2 hours, and I'm worried because my latest bus ride last week unexpectedly ended with me having anxiety, hyperventilation, hands clamp, bus emergency stopping, me getting checked out by ambulance. I do not want that to happen again. Mind you I did NOT know that my hands clamping was due to me hyperventilating and breathing improperly, I thought it was like low blood sugar or something else. Now I kind of know I need to breathe normally, still not sure **how** ""normal"".  basically, I would like to know if anyone can help me with some tips, maybe something to do to keep my mind off of panic? (Btw for some reason movies stress me out on bus rides, so idek what to do). Or if I **do** get a panic attack, especially in a trapped place like a bus, what should I do?

Anxiety,"In my opinion, there is nothing, absolutely nothing worse than the feeling of nausea during an anxious episode. The feeling of deep, heavy dread hurts to even think about. It slowly takes over your body until it feels like nausea is running through your veins. It's the signal for the start of the attack. in this moment where you will think about every single little you regret in your life while you desperately search for a way to pass this horrible feeling in your stomach, but the only way for it to pass is to wait. you're stressed about something, you feel it in your gut, when you feel it in your gut, you get even more stressed, leading to an endless battle between your brain and your gut to see who can inflict the most suffering. is absolutely nothing worse and every time I experience it I pray to God to let it pass, even though I have never been religious.

Anxiety,"I am usually a mellow individual, but there are times, and it can appear very suddenly, when I just have extremely violent, intrusive thoughts, often helped if they are triggered by some irritability.  Now of course, at the tender age of 22, which is where I sit, one's testosterone is at its peak level, and can of course contribute to say aggression. But I do get some severely violent intentions at times.  The other day I was walking in the street and another rather rough-looking guy (about my age), deliberately barged into me, and whilst I continued walking on, a wave of extreme, bitter violent anger engulfed me and for the next 10 mins, the only thing I could think of was beating him to a pulp and stomping his skull to mush on a curbside.   No joking it took me 10 mins for that to completely leave my head and thinking about it occasionally now, that moment still irritates me, and brings up these physical thoughts in my head.  Not my finest trait I must admit, and it does seem to be severe, but this is probs part of a wider manifestation of having an extremely short, shitty temper, that runs rampant in my family tree on my dad's side.

Anxiety,"To begin, I haven't flown much in my life. I flew a few times in the late 90s and very early 00s, again in 2014, then in 2020. I'm going to Rome in just under two weeks. is something I struggle with, even if it's something I've done hundreds of times in my life, like calling someone. For some reason I wasn't too anxious during my 2014 flight, but last year's was pretty unbearable. I remember gripping the seat as if I could hold the plane up. I remember not even feeling like I could answer my mother who was sitting next to me without disturbing some sort of balance. Even when listening to music I would actually pause in order to be more attentive to whatever the plane was doing, as if the music itself was too loud or erratic... I know this is ridiculous. I think it must be a combination of the strange environment and the odd feeling of being up in the air. I've never liked the way planes sound and move, all the bleeps and bumps. It reminds me too much of *certain types of films and images.*  I never understand why people appeal to statistics. aying something like, ""Oh, there's a 1 in a million chance,"" seems odd to me because I could be that one in a million. I don't care how unlikely it is. It's almost a nonsense statement to me. It could be 1 in a trillion and it'd make no difference. In the novel and incredibly rare event of going up into the air in a plane, my mind will always think of it as being something destined to go wrong. That's what ramps up my anxiety the most, this idea that something could happen at *any* moment. And I have images and scenarios in my head that go along with this.  do I get past this? I wish I could just believe in the statistics, sit in my chair and relax. It's so frustrating. I've been thinking of writing a list of everything that can go wrong in day to day life, from car crashes to being stabbed.

Minor anxiety has happened before, so I did what I normally do and I took an extra quarter of a pill (.125 mg).  ame thing the next day and so on for a couple of weeks.  till had anxiety…almost feelings of withdrawal.   finally broke down and called my Doc office.  After explaining to the nurse the situation, she called in Accord Clonazapam for me.  Been back on Accord for a couple weeks.   till had anxiety and feelings of withdrawal.

I always wanted to travel a lot and I find that when I'm travelling alone I feel confident and cool and like I'm conquering my fears.o this summer I decided to come to Germany to study the language and work, and maybe make this my new home. And I really thought this was what I needed not to feel so down about my life. Now I'm here, actually in a very isolated place, and haven't made any friends and because I'm alone all the time I figured that I actually have really bad anxiety. I don't go into shops or cafés by myself. Going to the supermarket is a nightmare. I avoid my boss and colleagues. I'm constantly imagining myself getting hurt or dying.

Anxiety,"so after school I went to do this activity with my basketball team, and I showed up pretty late and there was no where to sit. I panicked and walked straight out of the room . I felt a huge wave of anxiety and had to cool down somewhere. I sat by a lake on my campus and just cooled down. Later I had to see them again for team study hall and it went well and was calm. What I learned is that anxiety is very up and down. It can spike for one moment and then be low as can be for another. I think the more we dwell on “I hate the way I am” “anxiety never goes away” “why do I feel this way all the time” it’s just us in the moment not thinking right because of the wave of anxiety.

Anxiety,"Hey guys. o I have an anxiety disorder (OCD), and am generally much better in my day to day life than I was 5 years ago. Which is really good. Overall I am happy in my life and in the progress I’ve made to get to where I am. I finally feel like a functional human being. I started a new job around 6 months ago and things have been going well. Anyway, at work today I had a minor altercation in which I called out a colleague on something wrong which they shouldn’t have done, and they know they shouldn’t have done, but the dude is literally a man child so we ended up in a bit of an argument. When the argument started I felt an initial wave of anxiety, like adrenaline I guess and felt the blood rush to my head. I made my point though and didn’t back down as in my conscious brain I WAN’T nervous about the situation. It wasn’t a big deal and I know it was not something to think about or get nervous about, but I felt as if my body had different ideas as I felt adrenaline/anxiety quite severely afterwards. To the point where my hands were shaking a little. Why does this shit happen? Like I don’t give a fuck about the argument, so why does my body react in such an extreme way? I felt embarrassed as it was distressing to me that I had such a profound reaction from something so little, and again something me as a person doesn’t give a shit about. Does anyone else get this?

Anxiety,"Went to my family doctor to get medication for my performance anxiety. I described my symptoms and my doctor prescribed me daily 25mg metroprolol and some Xanax as needed.

I described this all to my doctor and he still insisted that I still take it daily. I was hoping to get a beta blocker that I take as needed, but the doctor said that I shouldn’t do that. know this is just reddit, but I need some personal experiences. I know I should trust me doctor, but it’s just a family doctor so I’m not really sure how experienced they are in these kinds of things. hould I take the beta blocker as needed or should I listen to my doctor and take it daily?Do I really have to take a beta blocker every day for performance anxiety?",1635366763,861,161

No, there is nothing that happens during the afternoon to trigger me, it comes randomly always found this very weird, but i reasoned maybe its because it takes time for the tension to build up inside my body so the effects come late in the day, because im inevitably expecting it to happen so of course it happens.

Anxiety,I had an evening event from work today and it was an complet disaster. First I apparently was to late because no one told me I needed to be there earlier. Then I couldn't do the things I was supposed to because my boss just did them out of nowhere. Then we needed to talk to the guests that where there and my social anxiety just got so much out of hand that I nearly threw up and breathed so heavily I was glad I still could stand normal. I also was glad that I had a mask on or people would have noticed that I was terrified of the situation.  a while I then just got to a group of people and there talked and I could sometimes say something to. In the end I talked to my coworkers and my boss and we got to the topic adhd in children (I work as a kindergarden teacher) and I said just without thinking that I have it and that I understand children that have it too and my boss acted afterwards very weird towards me.  know I have half of a panic attack with a pushi in my hand trying not to shake and convince myself that everything is alright but that doesn't work right know....I fucked up at work...,1635364064,1105,221

Anxiety,"Hi There I have been experiencing anxiety during my official meetings. My work is OK and yet i feel anxious during meetings. I specifically have anxiety in certain situations. It is more prominent in my standups and sprint planning - meetings where i have already panic attacks before. It started about 2 years back - i was gymming continuously and felt that i was very anxious the next day when i had a heavy workout.I started feeling anxiety while speaking in my standup meetings. Then one day a colleague pointed out why i was going breathless in meeting.It kind of started building from then on. history. :Pre-2020I was having uneasy feelings after eating food. o i went to a doctor and he thought i had GERD. After seeing dark circles around my eyes, he suggested i go have see a gastroenterologist. o i did.I had fatty liver. Doctor said its nothing to worry about, so i didn’t think much of it.  I had jaundice as a child, but that was probably due to weak liver. I have yearly full body diagnosis - nothing is out of blue except for slight bilirubin increase - which isexplained by fatty liver. I had panic attacks sometimes in flight also. But flights don’t trouble me anymore.2020For my anxiety situation, i sought help with a therapist. I worked out all things she recommended - keeping a thought journal etc but it didn’t help me much.I suspected that i have adrenal issues. I had a ct done of my abdomen and there were no abnormalities noticed. Then i suspected i had some parasites which werecausing nutritional imbalance in my body. I had an endoscopy doneI also have this strange twitching in my hands. I bought apple watch around 2 years ago and i was shocked to find i had a very low resting heart rate - 42bpm.I am not a pro athlete, so i consulted doctors who ruled out any serious condition after doing holter, ecg etc.2021Recently i had a fracture in my left leg and i underwent a surgery. Pre and post surgery, i had drips. I noticed that i was very calm during the daysi was in the hospital. I read that hypokalemia can cause muscle twitches, cramping (which i have almost daily and after masturbating). I think this might be it. did genetic testing and it ruled out bipolar, schizophrenia, crohn and cushing susceptibility. I sleep properly but have irregular bowel movements. I had covid last year and i feel slightly cognitively diminished after that. I have improved, but feel i can’t focus for long. I have also noticed myself using lot of negative words in self talk and self thought. I can’t seem to think straight and deep for stretch. history : Grandfather had cataract and asthma. He died of heart attack this year only. My grandma also passed away due to a brain haemorrhage. My father also has this, but he has never openly admitted this. I don’t know more than this.No serious illnesses like Cancer, diabetes etc in family. Pschosomatic POV : I have had online consultations with doctors who suggested that my illness had reached a psychosomatic threshold.I have noticed that i am having negative thoughts about dying etc all day. Even if its like a baby crossing a road, i tend to visualizean accident scenario, then and there. The therapist had also pointed that i was catastrophising and over generalizing situations that were causing me to be anxious so much. am in a high paying job and my work requires me to be high performant. Due to my illness, i have been embarrassed many times. I sometimes feel worthless and feel i should just give up. I don’t wish this illness upon my enemies. Please help my guys.Situational Anxiety",1635363745,3568,631

Anxiety,"Hey everyone kind of new here, so last night I was with my wife and we went out to dinner with some friends so I asked before we went out will this be an indoor dinner and we thought yes.  arriving at the restaurant I realized that it was on the 2nd floor balcony facing outside at night which for me is a triple trigger. space,  check.   Night sky, check. Heights? Check.  I unfortunately had a bad anxiety attack and couldn't hide it or cope well and probably ruined the night for my wife's friends, I was biting my lip and scratching my legs intensely and looking down the whole time and grabbing on to the table and the chair because of this intense sensation of panic and almost like a feeling of fainting and dizzy like I am going to pass out or gravity will reverse itself and I will fall into the void of the open sky. know how that sounds, illogical and ridiculous because you can't fall up and it's never going to happen but my anxiety is extremely illogical. I don't have at least 4 walls around me and a canopy or a hat on I freak out and have anxiety attacks and the knowledge of having to attend an event where openness is unavoidable I have a small attack leading up to the event which further feeds the anxiety I get at the event. I subsequently have severe depression the following day because of my anxiety and because of its effects on others around me and how nobody understands how I feel. can compare it to the terror you feel when on an airplane in bad turbulence, while being on solid flat ground.  don't know what to do I've tried breathing techniques and wearing hats and trying herbs and supplements with little to no help. can't keep living like this and I need some advice, would something like xanax help a situation like this where leading to an open space event I could pre dose that so when I arrive the effects kick in? I have never had experience with the drug or any other anxiety med or depression med. encouraging thoughts or ideas could certainly help and also help me feel less alone in my problem that I often feel like I'm the only person on earth who finds the beach horrifying and anxiety inducing along with open views or heights and especially a dark night sky or a pure blue sky without clouds to have as sort of a ""ceiling"" my eyes can use to help reduce my fear of the ""void"" if that makes any sense. all!Outdoor/open spaces and intense fear of heights",1635359830,2401,451

The stomach pain is just barely starting while I've been getting the depo shot for a while. Or maybe its because I've been having an 4)irregular period. But the pain doesn't feel like cramps.

Anxiety,"M20 here. I have a girlfriend,  F21 that has an addiction to nicotine, specifically vaping. When we first met 2 years ago this was not a thing. However throughout the years she felt not close enough to her family who partied a lot,  and so she eventually started doing it when she was there. It started of small and wasn't a problem,  but I did try and warn her because addiction runs in the family. Eventually it got the point that she was addicted. It started off driving an hour both ways multiple nights a week to use her sisters. Then it multiplied when on a vacation. For the entire week she would use her sisters that they brought her, and I tried to warn her again. he'd say that she would only use it until it was empty. But i knew tbat wasn't going to be true, and sure enough she would get more and more. he knows that I hate it. I've tried talking to her about it and she knows that she has an addiction, but I feel like she keeps making empty promises like ""I'll stop when the semester is over and I graduate."" I just have these extreme panic/anxiety attacks daily. There are some days I can barely function because I think about her and this addiction that I just want to go away. It just disgusts me how she has to hit her vape when she wakes up,  has to take it everywhere she goes. And my anxiety just always focuses on it and I just need help trying to rationalize it because I feel like it consumes my entire life.Panic attacks about recurring thoughts?",1635357950,1472,281

Anxiety,"so I had a shitty week and since unday I constantly felt it was hard to breathe, it feels like I have to tell my lungs to breathe in and out, I feel like I might throw up. My first thoughts were that I am having an anxiety attack, but then I checked how other people describe it, they say they feel like they are dying. It's not as severe for me, but it is happening for a long time, sometimes stronger, sometimes not as strong. there was only one time that I felt something like this, but it was worse then. Then I was also shaking with my whole body and couldn't stop crying.  I know why this is happening. I am working on a school project with a super toxic person that shouts and gaslights me when I have an opinion, but not ""enough evidence to support it"". I know I shouldn't be working with him, and I whish I could stop, but there is no one else I could join or start doing everything from scratch myself, because the first evaluation is going to happen very soon. The first time I had this type of attack that I mentioned, was when I confronted this person last year about how I hated working with him, but like I said he gaslighted me into thinking that I was making this whole thing up and I thought I could try working with him again. Please don't judge me on that, I thought we were friends at the time, but he is the most toxic person I have ever met, I didn't know any better. the fact that my dog got lost last night did not help at all.

Anxiety,"Hello, thanks for taking the time to read this.  history: I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety disorder 3 years ago. I am not on any anti-anxiety meds right now. I don't actively suffer from claustrophobia but have had anxiety attack instances where that played a part. I was driving my colleague home and we got stuck in a bad traffic jam. I hadn't eaten much all day so when I started having feelings of discomfort and nausea, I thought it was just hunger. But within a few minutes I also started feeling like I was going to throw up, heart palpitations, weakness in my limbs, severe lightheadedness, tingling in my hands and had to tell my colleague to take control of the car as I was sure I was going to pass out. didn't pass out, and when we pulled the windows down and got out of traffic I felt much better.  this sound like it could be an anxiety attack? It came out of nowhere and hit me like a ton of bricks. I have had panic attacks in the past but always with breathing issues. This time I had none of that.Help!

Anxiety,"Hi, all, 29F, new to posting here. I see from searching that this is a pretty common problem, but I would LOVE some suggestions on pushing past it. ince I believe that my anxiety caused the psychosomatic tinnitus, and now the tinnitus is causing more anxiety, I think all I need is to break the vicious cycle.  background -- I likely have OCD/anxiety and have a definite and repeated pattern of fixating on physical ""problems"" which are not in fact real (or which no other person would possibly notice or care about).  a month ago, I randomly read an article about tinnitus (not sought out -- it popped up on my Facebook feed). In response to this, my OCD brain told me to 'test' whether I might have tinnitus, despite no real signs of such ever in my past. Lo and behold, being in a quiet environment and really focusing on it, I did indeed ""hear"" (or perceive) a very quiet noise. Again, this was literally within seconds of reading the article. I know lol -- it would almost be funny if it didn't suck so bad!  then, when I am in a very quiet environment and focus very hard, I do indeed ""hear"" various noises -- sometimes ringing, sometimes a high pitched tone, sometimes rushing, etc. It does not interfere with/overpower my ""real"" hearing at all.  seems to kind of come and go -- I will have a few bad days, followed by a few good. I think the problem is I insist on ""testing"" my ""tinnitus"" ***countless*** times per day -- I will literally sequester myself in a quiet closet at home to listen for it. also worth noting that this came about during a very stressful time during which 1. My grandpa was dying (and has since passed), 2. My husband just had an accident and was in the process of getting into rehab and 3. I was (and still am) working in corporate law. have since had my hearing tested, and it is ""excellent"" according to the audiologist, so that's good.  this problem is indeed psychosomatic, does anyone have any suggestions for dealing with it -- specifically, breaking the cycle of the ""tinnitus"" causing me anxiety, which then causes the ""tinnitus"" to continue. I am planning to talk to a psychiatrist about this, but am having some delays getting an appointment with the person I want to speak to. ANY suggestions would be so very much appreciated. Thank you!Psychosomatic tinnitus -- suggestions pls :)",1635356967,2327,418

Was the first time I went to therapy then to the psychiatrist simultaneusly and started the medication. first thing I noticed that the medication took away was the feeling of anguish. Before I was officially diagnosed, there was this one time when I took a look at my own feelings and realized I had a terrible urge for crying for no reason at all. There was absolutely nothing wrong in my life at that time. I came to notice that this feeling of anguish was always there waiting to be triggered. I stopped the taking the medication, the feeling of anguish returned and I'm tired of feeling like this. Right now I'm experiencing and it's exhausting and I feel like doing nothing. I was supposed to go to swimming (cause that's the sport I do) but I don't want to. I'm tired of not being a functional human being.

Anxiety,"A few weeks ago I posted [this small progress post about me raising my hand in class for the first time]( and the advices I received HELPED ME O MUCH! EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THEM! overcame my anxiety of speaking up in class. I started slowly by asking a doubt in the class of a professor I thought was the nicest and calmest, I realized that my question was stupid as soon as the words came out of my mouth, and I then realised that no one cared about my mistake because half the people don't understand what's going on in class and the rest don't care. I then progressed to speaking up in my core paper class where I again answered wrong and nobody cared. But I realised the more I answered the more confident I became and now I've gone from never-ever-speaking-up-in-class to challenging my professor's solutions and speaking up when I don't understand something. I've even become (probably) my favourite professor's favourite student in my favourite class! (the no. of times I wrote the word favourite tho). I used to be afraid that I wouldn't be able to score in the interaction based practical classes but I was one of the first people who spoke up and got themselves evaluated (basically in these classes we get marked based on our interaction eith the professor, so the one who talks a lot gets the most marks and vice versa). And lastly, I am proud to say that I've become one of those popular nerd kids in my batch (yes, nerds are popular in Asia) and I love that professors know me by name already (it's been a bit more than a month and a half of online classes) anyone who are still struggling with speaking up in classes, please [read the comments on my previous posts because they cured something so severe that I've had since as long as I can remember]( you again, guys. ee you in my next post seeking help about my severe exam anxiety.I am now an active participant in my online classes",1635354415,1900,350

I knew I couldn't finish all of it, and that I was going to ruin my entire life.

When i confronted him in person that it upsets me and adds up to my anxiety and I like to see effort from him too, he answered that he doesn’t even use his phone much and doesnt care about the virtual world and that he rather focus on us in the world.

Planes were basically off limits until this summer when I forced myself to get on a flight with my dad. The first one was pretty horrible, but the second was a breeze. started dating a *wonderful* guy last winter. Unfortunately, we are now long distance as he's a military officer and got sent somewhere for training. We weren't long distance for about 7 months, but now we've been long distance for 4. I actually *drove* 16 straight hours by myself in August to go visit him like it was nothing, and I stayed at his house for 2 weeks with virtually no anxiety, which was a HUGE accomplishment.  flew up to visit me in eptember, and again in October. I was supposed to go in October, but I was too stressed, so I said I'd come in November instead. I split his October plane tickets since it was supposed to be my turn. I bought my plane tickets for November about a week ago, but I haven't had a calm day since. I have a constant pressure on my chest and I'm nauseous most of the day, every day. I've been crying and losing sleep. I *do not* want to fly alone. I don't want to go visit him, I don't want to be away from home. I want to see him more than anything but my anxious feelings are so overwhelming that it takes any pleasure out of the experience. I've mentioned to him that I'm anxious about it, but I don't think he knows it's this bad. don't know what to do. I want to cancel and see if he'd want to come visit me instead, but he's already flying up for Thanksgiving about a week and a half after I'm supposed to go to him. He is a very adventurous person so I'm embarrassed that I even have this fear. I feel like it makes me not right for him, even though I know he adores me. He's very understanding of my anxiety but I just don't think this is fair to do to him. He shouldn't have to deal with this, and it isn't fair if he's the one traveling every time.

I tried calling the business but there was no answer. I was thinking that I should just drive over to help open and then leave, but my boyfriend kept insisting that it was fine and to just stay at home and that everything would be fine. got a text from my boss at 10:30 just saying “Ok” and my anxiety around the situation has only gotten worse. I know he was probably busy or something but I feel like he’s mad at me. Before having the baby I was the type of person who would work even through being sick.

Anxiety,"It's already 2/3 years that I suffer from dizziness and basically one year that I'm seeing a neuropsychiatrist because I got to the point where I couldn't stand in class because of dizziness and I basically end up in the hallway crying because of this dizziness. years ago I went to the neurologist and they proposed to do a medical examination for nerves but I think we never did it,and my mum says that she doesn't remember about it,they probably wanted me to do it because I made a back surgery 4 years ago. when dizziness become too strong this year I went to do an MRI of the brain but there wasn't anything wrong. that I also had an appointment at the otolaryngologist we made some tests and in one where they make you balance with your eyes closed I was about to fall but I managed not to fall and in another they move you one way and in another in the cot and when they turned me to one side I started to feel dizzy but then it didn't last long. basically after that the doctor made me go to do the MRI. I still don't feel like the dizziness is related to the anxiety. get the dizziness even on moments where basically you don't have anxiety because there's nothing to be worried about? Like if I'm in the stairs I feel dizzy and like I'm about to fall,when I sit I'm worried to turn my back because that little movement makes me dizzy sometimes and sometimes even when I sit still I feel like I'm rolling backwards or to the side but in reality I'm not actually moving. I go for a walk that makes me dizzy too after some time. just think that if there's something else behind it all,I might actually ignore it and maybe living with something that I might get rid off easily.Is this really anxiety?",1635344835,1706,324

Anxiety," My boyfriend is proposing soon. Within the next couple of weeks. We have been together for 3.5 years and I am O happy. Unfortunately, I have been going through a REALLY bad bout of health anxiety lately. I have EVERE health anxiety. I wouldn't wish this on my worse enemy. I am literally convinced all the damn time, with 100% certainty, that I have some terrible illness.  Every few days it's literally something new and I am 100% convinced I have cancer. This is all I can think of, which makes me not even look forward to the proposal. But this proposal is something I've been waiting for and I want it to be the ONLY thing on my mind. This past week, I have been obsessing about this one specific cancer. Going to a doctor to ease my mind before the proposal won't work because the specific nature of my worry would require a referral (GPs don't deal with it so they always refer you) and the wait time for this specialty is around a YEAR (wait times for non urgent matters can be VERY long where I live and can still be weeks for urgent matters). Before this current worry, I had a worry before that. And another worry before that. Etc. With NO break. The only reason I move on from a worry is because I start to worry about something else.  have been crying to my partner every day over the past week. We spend hours a day talking about my health worry. This isn't fair to him either since he also wants a magical proposal. He admitted to me yesterday that he's worried about the proposal because he doesn't want to talk about health worries during it. He also doesn't want to talk about them in the time leading up to it because he wants the time before, during, and after the proposal to be really magical. And I 100% agree. He wants me to show him that I am working really hard on this. Right now, I am asking for an INANE amount of reassurance and constantly breaking down whenever I google something or prod my body (I haven't googled in 3 days so that's an improvement!). I just want to stop this and enjoy this moment in my life. I want this proposal to be the only thing on my mind. I want to stop bugging my boyfriend about this because I want this to be an incredible moment for him too. But as you know, with health anxiety, that is VERY hard. You feel out of control at times. And when I don't ask for reassurance, I end up basically exploding from stress and end up breaking down. I need help right now. I want to only think about this moment (but with HA, all that's running through my mind is ""I will probably be dead"" so then I get sad when I think about it). Ideas? posted this on the HA subreddit, but this one is more active so I am posting it here too. am in between therapists.

Anxiety,"I have been experiencing weird anxiety lately. The kind that tries to dampen all the things I believe I have under control.

But overwhelmingly lately I’ve been picking apart decisions and past decisions I’ve made in life. I have overcome a lot of traumas and stupid choices but have a great life now.  have a great support system, this morning I talked to three important people this morning  in my life trying to get out of it and move on. But the anxiety is still there n I cried anyways . I’ve been trying to do more enriching activities for myself like painting and working out.

Anxiety,"Tldr: I have a tendency to avoid and fear change, and I don't know if my thoughts around this job offer are my real thoughts or just ways to give in. How do I separate those fears from legit concerns about the job?  been in my current position for 3 years and getting bored. I have a great team, good time balance, and a supportive manager who I don't want to screw over by leaving. I took some interviews to see how marketable I am, and landed a position that I need to decide on soon. It will train me in new techniques that I wouldn't use in my current position. I'll likely grow in my career there more than I will at my current one, and it'll boost my current salary by 45% (though I'm doing fine so that isn't a central consideration). I don't know what the team culture is like there at all.  it's in the U health insurance space, and we all know that those companies are just profiting off of desperate people. I don't know if I'm blowing this concern up because it's a great excuse to stay in my current position for a while longer, or if I'll actually feel dirty and empty inside for cashing in.  are some techniques to know what's a defense mechanism and what's a real concern for me?I can't figure out what my emotions really are about my job offer.",1635335547,1261,241
Anxiety,"Currently working for a startup where I was hired to do a job where, honestly, I was unqualified at the end of the day. I got zero training and was really thrown to the wolves and I’m not in a position where I can grind 24/7 to figure it out. One month in and being in terrible moods (I have bad anxiety) and no WFH - I decided I’m putting in my notice. I did so once and was told to think about it so I did. I did so again and had another long chat where I was told to give it a chance, they will allow WFH for a bit, and change my damn role Bc I’m too good to just let leave. I felt so bad that I was even talking about leaving a month in that I said OK. Not I’ll think about it but I said OK I’ll give it until Jan. week, bc of the above, I reached out to my old job. I have an interview with my old job today where I know what I’m doing, fullWFH, and decent pay but I left for a reason. I was busy and hit up consistentlyThroughout the day. BUT it’s a larger corp so the benefits and stressors are a bit smaller IMO.  had every intention of leaving and now I am in a situation even worse Bc I’m going to burn bridges regardless.

Anxiety,"At the back of my head and my neck, sometimes I get this tingly feeling that will not go away. Like an itch that won't go away. I often get this feeling when I am stressed, before/in the middle of a breakdown, when someone says something that triggers me (oftentimes for no reason), or even just me being in a room that has negative connotations. ometimes there doesn't seem to be a reason at all. There doesn't seem to be a way to get it to go away, and I always want to scream, cry, tear my skin off, hit and punch myself, shake my head violently, anything to just get the feeling out, but none of that works. Often there's also this feeling in my head of *noise*, but it isn't loud? Noise it the best way I can describe it, but there isn't any volume. Like a toddler got a black crayon and mercilessly scribbled all over my brain. I can feel the noise, but I don't hear it, and it doesn't go away. I don't really understand what this is, so if someone could help me be able to get a better picture, that'd be great.

Anxiety,"When I tell you, baking helps with anxiety, it really does.  a person who suffers from having a anxiety attack almost every day. As well as panic attacks on the daily. I have discovered a comfort that I hope can help others. know it seems crazy, why would baking help with my anxiety. Here’s why.  at home doing nothing, getting lost in your own head can be over whelming. Can give you over thinking thoughts and stress you out.  with baking your having to focus on the task at hand. You want to make sure this comes out right. And once it’s done guess what, you get to enjoy it.  I made pecan pie bars, apple pie, oatmeal cookies, haystacks, and lemon cookies. ( then spaghetti for dinner). The whole time I wasn’t looking at my phone to see if my boyfriend texted me yet. I wasn’t worried if mom was still mad at me from the argument we got into last night. I just turned on eptember x Congratulations on my tv and had a blast.  I wasn’t baking I took the time to text my boyfriend inviting him over for pie. He said he probably couldn’t, so I figured oh well that’s okay! I wasn’t stressed or upset. Because I still had things to do.

Anxiety,"Hi there, I don’t know where else to post this so I am turning here. The purpose of this post is to find anyone who has suffered something similar and to hear your ideas and experiences on how you have overcome or learned to cope with this.  husband is 27 and works a desk job as a buyer for a retail chain. He had this panic issue once before, during his senior year of high school, but after graduating it went away.  is the situation: My husband started this job a year and a half ago. He has always been great at what he does and has excelled here. Now obviously there are challenges, and one of those being that it is a fast-paced environment and his managers are very “go go go”. Another word is they are very “corporate”. But that has never been a problem until now, and I asked what triggered it and he said he has no idea. There was nothing that really changed much since he began this job. is NOT scared of public speaking. He actually really likes it. But the panic attacks started when he had to give a presentation over the summer and it hit him all at once. He wasn’t scared for the presentation that he KNEW of, but once the fast heartrate hit, he couldn’t slow the panic down and he lost it. He had to leave the room and could not give the presentation. It was very embarrassing for him and he called me crying. It has slowly degenerated into panic attacks every single day where he throws up and feels like he is having a heart attack. Every. ingle. Day. Because he has meeting every day, and he gets a panic attack before every meeting. There are days I have to drive his commute with my toddler, meet him in the parking lot, and give him a back massage and help him calm down just for his weekly zoom call with his boss (super easy 10 minute call).  explained it to me like this: the panic is not the fear of the meeting itself or speaking. The panic attack causes my throat to tighten and I can’t get words out or speak. o then I panic more at the thought of being frozen. And now, I’m at the point where I pre-panic because I know I will panic. o my panic attacks come at THI point because I am panicking ABOUT the fact that I will probably have a panic attack. o then my body just fully panics right then just thinking about it. And it happens every day before my meetings. he is starting to really lose it. He is barely functioning as is and knows he will crack at some point and quit. I know him, and that is probably true because this is getting BAD. He cries every night.  is what we have done so far. We have pursued everything we can with our religious and spiritual beliefs to help bring him peace, but he feels like God has abandoned him. This is a very damaging thought for him, as a generally highly spiritual Christian person. That has really put him in a depression. We also saw our doctor who tried some anxiety and panic meds, but those made it astronomically worse. o we got him to a psychiatrist as soon as I could get us in. he has prescribed 10 mg of fluoxetine, .1 mg of clonidine, a low dose of slow release adderall, and some vitamins. he diagnosed him with ADHD and said that it is causing a lot of the anxiety and depression because it has been untreated. he said in time she will observe how much of the ADHD is related to the panic. We have also been doing everything she told us- the progressive muscle relaxation, meditations, breathing exercises, and… nothing. It has been 4 weeks and he has still had the panic attacks. In one week we have his follow-up appt, but he is crying right now telling me its hopeless and he will never be cured, he will never be normal again. He doesn’t think theres hope or a point to even go back to the psych. Obviously I am going to make us go, but is there anything else that we are missing here? Is this our only hope? Can panic attacks be cured? He tells me that he believes its all mental so it’s his “fault” so he can never be cured because a medication can’t change his thoughts.  grasping at straws here.

Anxiety,"I have an extremely embarrassing problem regarding anxiety. I’m a 44-year-old woman and have never been in a relationship. I met a guy 3 years ago and we have become good friends. I know he thinks of me as just a friend but I do harbour feelings for him.  I have never told him how I feel, though. Last week he confided in me that another woman had expressed interests in him. He was unsure if he wanted to accept her and asked me for advice. I try to be as impartial as I can, and basically told him to go with his heart. We then chatted about some other stuff and that was not mentioned again so I did not know what he decided to do. Yesterday, he steered the conversation towards a bit more adult stuff.  I was excited by this and opened up to him a little more (but not about the fact that I have feelings for him). Today, he told me that he had decided to be with that woman, and that was why he was kind of playful in our chat. I don’t think I am qualified to say that I’m heartbroken, but it still stinks. I have experienced this numerous times before: I like a guy, he doesn’t like me back, and I hear that he has a significant other. I feel completely tensed with all the classic anxiety syndrome: tensed up throat, dizziness, muscular tension, breathing difficulties. The frustrating thing is that I know this is coming. I think I have more experience than anyone in this type of disappointment, and yet I still can’t get a handle on my bodily reaction to rejection like this. There is sadness; there is frustration; and there is anxiety.

Anxiety,"I don't know what I'm doing. I haven't been to school in three weeks and I've barely left the house at all. I've taken some walk barely down the street but I sit in the open garage to get some light. It's so peaceful but with each second I'm not distracting myself I feel terribly guilty. fear getting into the car, going shopping, taking road trips, eating with my family because of my Misophonia, etc. sister and I were in a very small car accident because this new yorker tried scamming us or whatever he was doing by stomping on his breaks randomly. It was kinda funny because right after we hit him, a firetruck and a paramedic came out of nowhere and came over to talk. They were trying to find an accident that happened nearby so they didn't stay long. I had just had surgery to have my tonsils taken out, like a week or so before and so I couldn't talk. They were all so concerned when I wouldn't answer their questions. And yes, I am using this discussion like a diary because I don't ever get to vent anywhere else. didn't get away with it and got nothing from us. I didn't get back into the car for a long while after that, not because I was afraid but because I just didn't go out and then my anxiety just started getting worse and worse from there. Now it's nearly impossible to get into the car and I ruin the mood when I have panic attacks. just feel sick physically all of the time, and I'm pretty sure it's only because of my anxiety. I'm not failing my important classes (all of my classes except two of my electives that I hardly ever go to) and I try to do my homework when I stay home. (I say try because I'm terrible at school and I can't do a lot by myself) just feel like a failure. My sister has been working since she was 17 and doesn't have much support from my parents even though she lives with us at 20. Our parents are kinda abusive and I never really had their support until a couple of years ago it started building up again. Now I'm closer with my mom but I always feel like a burden to everyone. just feel like it isn't fair to my sister that I'm like this and I get all this support when she doesn't have any at all. little bit ago my mom says that in order to get anxiety medication I have to meet with a specific type of therapist who can prescribe it, but apparently there are only a few in my state. And she is going to let me go to a therapist. I'm just so scared that I'm stuck like this and that I'm ruining my life by not going to school. already missed like 38 days of my senior year but they all have been excused. I'm also in special ed and I'm trying to use my 504 to get a teacher to come by the house to give me work and help me a little. Apparently, I can do that, it beats going to school. scared I might get in a lot of trouble at school because I haven't gone in weeks and I nearly stay home at least once every week.

Anxiety,"Why do “negative” emotions need to be fixed? When we’re happy, we let the emotion sit and feel it through. We don’t fix it. Why don’t we do the same with anger, sadness and anxiety? I learned the reaction and perception of my “negative” emotions exacerbated them. The shame, guilt and resentment over normal human emotions made them worse.  would be anxious about developing cancer and the innate urge to do something about this anxiety by Google searching or seeking reassurance made it worse. Anxiety is not a bad emotion. It is simply uncomfortable. It can even be helpful at times to let us know when we’re in a dangerous situation. If it was truly bad, could it ever be helpful?Emotions are like time. They’re just there. There is no “bad or good” emotions. imply just ones that make you uncomfortable but they all come and go and are all VERY normal.  can never be right or wrong because they’re just there. They’re inherent to our existence. “Negative” emotions should be partnered with, not fixed. can apply this same logic to thoughts. Thoughts that are scary, troubling, anxiety-provoking may be uncomfortable but are they ever “bad”? Thoughts are also inherent to our existence, why would thinking ever be bad? They are one in one with emotions. They’re just there. Claim your thoughts and emotions as your own. They’re yours, they’re your baby.

Like 2-3 months ago I had a pain in My back near the shoulder blade, googled my symptoms and obviously it was like the worse case scenario, my hands started feeling numb, heart beat going a thousand miles an hour had to go to the ER ( I don't know if this was a panic attack never had one before).

I honestly did not want to rush my decision about taking the vaccine and I feel as though it was shoved down my throat ( I took this vaccine in fear of not being able to participate on social activities, protecting myself came 2nd) . I explained to her how the government was taking away our freedom in a way. he got really judgmental and starting stating facts and arguments about covid and how I was “ignorant” for not reading more about the vaccine as a science student and how I was “selfish” for not immediately taking the vaccine. he was attacking me in a way. I haven’t read that many articles about the vaccine, I’m not against it. I just thought that it should be a choice. And that you should be allowed to take your time. Anyways when she started calling me these names I just froze and was unable to defend myself due to anxiety. I felt really nervous and I didn’t know what to do. I have never been in a situation like this before. I couldn’t even hear what she was saying anymore. I didn’t leave the library I just explained my point again and  changed the subject.  awhile she tells me “I want to become a lawyer and I like making people feel small and stupid with my arguments” I replied to her by saying that is rude.  I realized that, it is exactly what she was doing to me. was just telling her my opinion and she turned it into some kind of debate. question is have you ever been in this kind of situation where someone belittles you and you feel so anxious and your heart starts racing and you just freeze and you are unable to defend yourself? should I do in a situation like this if ever happens to me again?  what do I do if I see this person again?

Long time Reddit lurker here and new to posting so i apologize for any mistakes in formatting or grammar. been one of the worst days I’ve had in a long time and after being in a toxic friendship for 11 years, it finally ended and I feel relief that I don’t have to constantly have anxiety anymore and sadly she’s not completely out of my left since I introduced to my friend group and basically gave up everything I had that was safe and  in the process she became good friends with my best friend and it has greatly affected my friendship with her and now our relationship is now strained today and it’s all been giving me extremely bad anxiety and has left me feeling insane and today made me realize I can’t cope with this on my own anymore and I need a lot of help with things going on in my life and figuring out how to navigate the murky waters.  one of my biggest fears and anxieties is they won’t be helpful and judge me, it’s incredibly embarrassing to admit but I don’t have any friends near me and all of mine have been online and I feel like it works for my life but my anxiety tells me they aren’t going to understanding and just tell me to go outside or something? anyone here have experience on talking to one about online friends?  anyone have any suggestions on how to find a good therapist? feel extremely alone and I can’t cope with my anxiety telling me I’m constantly messing up or the people around me all telling me different things I’m just extremely scared and anxious about starting this journey and need some help and advice from people who aren’t around me and have any recommendations on how to proceed going forward and what to prepare for having one.  thank you for your time!Anxiety on finding a therapist.",1635299103,1745,324

Anxiety,"One thing that really made my anxiety better was to quit Twitter, Instagram and Facebook. I only check them if I really need to (searching for information or reaching out to people that don't use the same message app as I do). Now I only use Reddit frequently cause I feel like I can control more what I see, so I can chose a more positive timeline. Having a app that shows you how many time you spend on social media also can help to bring awareness of the time you're spending. Try to use your regular social media time to read, go outside for a walk or baking, meditate or just do whatever brings you real joy.I know that this doesn't work for everyone, but we are all way to attached to social media that sometimes we forget how the real world really looks like. Be aware that quitting is hard and can take months, but it's worth it. At least it was for me, really helped me a lot. No human being should be controlled by a algorithm.Quit social media",1635298699,954,182
Anxiety,"I have been taking antidepressants for 10 years or so. I have always had a problem with my anxiety but only recently has it become debilitating. I asked my psychiatrist to prescribe a benzodiazepine and she refused stating its ""no longer the standard of care.""  I had a prescription for years, never abused them and gave most of them to my mother anyway. Now I'm in nursing school and my stress is through the roof. I have become so sleep deprived from waking with anxiety about getting up early. I sleep probably 4-5 hrs a night. I'm in constant pain to the point where I can barely walk some days I'm assuming its cortisol causing widespread inflammation. he prescribed Vistaril; I have a hypersensitivity to Benadryl so I refused the prescription. I was then prescribed gabapentin which helped me sleep better but did not do much fo my anxiety. Is there anything else off label like these that have helped you all?? he's making me feel like a lowly drug seeker but my life is falling apart, I'm missing work because of my panic attacks now.

Anxiety,"I had a new customer today who was chatty and friendly and we kept talking for a while after I already helped him and it was nice. He would move to the side to let me help other customers and then come back to talk to me multiple times so I kinda figured this was more than just regular customer chatter. And I think he mistook my customer service/ cheerful persona for flirting. I kinda had a feeling he was gonna ask me out, so in my head I was prepared to say no even though I did find him attractive and easy to talk to, but my anxiety just ruins my dating experiences and I just wasn’t up for that awful feeling of nerves to the point of nausea and panicking over every little interaction. Then he asked me out and I panicked and said yes bc I got anxious about rejecting him. He asked for my number and then left. And I’ve been a ball of anxiety since then.  texted me after I got off work with a simple “hi, how are you?” And I’ve been panicking even though I know it’s nothing. It’s been 3 hours and I feel awful for not responding yet but idk how to tell him I change my mind on going out bc it feels so rude since I already gave him my number. But I also don’t want to ghost him. I think what makes it worse is that this happened at my job (library) so I’ll probably see him again.  don’t think I’d mind just being his friend but idk if my anxiety would allow that either. Could y’all help me figure out what to tell him? I’m not sure how to word it. Also has anyone else experienced this before?

It’s holding me back more than ever and I feel like every day it’s just spinning out of control.

The only problem is, today I met with a psychiatrist, who told me I don't have OCD because I don't have compulsions/ritualistic behavior.  guess I'm basically wondering, are intrusive thoughts common for people with anxiety?

Anxiety,"I (17M) just started university this year. This summer, I thought I had gotten over my anxiety and depression, I was so happy and had no worries. However after 2 weeks, my anxiety came back. This was in early eptember, and ever since then it had been a roller coaster with my anxiety. It felt like every couple days my anxiety would take a new form, or I would have a stretch of 3 days where I had none at all, think I was over it, and then it would come back for over a month now I have been dealing with anxiety again. Before this summer my anxiety was ALWAY about how I looked, my appearance and just worried about being awkward. But over the past month it has been changing form every few days, one day I’ll be worried about my gf for no reason, then the next I’ll be anxious about my future, etc. week was TERRIBLE. It was the worst I had felt in over a year, it felt like more depression than anxiety. I went home this weekend and I felt so much better, my symptoms went away after about 2 days at home. I came back to university yesterday, and almost immediately I felt a little more anxious, but still felt good and the anxiety wasn’t very bad. However once my classes started this week, I just got hit with anxiety soon as I started sitting in class, I couldn’t stop worrying about everything. I went back to obsessing over how I looked, convincing myself I’m ugly even though I get called attractive a lot and on most days I think I’m good looking. I was worrying about my posture, my hair and face, my classes, my gf, working out, just almost anything I could think about.  not like I was overwhelmed by my classes either, I felt calm about the class but couldn’t stop worrying about mainly my appearance. I do have a very busy week this week though, maybe that’s it I leave class it starts getting better right away, and usually after a couple hours I’m back to normal. My only worry is that eventually it will stop going away after class is it like this?

This specific night I smoked and spent the next hour in a state of panic. I still have no clue what happened to me but I can only describe it as a panic attack. I had all the normal symptoms, I felt an otherworldly sense of dread, I thought I was going to move on from this world, I had time loops that I thought were never going to end, It certainly felt longer than an hour. But most importantly, it was the most painful experience I've ever had. I had this weird feeling that I could feel everything in my body on a hypersensitive state. For example, I could literally feel the muscles in my foot being strained when I was in an uncomfortable position, it was excruciating. I don't blame the weed as I have done it before and been fine, but I do think it was a trigger for me. never smoked since.

Anxiety,"(For context I am a student in my mid-late(ish) teens) I don't really trust telling anyone with my emotions so I'm not good with asking for help but I thought Reddit might help with what I may be feeling (I just feel like I need to talk to someone).  **\[also really sorry since this is so long, you can just skip if it's annoying\]**  When at school I often feel sick in my stomach and have a racing heartbeat for no reason and feel tight in my throats and feel stressed out sometimes only by being in the class, I get random aches sometimes too and can't stop tensing my stomach. I can't speak in front of large groups of people or be in rooms with even small groups of unknown people without laughing uncontrollably, freezing in place or uncontrollably crying (though I mainly just start laughing uncontrollably then sit down disappointed at not being to say what I wanted with the people in my class, in small social events or just a group of unknown people I would probably start crying, though not noticeably if i can and try to hide it.) and feeling stressed.   I'm generally too anxious to look anyone in the eye when talking to them, even my closest friends. I feel like I can relax more at home more but for some reason always feel irritated when talking to my mom or just empty in general and do nothing productive but watch youtube or exercise to blow off steam but doesn't always work. I always want to make friends or have a normal conversation with my peers but fail by just not making eye contact at all or speaking really strangely (such as my voice going higher or shaky). I only feel like I can speak normally in class when near my friends but I still can't maintain proper eye contact when speaking one on one with them and always overthink what I say and how people perceive me. I still laugh and speak normally at breaktimes (With friends) though so i can't tell if I'm just overreacting and feeling normal anxiousness or getting my emotions mixed up.    start crying, stressed and avoid simple tasks such as one time needing to ask a teacher if I can head to a prearranged dentist appointment because I was too scared to talk to the teacher ???? it was illogical and I still think it's dumb but probably would still over stress if it happened again. I can't speak to cashiers in stores without feeling scared and can't maintain eye contact. Though I've never had a panic attack or felt trembly/shaky from my stress before.   I feel anxious and just sad so much in my life I struggle to do basic things such as daily basic hygiene though I cant tell if I am just lazy, or study even though I know I should and want to study but feel worthless and stressed even before I've read a full sentence of a revision book, I wonder if that's just normal student stress though.  \- I feel bad about how I look to the point I overeat sugary, high caffeine foods or only eat a single meal a day for a week at a time. If I think about the present - i feel unhappy and worthless, i think about the future - i feel pessimistic, have no idea where to go and worthless, i think about the past - i wonder who i used to be and miss not feeling overly stressed all the time. I can't tell if I'm overreacting like an angsty teenager or really need to speak to someone, but i don't trust any teachers or my parents or siblings or anyone at all and this isn't unprompted I'm sure they would just laugh and belittle me or make it worse and that isn't even me overreacting, they've shown they don't care and my symptoms aren't visible as I normally try to be outgoing best I can when I'm with my friends, and my 2 close friends seem to either have too much going on themselves (which makes me think I'm overreacting again) or have no idea how to respond to me saying such things.    \-I don't feel too happy although I smile lots, like there's something always weighing on my mind even when I'm doing something fun.  I feel not calm but more empty a lot when alone. I just want to speak to people without feeling terrified and needing to cry and want to feel happy with life. If I lost my 2 close friends, I probably would not cope, I also feel incredibly lonely a lot of the time even though there are people near me??? I would say this is just an episode of depression a person feels in their life, but It's been this way for at least a year now and it keeps getting worse, so much to the point, I'm wondering if I do actually have a real problem. Then again I'm probably overreacting. Idk what to do even if I had a problem though. What do you guys think? Once again, sorry this is so long! I just kind of wanted to talk a little, this will probably get deleted anyway soon.Is this anxiety or am I just overthinking?",1635290184,4716,892

Anxiety,"Ugh so this might sound like nothing bad but it’s really affecting me. o buckle in because I haven’t talked about it to anyone and Reddit is my best anonymous outlet. I’m in my last year of university. All my housemates last year were in their final year. The house was shit but we all got along so well (all female) and clicked because we were all laid back and very tolerant. This year as their courses have ended, I’ve had to move in with people I didn’t know. Two females. One of them is lovely and sweet - the other one… seemed lovely at first. he made me feel welcome and opened up to me about no longer being on the course because of poor grades and about past housemates that have left them in debt and shit situations. I thought we were getting along great, even though I walked in on her bitching about “someone” a few times. he always stopped abruptly when I walked in and I began to wonder if it was me she bitched about. I just assumed I was being paranoid as we would laugh and watch films together, and that she must be talking about a former housemate who they’ve had trouble with.  then 3 weeks into me staying here, I went on a night out with people from my course. My first and only night out so far this academic year. I came back in the middle of the night extremely drunk and made myself some toast. I accidentally set the fire alarm off because I burnt it. It rang for about 10-20 seconds before stopping. I left a couple of dirty dishes out but nothing extortionate and nothing I hadn’t seen done already on that house. The next day, hungover, I woke up to a tirade of nasty aggressive messages from this one housemate saying I left the kitchen a mess (literally 2 dishes… like I’ve been in student houses that have been so much worse) and berating me for using her sponges for washing up. In all my previous houses cleaning utensils were always shared it’s always just been a mutual understanding so I didn’t even think that this would be any different. I would not have minded being corrected were the messages not so harsh and nasty after I thought we’d been getting along for so long. he excused her shitty mood with the fact that the alarm woke her up, and demanded I give an apology, which I gave willingly. I felt shit about everything and so guilty, but was determined to be civil because we live together and also I can’t do conflict. I can’t be at odds with people for long it just tears me apart.  opened up to these people about a lot of my anxieties and history with mental illness. What is more, because we are no longer officially a student house, with her having to withdraw, we now have to pay council tax, which she insisted we all split between us, even though we were signed up for it before I moved in, I wasn’t warned beforehand that I’d have to pay it, and I’m a student so shouldn’t be paying it anyway. I haven’t said one thing to complain about it but I just feel like I’m being made to feel unwelcome and unwanted in a house that I’m paying council tax for, despite me having done my very best to bond with both of them (and I can’t stress enough the other girl is lovely but they’ve been friends for years and I feel like it’s almost a clique situation and no one else living with them is going to be allowed to get close to them.) is all just so weird to me because I have always gotten along with my housemates but this doesn’t even feel like a student house. I’m not overly messy or overly noisy, and I think it’s unfair to expect total silence from ten or eleven onwards in a student house in a student village. I don’t talk loud, I don’t disturb boundaries. I just feel like that one incident with the fire alarm has made her mind up about me and she’s not willing to change it.  literally grovelled and finally cleared the air with her a few days later which brings us to today. I put my (small) load in the washing machine whilst one of her clothes were already in there, and put it on a small wash (was an emergency I’d just dirtied my shit) and she sent me a rant about why I’d done it, claiming it might shrink her shit (it didn’t) and flat out calling me stupid, an idiot, and refusing to heed any of my apologies. I would be more understanding but she and the other housemate have done this exact thing with my washing multiple times. I’m so sick of the passive aggressive and downright aggressive rants, plus she never confronts me in person which really angers me. It’s always by message, even though our rooms are next to each other. I’ve been crying for the past few hours because I feel so unwanted and unwelcome in this house, and I miss the old house and my old housemates so much even though this house is better quality.  really really want to move out and perhaps go looking somewhere else but I’m terrified of the inconvenience it will cause my family, and the girls living here. I keep wondering whether the problem is actually me because I can’t seem to do anything right here. just wanted to know the perspective of an outsider reading this because I’m so miserable here and I’m scared to tell anyone because I’ve never changed accommodation mid-academic year and I know that even if I suggest it I’ll cause so much inconvenience. I told my parents I was happy here because at first I was, but things went downhill so quick and I don’t know if all the anger and aggression towards me is justified or not. Paying council tax is bad enough as I have no money, but I wouldn’t even mind if I was made to feel like I was welcome in the house. I’m scared to leave my bedroom because I feel so unwanted and in the way all the time all this anger towards me justified? Am I being over dramatic? Im sorry to post this long thing but I don’t feel like I have anyone to talk to because I don’t want to let people down by expressing my longing to move out. I have never ever adopted a hostile or aggressive tone in the group chat but I’m so sick of getting called stupid. I had to take a year off uni a couple years back due to mental health issues and I don’t want this last year to be miserable but so far it’s just been hell.My living situation is really affecting my mental health - do I move out?",1635287016,6167,1176

I've made it clear that he has full run of the apartment, save for my bedroom. He can lie on the couch, walk through the complex (which is on the grounds of an old ranch, so lots of trees, grass, etc.), sit on the balcony and enjoy the weather, cook up a storm in the kitchen...and he does do a couple of these things.  he's expressed to me that he feels himself becoming agoraphobic. Being around a lot of people makes him very anxious. He knows he doesn't want that to happen. He's talked to his therapist about it and to me.

What if the anxious thoughts never stop and I hate my life for the next 18 months?  have to be in the office everyday 8-4 because all the clinical notes are paper.

Anxiety,"Been going to therapy for around 5 years now. I often feel like my shrink use my anxiety (social anxiety and possibly also generalised anxiety disorder) as a reason for every issue/bad experience I express, which at times annoy me as I feel it's an oversimplification and dismissal of my struggles. But at the same time I can kinda accept it, as the more I've learned about anxiety the more I realise how it can infect every minor thought and action. so in everything from doing the dishes at home, my obligatory military service 18 years ago, all the work-courses unemployment sent me on, like kindergarten assistant, nursing home assistant etc., and up to me now where I'm on my second year of nursing school and when I had my first practise in a retirement home, being effective, working independently and working fast as consistently been where I've lacked. And honestly it's unclear to me why. I haven't had a conscious experience of working slow, yet I've always ended up using more time than anyone else. example was when I was a nursing home assistant, and was supposed to make breakfast for a small unit, and clean the kitchen after. I was conscious about being fast, yet I went over the time I was given. Another day I watched another person make breakfast and clean the kitchen casually, while chatting it up with the elders, and somehow she ended up being done way faster than me. having had anyone observe me and give me feedback, if anxiety is the main reason I guess it just constantly adds up without me noticing how it affects my work. If there's one feeling I'm aware of that might be part of the reason it's this constant heavyness/feeling of sorrow/nervousness, but I still don't understand why it's so hard for me to be as effective as anyone else.So my shrink told me the reason I work slower than other people is due to anxiety - can anyone relate?",1635281744,1871,334

Anxiety,"This is gonna sound weird, but part of my anxiety comes from numbers. I don’t like the numbers 3, 39, anything ending in 3 or 0, sometimes 16. It’s weird and part of my anxiety comes from it. Here comes a dumb thing, I’m the middle child of my family, and I’m the third kid. There’s this video I saw that disturbed me with what was said in it. My brain wants me to show the video to my little brother, who is the 4th kid, to balance it out.

Anxiety,"I’m a junior in high school, and recently I have been feeling extremely anxious about going to school. I have not been diagnosed with anything because I have never spoken to anyone about my mental health, but I’m pretty sure I have social anxiety and maybe depression. I have a speech on Friday for english class and I have to perform piano in front of my music class. I’m honestly debating staying home, but my parents might not let me. I know avoiding the problem probably won’t help but I’m worried I will have a panic attack or freeze up during my presentations (which has happened before). I’ve also been super unmotivated recently. I used to be a straight A student, but now I’m just so anxious which prevents me from focusing on my studies. The past few days I haven’t been able to do any homework because my head is so jumbled. I feel like I dread everyday and I just want to be home. I’m debating emailing my counselor to have someone to talk to and maybe get an accommodation, (but idk how that works or if I’m allowed to get one.) Emailing my counselor and talking to him is another difficulty too :( .

The primary format is recorded therapy/counseling/life-coaching sessions conducted on the, “driver.” The modality of therapy is one particular tool we have accessible to us. We will also cover various other tools that can help us: meditation, yoga, diet, exercise, community, holistic alternatives, etc. I want the listeners to be just as much a part of the podcast as I!  space provides...No Filter. No Judgement. No hame. Real tories. Real Therapists or Counselors. Real Connection...as a Collective. am not a therapist or counselor, but this podcast features real mental health  professionals.

Anxiety,"o basically I have suffered with low self esteem nearly my whole life as well as anxieties to do with the social side of things, Banter being one of them as I don't get it or I for some reason feel offended by it and I don't know why I do. This makes me feel low in myself and inadequate in that I can't get socially interact when it comes to banter.  I had a frank chat with my best friend who has said a couple of things which has triggered my anxieties and also me feeling very self conscious of myself. One of them being that he remarked that I don't take banter and get offended and also a while ago, he made a comment of me being ditzy which I again started overthinking. If it was any other person I'd brush off the comment and put it down to the person not knowing me so well but being that it's from my best friend, it made me anxious and felt low in myself.  the last 5 years, I'd say I have managed to find a way of dealing with my anxieties and feeling much better about myself. However I do get events like this every now and then that take me back to a time where I feel a low sense of self esteem.  evening I had a good talk with my friend and opened up about these anxieties and feelings that he may not have been aware of all these years that he has known me for. He has said how sorry is over what he has said and apologised for setting off my anxieties.

I hate practicals in general (although I want to work in a lab in the future lmao), and I really struggle with them. I got so panicky today that I just froze. I couldn't do anything.

Anxiety,"I met sunshine at university during our master's degree. We  both chose to study one of the hardest and longest routes to qualification in the UK. unshine was born in another country and grew up initially in a single parent household relatively hand to mouth. he moved to the UK when she was 6, her parent worked very hard and is now extremely well off, remarried and has another child. unshines step parent is lovely and they have a good relationship. However her family moved to America when sunshine started her first degree, she has a strange relationship with her mother who seems to compensate for this with money. My background is the picture perfect childhood, very supportive and loving parents, financially I have never wanted for anything although I wouldn't class our family as rich.  sunshine grew up without much she is now very wealthy. We got on very very well at uni, we clicked and she was so much fun. Particularly important as our course was so intense and hard with extremely long hours. he's a little older than me and took some more time out working instead of studying so that she could follow her husband for his career. It was really important to me to qualify as fast as possible in order to get a better salary- I've always been upfront about this. unshine got engaged during our final year of our master's degree. he knew my plan was to do my diploma required to qualify fully asap after masters. he was planning her wedding and chose it on a date where I was booked into a residential weekend as part of the course. I couldn't qualify without attending this weekend of lectures. Her wedding venue was a 2.5 hour drive away and my lectures were 8-8 for 3 days. I was supposed to be her bridesmaid but I had to respectfully decline as I had already paid for the course when she announced the date. he was very upset and distant with me and asked if I would consider deferring my exams. I said no, this was something I had been working towards for 6.5 years and I was 1 year from finishing. I'd also already paid for the course and our salaries are crap until we qualify. I have a lot of student debt and wanted to progress.  entire wedding was extremely affluent, she had chosen bridesmaid dresses in excess of £300 each (which we were expected to pay for) a venue with a minimum 3 night stay at £280 per night. Plus hair make up hen do etc. I simply couldn't afford this as a student! This was the first issue in our relationship as I felt like she was slightly out of touch with reality and had turned a little bridezilla. Prior to this she had always been a little snobby but never to this extent. A few months after her wedding we did fall back into our normal routine and things seemed much better. However, over the last couple of years I feel like she has changed a lot whereas I'm still exactly the same person (personality wise).  had a rubbish time during covid 2020 with my employer and had to switch jobs as it had become untenable. A guy that sunshine used to work with was hired as my replacement. unshine has done nothing but bitch and complain about this guy for several years - I soon saw why when he joined my place of work as he was awful and I was scared for my clients as I didn't want to leave them in his hands but there was nothing I could do. unshine called me to chat and asked me how he was getting on. I then told her and ranted a little about how rubbish he was in terms of his attitude and she just completely 180d. she was saying I don't want any negativity I am close friends with this guy this makes me feel uncomfortable I don't know where you're coming from etc. I was so taken aback as she had brought this up and asked me. It turned into a bit of an argument over video call and I was very upset as I don't like confrontation or rowing. For me I felt like I didn't recognise the person she had become, we had always been supportive and compassionate to each other and she was so cold and detached. I distanced myself. unshine has recently turned to veganism, yoga etc which is absolutely fine, but she's become very very judgemental about anyone who doesn't subscribe to this. he has restricted herself from so many things even sugar and refusing to eat anything pre packaged! I do not subscribe to this lifestyle but I was very mindful to arrange lunch dates at places which would accommodate her etc. I felt like this was becoming a one way street and I was being judged and critised for just being myself- the person I have always been around her for years. My partner is a big meat eater, we love to entertain and go out for drinks, party etc when we can due to our stressful jobs but it became really difficult to include her in this. really pulled back further during 2021 as I have been having bad health issues and was waiting for an operation this year. he only wanted to schedule calls on a Thursday after work and it was extremely awkward I felt such anxiety on Thursdays trying to come up with safe topics of conversation that it was so draining. Due to work commitments it became virtually impossible to stick to such a rigid call routine and since July we haven't spoken at all. I stopped replying as I felt like I had nothing 'safe' to say. I didn't feel like I could share my health worries with her as my best friend because she was so judgemental and cold when I tried to broach the subject. feel awful. My parents regularly bump into her as we live relatively close by and she never asks after me so perhaps she doesn't care anymore? I feel such a loss for the friendship that we once had. My other friends have said that the relationship was toxic and said that I was trying to change myself around her to fit her needs. I agree with this to an extent as I felt so drained, but perhaps toxic is a very big word and not appropriate? I can't bear the thought of us ghosting, but I'm also so nervous to contact her to try and patch things up as there hasn't been a specific incident recently. I just stopped replying as I felt like I was being hurt and I didn't have the emotional capacity to deal with things due to my health worries. birthday is coming up in a few weeks. hould I send her flowers and perhaps write her a letter explaining my feelings? he is very, very extreme about covid so I doubt that she would want to meet me for coffee unless it was outdoors (we live in England it's too cold for me to do this at the moment while I'm healing from surgery)  Any advice would be so much appreciated and I'm sorry for how long this is!! There's a million more things I could say. this should be posted in a better suited forum please let me know!Thank you xShould I try and save this potentially toxic relationship?",1635274463,6703,1260
Anxiety,"I had what I assume was my first panic attack ever last week. It was absolutely terrifying. I was traveling alone in another city and all of a sudden I felt like I was gonna pass out. I’d been feeling a little weird all day. Like there were pins and needles in my arms and legs. I just thought I was tired because of the travel. I ended up passing out and then ambulance was called. I refused the ambulance because I knew it would cost me a fortune. I went back to my hotel room and spent the night alternating between jumping in a cold shower and putting ice on my forehead. I felt awful and shaky. It was one of the worst nights of my life. The next day I really thought I was dying so I went to the ER and they did a bunch of tests and everything was fine. They couldn’t confirm that it was a panic attack but from what I’ve looked up that’s what it sounds like. It’s been a few days now, and now every day I have these rolling waves of physical anxiety. I can feel my body start the tense up and shake. Nothing as bad as it was but first day, but I’ve never had anything like this in my life. One minute I am fine and I think everything‘s gonna be OK and it was just a one time thing, and the next minute my body starts to panic. I’ve always had anxious thoughts and I’ve always been a bit high strong, but these physical symptoms are so new. It’s so strange that from one day to the next it feels like my entire life has changed.

Anxiety,"Hi, this is ridiculous but I’m so depressed and anxious because of a permaban from a subreddit. I have health anxiety and I found that subreddit a few years ago and started using it whenever I had a panic attack about health anxiety related issues. It started being so recurrent that in order to write the posts faster, I started to copy the previous posts and only edit what changed, this means that the begging of the text is always the same (introduction and medical information) and it always has the question if I should go to the hospital which is why I write there, the health anxiety keeps me from being rational. I use that subreddit to get a rational opinion because if I follow my anxious mind, I keep going to the hospital for minimal things. ince I’ve been there for years, the information that I copy and paste is not updated anymore, in particular the age. I didn’t notice it a mod reviewed my profile and thinks that I’m a troll because according to the post’s history and the messages starting with the same phrases and permabanned the account. I realized now that the app that I’m using was also not updated so I didn’t know about the ban for days. Today I went to make a post while having a panic attack and it wasn’t working used another account on the website instead of the app and that’s when I realized about the permaban account. I tried to message the mods but got muted. I know this is ridiculous but I’m completely depressed. It’s been rough dealing with anxiety, depression, self isolation. Having that subreddit, having the comfort of reading doctors answering that whatever I was worried about wasn’t serious, it had the power of reducing anxiety while having a panic attack. I know it’s ridiculous being depressed about it but now I’m feeling even more depressed, more anxious and more alone. I don’t want to go to a psychiatrist because I’m afraid of the effects of medication and psychology isn’t really working don’t know what’s the point of making this post, just venting, sorry for the english, not my first languageAnxiety about permaban from /r/askdocs",1635273792,2091,370
Anxiety,"This is my first time visiting this forum so I don’t really know what type of format the posts on here usually follow.  the age of 11 I migrated with my family to England. I had a miserable childhood here. I never had stable trusted friendships, I was most likely depressed for most of it. As a result of being depressed and sitting at home all the time I developed really bad social anxiety as well as just a general anxiety disorder. I’ve been to three different therapists so far, only one of them gave me a solid diagnosis, if you will, and told me I might be suffering from depression. Last year my panic attacks got so bad that I started failing tests because I couldn’t control my anxiey. I decided to see a therapist and ask them to give me some sort of medication as I felt that I couldn’t handle it anymore. They gave me some mild beta blockers after I literally begged them to do so and promised them not to abuse them. My friend had her ATs this year and she was really stressed about them so she went to see a psychiatrist and got prescribed some meds. Now I hear that my other friend has been diagnosed with GAD and was put on some medication. he is one of the happiest and most cheerful people I know and I’m aware of the fact that you can never know what is going on inside someone’s head because they might be good at hiding it etc. but I am just so fucking pissed that they got treatment so fast. That someone trusted their words and believed them and gave them the help they needed. Like why didn’t that happen to me. Why do I have to prove to everyone that I’m suffering and they don’t have to?It feels like I’ve been screaming for help for YEAR and still barely anyone has heard me and they click their fingers and get treated, have time off school they get sympathy from everyone around them when I have to live being ashamed of the fact that doing every day tasks is difficult for me? know this is more like a rant than a normal post and I’m sorry if I come off as someone who lacks empathy. I would include more explanation as to how I feel about my friends getting diagnosed but unfortunately typing this out took my ages for some reason and I just can’t be bothered with Reddit anymore.Why is life so unfair?",1635273207,2234,427

I’m in my early 20s with no pre-existing medical conditions and I haven’t had anyone close to me pass on but I have crazy anxiety over the thought of death. Just thinking about the topic of death will send me into a downwards spiral. Makes my heart race and makes my head throb. It’s 2am now and the thoughts are just consuming me. anxiety starts when I start to think about my last moments alive - how would the last few seconds before I die be like? Will I just completely cease to exist after death? If there is an afterlife, will I be able to meet my loved ones there? Or does my story end when I die and my soul just disappears? Will I never see my loved ones again after my time on Earth ends? guess the only thing I can takeaway from this fear is to live my life well and cherish the people around me.Debilitating fear of death",1635272344,878,171

Anxiety,"hey guys. Enjoy the ride as I brief you. Ive (22f) been with my partner (22m) for 2.5 years. This has been my first relationship as i grew up in a mentally and physically abusive, broken household. In the beginning, everything felt safe in the way we both loved each other. that attentiveness &amp; teamwork was something i’ve waited to date for, i believe it comes from the lack of attention or safety as a child. i’m a huger lover, i love to give attention and be playful. However, as time as gone on, that attentiveness has slowly diminished. my anxiety tells me it’s because he doesn’t care for me the same way or maybe i’m not as charming as he once thought. I had found out maybe 4 months into the relationship that he had been w someone from our modeling agency before we met and cut her off immediately after. However, at this time is when I had found out that he had messaged her a flirting snapchat while dating. I can’t get this thought to leave me alone, that maybe he wished to pick her. My issue with myself is that I have never been a jealous type, i’d whisk anyone off that wasn’t all for me without a thought before. I feel CRAZY. If i were to see him texting a girl or overlooking a month ago, i’d stir up a huge fight over it. ridiculous. we’re both grown &amp; i should trust him. Is it the lack of affection ive been seeking from him that is making me pick myself apart wondering if i’m good enough? he always reassures me saying he feels comfortable with me now, &amp; maybe he does feel that way. I just am a give all &amp; i struggle to understand those outside of my own feelings.  ive been working on myself reminding myself what my clinical psychologist neighbor told me, that i can’t have control over everything even tho my anxiety wants me to. i don’t want to lose a great man who really does show love in other ways, what is some techniques or advice i can use to better my current anxieties?Anxiety has me ruining my relationship",1635271855,1961,369

I have a hard time making new friends now as I feel as if I constantly need reassurance or else I just fall apart.

Anxiety,"o, in January I stopped going to therapy, since I got significantly better and my therapist suggested that I should now try to function without us meeting every 7 or 14 days, so I can get independent from him, I suppose. But although (after 4 years) I’ve won against my depression, the anxiety has never left. I’ve tried to get used to it (how tf can you do that?), but to no avail.  would say I have been experiencing anxiety since I was around eleven, so it has officially gained the status of the oldest friend of mine. But it hasn’t gone much better and to be honest, I feel like I’ve been thrown onto a landslide these days. a couple of some all right months, there has came a turning point. I’ve failed my maths and I had to take and pass some tests in August to get a promotion to the next class. That’s where I started to experience severe anxiety again. Then, after I passed and went back to school, suddenly there was this enormous amount of new material we had to swot. After that, my now ex boyfriend (I wish him sand in his bedsheets) broke up with me and a group people I called “friends” decided to ghost me.o yeah, some stuff has happened. amidst all of that stands I, questioning whether our worsening mental health and much more frequent anxiety attacks ( I usually have only two in a month, somewhere around my period, thanks, Mother Nature), is enough to go back into therapy. I know I can take more, but it is getting more and more exhausting lately.

Anxiety,"I'm starting to wonder If I even have ADHD. I'm just curious because I was diagnosed with ADHD as a kid, but I don't have every ADHD symptom that are super common like losing things, forgetting appointments, being late (I'm always early for stuff). I do often feel restless though and have problems staying focused on tasks as of now. Throughout my life I've always had trouble staying asleep. It is very common for me to wake up over 4-7 times a night (for no reason I rarely ever have to go to the bathroom more than once in the middle of the night). got diagnosed by some psychiatrist I believe when I was in 3rd grade and back then there wasn't 3 different types of ADHD diagnoses I believe. I believe I would have of had the primary hyperactive and impulsive version. Never had bad grades up to that point was doing perfect in terms of learning, didn't have attention problems at the time, but I was very hyperactive and impulsive. I would blurt out answers if other kids were talking to long to come up with one when it was their turn, and got into some fights on occasion on the playground (no longer hyper active as an adult, but very physically active). Whenever the teachers asks me if I took my Adderall and I said no they would send me home they hated me when I wasn't on it. I hated taking the Adderall as a kid because it turned me into a zombie and made me read super slow compared to my normal self (was on 45 mg per day of IR 30 mg in the morning 15 mg afternoon in Elementary school). I also never wanted to hang out with friends or do anything when it was in my system. now that I'm older I've been back on Adderall. I asked my primary care doctor to put me back on it since I currently have problems staying focused on important things and was diagnosed with ADHD as a kid. I thought maybe it could help me. I started on 10 mg XR and the only thing I noticed was an increase in motivation to finish tasks like house cleaning and laundry from start to finish. I still would finish these things off medication just didn't enjoy doing it as much and often waited longer to start and messed around more. I never noticed an increase in focus or working memory. had a dose increase recently to 30 mg xr and now it's causing irritability, agitation, and reduced focus &amp; working memory vs being off medications. It also gets me buzzed and feels like I'm on speed (opposite effect of what It did to me as a child.) it possible that I just got diagnosed with just hyperactive symptoms and out grew them? I know the inattention symptoms normally don't go away if you always had them. I'm pretty positive I didn't have problems staying focused as a kid. I'm starting to think my inability to stay asleep is causing the focusing issues I have now because I'm always feeling restless (often have racing thoughts to when I'm trying to sleep). eems like restlessness is the only symptom I had as both a child and an adult.Is it possible to get misdiagnosed with ADHD because of anxiety, insomnia, or depression?",1635270227,3019,564

I just finished tapering off them a few weeks ago and had tried Buspar. Also didn't like it and kept forgetting to take it, so I came off of that completely. I'm now unmedicated. the beginning of the month, I started seeing a therapist at my gyno's recommendation to learn how to cope with past traumas and see where they're still affecting me today. We've only had two sessions, but I'm learning a lot about listening to my body - sitting with uncomfortable moments learning what they are. I'm debating how I want to continue treatment. I'm nervous to get back on meds when it's a real crapshoot, takes 4-6 weeks to take effect, and masks a lot of my physical anxiety symptoms. But I've also heard from my previous psych that therapy and medication often go well together to help with progress. I can't help but wonder if I'm missing out if I don't go back on something. Also, the physical symptoms of my anxiety are completely back: anxiety-induced IB, racing heart, etc. My mental state is about the same as it was on meds, though. going to ask my therapist for her opinion (I moved and don't see a psych anymore, it's my primary doc prescribing me new meds).

Anxiety,"Hi first time posting here, will try my best to keep it brief. I've been dealing with GAD since 2015, and since last Monday (oct. 18) I've been on a long anxiety/depression episode. I normally live alone in my appartment, but to get through this episode, I decided to go spend my days at my parent's house, they live close to me, and not being alone during day and evening really helps me. been more than a week now, and I still don't feel ready to go back home by myself yet. I went to see my therapist last week to speak to him about my triggers of this current episode and we worked on it as we always do. I consider this last trigger pretty much dealth with, but I still feel the need to stay, in fear on going back home alone and feeling worse. I'm the type of guy who gets more anxious at the very start of the day and by the evening, will feel better progressively. seeing my therapist again this evening and will talk about this to him, but would like to have you guys' opinion. thing that's still bugging me is that, the last 2 days, about 30 mins before my bed time, I had a vision of me finally going back home and I felt good about it, but every new morning, the anxiety would come back and I feel like it's a infinite loop and I won't be able to come back home soon. thing is, i'm a very lazy person in everyday's life, and I really need to clean up my appartment because it was pretty dirty when I left to my folk's house, and pretty much everything is spoiled in my fridge, meaning that I also need to clean/empty it and go do a lot of groceries shopping. here's what I'm wondering regarding all that, am I doing the right thing, staying with my folks until I really feel like my real self again and feeling ready to go through all those chores at home, or should I just kick my ass a little and force myself home to clear this up?Fear of going back home",1635261878,1869,367

Anxiety,"Trigger warning, this post mentions suicide but no large discussion on it. guys, so for years I had been dealing with anxiety and was officially diagnosed a few years ago. I have been dealing with intrusive thoughts a lot and I believe I may have a bit of depression which haven't been diagnosed yet. Lately, on the days where I mostly get my intrusive thoughts, the words ""I hate myself"" or ""I wish I were dead"" goes through my head and then I start having my usual intrusive thoughts that cause me distress. Now, suicide isn't something I would act upon but how can I distinguish the thoughts that are intrusive? Also, is repeating I hate myself and I want to die something that usually happens with depression? I have no idea anymore. I'm going to therapy to work on my anxiety which is helping. I don't take medication either. Using that as a last resort.

Anxiety,"o I've been struggling with anxiety for about a year now and recently I've come to a certain realization that has become one possible solution to anxiety, and this solution is three simple words ""You don't know"", let me explain. You see, most of my current anxiety comes from either the thought of ""what bad thing could happen tomorrow?"" Or ""what is this person thinking about me?"", and the answer to both of these questions could be the solution to your anxiety which is that YOU DONT KNOW. My therapist always told me that whenever anxious thoughts arise in my head, I should do my best to at least ""fight back"" after a few minutes in order to prevent or stop a panic attack and in my opinion this solution could be one form of ""counterattack"" to anxiety. Everyone's life is different and mostly UNPREDICTABLE, so why bother thinking about what could happen tomorrow if there is no possible way to know that? Why bother thinking about what other people think if  everyone is different and has their own flaws. Personally, most my anxiety comes from negative expectations from the world and I feel that the phrase, ""You dont know"" is something that I can repeat daily in order to counteract these expectations that cause some of my suffering. This solution is a work in progress so feel free to add certain suggestions that could help improve it. Also if you disagree with this solution please provide the reasons why so that I can also further improve this solution. Hopefully this helps!! Good luck to you all and God Bless!""You dont know"" a possible solution to anxiety",1635256500,1573,277

I'll do my best, but please forgive me for any ignorance/assumptions/etc.) keep it as short as possible my partner suffers from extreme panic attacks with some/all of the following symptoms: (Usually happens while falling asleep but very occasionally in loud or busy public spaces) has the symptoms I would expect such as Difficulty breathing, communicating, etc Increased heart rate and shaking oftentimes she will start with those symptoms and things get worse the longer the panic attack lasts. For example, she has a wide range of very specific auditory hallucinations quite commonly. he will think I said something bad to her, or she will hear a family member's voice yelling when they’re not there. he also describes an extremely loud constant noise and she will sometimes start hitting her head and ears. Most of the time she also is unable to hear me at this point, even when looking directly at me and trying to understand me.  top of this, she sometimes will essentially 'pass out' depending on the severity of the last section. he will sometimes suddenly collapse. I was told that this was the body protecting itself and it was perfectly fine but it still worries me and I can’t imagine it’s healthy long term.  know she has had a rough past, and I’m not trying to dig into that too much or figure out why this is happening. I just want to know if anyone has any advice or insight on how to help her and make things better when things are getting really severe for her. it's gotten to this point I’ve gone with her to see a mental health professional twice and got some relatively effective solutions.

Anxiety,"Anxiety has been messing with my sleep on and off for the last 2 years, at first when my anxiety kicked into full it was making me sleep all the time, and then not letting me sleep at all. I was taking melatonin for a while but stopped because it was giving me weird dreams and causing me some stomach issues in the mornings (well, that and anxiety I'm sure). though I've been having this weird thing \*every\* single night. It goes like this - I go to bed around 11:30, I lay there and defuse my anxiety thoughts for a bit and then usually I can fall asleep pretty quickly, within a half hour or so. Then without fail, every single morning at 5:00 almost exactly I wake up having to go to the bathroom. After that I come back to bed and try to sleep, but only manage to get to sleep for another 40 mins or so before I have to pee again, then I come back to bed and about 40 mins later it's the same thing, at that point I usually just stay up for the day. get me wrong 5ish hours of sleep is an improvement over my previous situation, but I'm not getting enough sleep and I'm not sure what else I can do, I was wondering if anybody has had this sort of thing happen and if they had any advice?

It was my mom, angry that my step mother had snuck out the house in the middle of the night to buy drugs ( she does this when stressed) she's suppose to be in recovery but her phases of recovery don't last long. The person she tried to get the drugs from messaged my mother that they were trying to get clean themselves and turn there life around and told my mom that she wants her and my step mom to stay the fuck out her life. (my mother isn't a addict more of an enable that tolerates to much) mom was already stressed about possible cancer but this sent her over the emotional edge, she started going off about how it's unfair she always has to do everything and be the responsible on in the relationship and that now that she might be dying my step mother isn't supporting her and is running around thinking about herself. My mom then cursed my step mother out. step mother told my mom she can't control who she hangs out with and she can't be angry because recovery is difficult. Then asked for there wedding ring back. The thing is she's been doing this off and on for 21 years, and hasn't worked or helped support the family during that timeframe my mother has always supported her. had to stop listening at this point, because there was nothing I could do to help, my mother doesn't like telling me about this sort of stuff, and gets angry when I ask. all happened 30mins ago and there is still stomping and my mother having a emotional meltdown upstairs. a very anxious and depressed person, and my therapist cant see me for another week. o I've been spending the last few days in bed when not working and just sinking into a depression worrying about my mother. What should I do? I feel so awful.My mother might have Colon cancer",1635249507,1945,366
Anxiety,"I suffer from anxiety worse than most...or so I thought...because whenever I chat to people they seem to mention their anxiety in a way that seems severe as well.  instance yesterday my group had to give a speech to the class; I had some nerves beforehand and felt a bit queasy and all, but today I found out all my group members felt the same way and one of them had a panic attack before. recently found out my best friend suffers from anxiety and takes medication  girl I had a date with a few weeks ago said she needed to have some drinks before our date because she was so anxious  people who I see as being fearless and confident have disclosed that they doubt themselves and my friends brother who's a motivational speaker said he still needs to take beta blockers sometimes to calm his nerves before he gives a speech.  also know a magistrate who regularly vomits from nervousness before they have a court session, and my cousin who's in a metal band freaks out when he has to play live  got me thinking...does anxiety only become problematic when it stops you from functioning significantly? Is it only worth medicating if it's at this level? Is anxiety just rife throughout society these days?What amount of anxiety is 'normal' to experience in day to day life?",1635248925,1271,228

Anxiety,"I am a normally anxious person I would say, about many different situations and many different things. I manage to deal with it okay most the time. It stops me from doing somethings and I know it is something to work on. Recently however I have discovered a situation that gives me a lot of anxiety, like to the point where I can't even think straight start trembling, have trouble breathing camly, my body tenses, my stomach gets upset etc. The situation is drinking and parties, not me drinking or going to parties but people I know. One person I know doesn't go to parties that often, doesn't even drink that often and if they do it's usually at their own place just with their friends but anytime they drink alcohol I can't help but worry crazilt about them. They are an adult and I know it is a normal thing for adults to do but I can't help but be anxious. I'm worried the alcohol will make them do something they wouldn't do normally, or they will get taken advantage of or hurt. I can't even see parties on TV shows anymore because it triggers these thoughts. I know I can't stop them from drinking, they don't have a problem with it, they drink sensibly and are never alone or anything but yeah I can't help but get these crazy worries. They have a work party coming up soon where they will drink a little and I'm just wondering if anyone has any advice on how I can better manage the anxiety so I amnt crazy worrying the whole night when they are there?Really appreciate any advice or techniques on managing the anxiety. Doesn't have to be specific to this situation just thought I would give some background to help. ThanksHow to cope with anxiety about a situation?",1635248405,1677,309

Anxiety,"I (19F) have been working at a dentist for a month now. It's my first job ever and a social one at that. When I graduated from school, I feared that my anxiety would get in my way so much that I wouldn't be able to work at all. But surprisingly, it's not nearly as bad as I thought. was so scared of working before, but it's been going pretty smoothly. And against my expectations, having to work with people actually helps me a lot. At least that's what I've noticed so far. Talking to strangers is still scary and I'll keep it to a minimum, but at least I don't stumble around my words as much as I used to. I do sweat a lot. My palms are pretty much always sweaty when I'm at work and recently a coworker discretely informed me that I smell sweaty. I've been self-conscious about it ever since, but I'm still thankful she told me. thing I do have to work on is my anxiety during sessions. Especially when I have to assist my boss. he likes to ask questions while working and I'm so nervous that I blank out completely. Even though I know the answer to most questions. And when coworkers watch me while doing easy tasks, I get so nervous that I even mess those up. so frustrating. I don't want to be an inconvenience to others, but I just can't help it.

Anxiety,"When Covid pandemic started, my city has been stuck by earthquake. I got PTD and crippling anxiety came with it.  With it, I realized how anxious I was my whole life but I always thought it was just regular ''worry'' everyone experiences.  In August I had my first depressive episode which lasted about 3 weeks and it was only then I realized that I really needed help.  went to my doctor, got some blood test done (all fine, it's not an organic problem) she send me to psychologist. I went there with a typical ''I don't want meds, it gonna make me a zombie'' stigma.  he took a whole hour to explain to me how it works, how my body and mind gave up after more than year and a half and that there is probably chemicals imbalance in my brain and this would help me. At the end of the session, I asked her to give the meds to me. got RI meds, and holy sh\*\*, it made my life so so much better after only 10 days! I wake up in a good mood, I am more concentrated, less anxious and just physically not tense anymore. Of course, it did not solve all of my problems, I'm starting CB therapy next week and it will take a lot of work to learn how to handle my anxiety. It did not make me a zombie, if anything, I was a zombie before it!  I'm actually observe how crippling anxiety took over my life, how it took a toll on my work performance, how I would snap on people without any reason at all and so on. I take time to play with my dog, before I was just not in the mood.  sharing my experience not only here but IRL because there is a huge misunderstanding about meds and what they do to you and about mental health in general. Please note that same meds may not work for you, for some they don't work at all. It has been a struggle for first 10 days - nausea, constipation, extreme physically anxiety (due to your body being used to being in that state), yawning, burst of energy out of nowhere and worst of all - muscle ache, especially shoulders. after a month (they say you need to take them for at least 30 days to get them to properly work) I am happy, less anxious and in a state of shock that I left myself go trough it for more than a year and a half.  was/is your journey on the meds?I started anxiety meds and it has been the best decision of my life",1635237440,2259,446

For me having my breath restricted is a HUGE trigger. Especially if it goes longer than an hour.  have to fly to see family for Xmas and I need a mask that has the lightest touch, restricts the least amount of air and one I can barely feel on my face.  I know this is going to be Upsetting to some of you. I am fully vaxxed. I will get that 3rd shot the second I can. I just really need some relief here. I am really careful to not put anyone at risk. Also me with a light mask is going to be far less of a danger than that one asshole on my plane that’s never gonna put his mask on unless someone asks over and over. And he’s probably not vaxxed at all any way.  other option is to self medicate if the anxiety crosses a line. I’ve got 4 months clean and I’m doing so good. I really don’t want to go down that path.

Anxiety,"This is something I’ve wanted to talk about for a long time but didn’t quite know how to phrase… and I still don’t. I’ll start by prefacing that I’m not anti- marijuana and I have smoked many, many time before. Before it was legal I would buy from dealers or get it from friends. I never had an awful time while I was high but didn’t love it either. I didn’t smoke everyday but probably a few times a month. When I got to college, it became legal. Therefore, I started smoking legal, government weed. Now those highs were scary. I would feel like I was dying, I would have panic attacks and dissociate from my body. But I kept doing it because sometimes it was ok and hell, everyone else was doing it. In my second year of college, the pandemic started. To destress, me and some of my friends smoked some government controlled weed from a dispensary. We started playing monopoly and then, I lost it. I looked in the mirror and I didn’t know who I am. I was convinced I would be high forever. Nothing felt real. I grabbed a friend and she helped calm me down until the high wore off. A few days later I went to a restaurant with some friends. I was sober but something felt off. Nothing seemed real. I was too in tune with the music and peoples conversations. My friends seemed like actors, like I didn’t really know them. I went to the bathroom and cried. I was silent for the rest of the night. I had no idea what happened. After that I was fine for a while. The pandemic sent us all back to our hometowns and I was happy to see my boyfriend again. He lived 30 mins away from me in the next town over. I would often drive the highway there and had no problem with it before. But the same thing happened on the highway that happened in the restaurant. But worse. I was driving and everything looked fake. The clouds looked like paintings and ever field looked like the one before. I did not recognize where I was, even though I had been there many times before. Then I had my first real panic attack. My chest started to hurt and all my limbs went numb. I felt like I couldn’t breathe and I was sweating up a storm. I pulled over and start crying. People drove by looking at me like I was crazy. And I sure as hell felt it. I had no idea what had happened and thought I was going insane. I told no one. I feared they would put me in a hospital. But it kept happening. Eventually I had no choice but to tell my parents. I went to a doctor and he gave me some anti anxiety medicine. They made me feel even worse, like I was constantly in a dream. I got off those meds pretty quick and started therapy. My therapist used the word “derealization.” I had never heard it before but it felt nice to know that others had experienced what I did. I started having these “episodes” as I call them, everywhere. At work, out and about, even in my own house. No where felt safe. I had to quit my job, I mostly stopped driving, and I stopped doing the things I love. I saw more therapists and more doctors and was given more meds. Eventually I found a medicine that seemed to mostly work. I still have episodes every once in a while, but that’s just counting the big ones. Pretty much every time I leave the house or sometimes even just my room it takes me around an hour to adjust to my surroundings before the brain fog lifts. And sometimes it doesn’t. It’s never been as bad as the time on the highway, but I mostly never feel real. I feel pain and I feel emotion but my head gets heavy and I start to sweat and I fear that this place, this world is unsafe, that its not real and I’m not real and everything is nothing. I pray for an end to it all everyday. I think it would be better to be dead but I know deep down the my real fear is not being here, therefore making death not an option of escape. For now I just float. I float through life trying to ignore what’s in my head and the signals my body gives me when it thinks I’m in danger at the produce aisle of obeys. I dream of the girl I once was. I was carefree and stressed about small things like the boy from the bar not answering my napchat. Now I fear insanity. And I fear that might be the one real thing in my life. But I have no other option then to try new meds, new breathing techniques, name 5 things I can see and so on. I want to be happy, and I lot of times I am. But it’s so hard to be actually happy when you don’t even know what’s real.I am not a doctor, and I will never be a doctor. But after doing my own research I think marijuana is the one to blame. Those highs took me to a new dimension, straight out of a horror movie. I believe that to be my trauma. Now I see my friends smoking daily without an issue and wonder how long before the episodes hit them too, that is if ever. I wonder why no one talks about this side effect? I’ve seen hundreds on social media share the same story but no government advertising share this risk. And I know this is not a risk for everyone, but how about the hundreds it is? Weed should be legal, but not like this.I believe it ruined my life and I would not wish this experience on my worst enemy.But for now, I float.My short story about anxiety, depression, and derealization",1635222757,5179,1017

Anxiety,"I really think people underestimate the power of a trigger. When you truly have a specific trigger and you experience it, it cripples you instantly. I only have 1 trigger and it’s a song that reminds of a painful memory about the health of 1 of my parents. It shakes me to my core because the song was playing in a moment when I truly thought I was going to lose my parent and be an orphan. I was laying in bed and rolled over about to go to sleep and i could hear my roommate listen to that song on TikTok and the sudden flood of painful memories was overwhelming. I sobbed for 10 minutes. I tried deep breathing for a while before I could get it to ease up. Triggers aren’t something trendy to talk about or joke about. They aren’t just a little warning on a Facebook picture. They are very real and can bring on incredible pain for someone in a moments notice. I don’t get offended at much but when people joke about triggers I think that it undermines the severity of a true trigger with someone who has experienced a traumatic event.Don’t be the a**hole who jokes about being tRiGgErEd",1635221577,1090,206
Anxiety,"I don’t know what to do. I identify patterns and problems all the time but never have solutions. Neither do my therapists.Here’s one of my problems that’s really bugging me right now. My mind isn’t my own. There’s two aspects to this.1. People will constantly stay on my mind, and it stops me from being able to do things. Go clean my room, do my homework. I can’t do them cause I have an imaginary person watching everything I do, think, and even the way I move.2. Number 1 usually happens when I’m alone. 2 happens when I’m anywhere other than alone in my room. If I’m out in the family room on the couch, out on a walk, out at school, I feel like everyone is watching me. Even if I’m walking out in nature completely alone. It feels like there is a crowd of people watching everything I’m doing, thinking, and even the way I move. These things make it impossible to get anything done, or even to walk, or even to IT anywhere outside of my room. Again I have identified a problem that stops me from doing the simplest things but I can’t do anything to stop it.I had to stop walking tonight cause it was too much. I was all alone though of course. I’m so lost.My mind isn’t my own",1635221233,1181,226

Anxiety,"First of all I want to apologize to anyone who reads this entire summary of my life I know its all over the place like tarantino film but Id be very thankful to hear from anyone really I recently put down drinking about a week ago after drinking a minimum of 6 beers daily for the past 3 years. I tried quitting in the past but to no success, as soon I attempted to quit within 3 days of quitting I would feel like a low grade fever would be coming in and only relief by drinking more. I also recently quit smoking after 9 years which I will elaborate more further in this post. week I made the decision I wanted to improve my health after many warnings from my family. Exactly what kind of warnings? My family kept stressing that they knew people of my age who passed away from blood clots/heart attacks awhile back and they worry that my sedentary lifestyle and overall health puts me at a huge risk. Reasonable enough.  of right now I haven't drank any alcohol in the last 8 days and I feel like crap. tension headaches, neck stiffness, hot flashes, back pain a burning/stabbing chest pain that comes and goes briefly (thankfully no shortness of breath unless I get a panic attack), and some indigestion. I do want to note that I have many medical conditions that have been diagnosed by doctors in the past that I will list below and a few of these symptoms existed prior to quitting but they have been greatly amplified after I quit drinking/smoking. I continue I do want to add that Im 5'8"", weight is approximately 275lbs and am 23yo hispanic male. I suffer from scoliosis (12° curving) might be worse now as my last x-ray was 4 years ago and then I didnt have as much chronic back pain as I do now, so I have terrible posture and as I gain more weight the more trouble I have trying to fix my posture. I also suffer from GERD(acid reflux) and have general/social anxiety simply making eye contact with some people can trigger it. the past I've felt everything Im feeling today when I was first diagnosed with my medical conditions nearly 4 years ago. I was advised to lose weight and at the time my weight was 254lbs when I was 19yo and in 4 months I managed to lose 52lbs and almost all my troubles went away but I wasn't an alcoholic then and had temporarily quit smoking because I had anxiety and smoking would just amplify it even more.  did take me nearly 3 years to gain the intial 52lbs I lost + 23lbs, so my weight loss program was legit but it didn't take into consideration alcoholism where I would drink up to 900 extra calories per day depending on what beverage I picked plus late night Doordash orders +1,500 calories more on cheeseburgers. started my same regiment I did many years ago and in just a week I felt a burst of energy, I get better sleep now when my neck isn't stiff-like at night but my anxiety has gone berserk, my assumption is I have too much psychological stress. I cut alcohol off after years of abuse and originally I did not want to give up smoking because it makes me really anxious when I stop but I had to give it up the other day(10/23) because I noticed that after a brief smoke break I had a burning sensation on my chest, shortness of breath, and thigh/feet spasms it all went away after 30 minutes or so. I also easily cut about 1k-2k calories per day by not drinking or getting munchies which that itself can be very taxing on the body especially the brain. do know that since I put down both drinking and smoking my body will temporarily feel overwhelmed during this detoxing period. last time I felt like this or better yet the first time I felt like this I was going in and out of the ER because I felt like I was having a heart attack every other day but as mentioned it was GERD and Anxiety the whole time. o applying past experiences I assumed as much, and since ER bills tend to get really expensive, and doctors hit you with that ""your wasting my time on actual patients that really need help"". Right now the way I see it is if I dont feel very overwhelmed I will not go to the ER. I did schedule a physical/blood work for tomorrow as a preventative measure incase something is up. Mostly incase if I turned Diabetic as, I had a bad habit of fasting up to 16 hours every day so I could drink alcohol before my very first meal so I can buzz hard on it really sucks because my Anxiety, GERD, coliosis all give a similar chest tightness/stabbing/pressure. Ive amatuerly tested my cardiac health by jogging a 1/4 mile and felt no angina, which it was something my aunt would get( she had bad heart valve) she couldn't even go check the mail without feeling chest pain and shortness of breath,(dont worry she had surgery and is doin okay) so I do find some relief knowing that exercise does not cause my chest pain but unfortunately my anxiety dominates my mind.(Also my aunt is not blood related so no heart conditions run in the family but diabetes does on both sides) I wrote this I had an anxiety attack and I just jogged in place, did some jumping jacks and squats and just like that my anxiety went down a bit(no more pains as of right now)  guess what I really want is to hear your stories, people of reddit, I desire to hear if you had a similar experiences so I do not feel alone in these mildly trying times, again.  I do want to add that just over a year ago I had a car accident, hit a curb at 70mph and my seat belt (thankfully I had one), hooked up around my gut and bruised me up pretty bad. After the bruising went away I noticed a lump, likely a hernia but I never got it checked out and it disappeared or I probably got fatter but either way I think its somewhat crucial information. worry I don't get triggered, I will gladly accept constructive criticism especially if I could really use it.

Anxiety,"Hope all is well.. It's been roughly a year since my anxiety and stress has been present. It's become such a normalcy now, that when I don't have anxiety, I get anxiety about not having anxiety. I've tried multiple medications which never helped and I've done meditation and tried sticking to a routine. One of my biggest problems that I face is that driving is now one of my least favorite things to do. I used to love driving all over the place, but now it gives me such anxiety that I have blocked it out of my mind as something I would normally do. I'm really worried and stressed out that I won't ever be able to drive like I did before I started having these problems. I really miss the feeling of driving and liking it. I don't know why it gives me such anxiety which bothers me as well. It's almost as if I get over whelmed and my brain can't process everything that's happening. Unfortunately I don't have the money to get a vehicle at the moment while I'm in college but I'd really like to get one just to drive short distances. I feel like less of a man that I get massive anxiety when driving and I really want to know what exactly is causing it.

Anxiety,"Ever since I was a child I have had these feelings. Which makes me even more scared that I will feel this way forever. I apologize if this is negative or affects anyone else. But I hope I can relate to other people or possibly get some tips.  up I always felt like I needed to fix everything around me. Like it was my fault or responsibility. My mother has bipolar disorder and my father who I lived with full time had a girlfriend who later became his wife. he helped raise me since I was 2. But she was very hard on me especially when he wasn't around. I am thankful for her as she taught me a lot, don't get me wrong. But I was always trying to prove myself to her for some reason. Looking for validation, but in her eyes, I could always do better. They later had a child together and he was awful to me and they did nothing about it. I would get equal blame. He would attack me, bang my head against the wall or chase me with a knife when they weren't home. But since he was young when this was happening (5-11 yr) they did not take it seriously and like I said, I would take the blame as well for ""reacting"" to him. I'm sorry, but I did not understand why my own family member would do this to me, nor did I want it to continue or escalate. But I was the drama queen who was overreacting or ""playing the victim"". My father worked night shifts, at night his gf would call her mother as most people do to rant. he would talk about me and how I always play the victim and cause all this trouble. When all I ever wanted was for someone to love and appreciate me for who I am, and not try to change me all the time. But I believed her. I am the problem. I cause all this drama in the household. he and my dad would get in fights constantly, ATLEAT twice a week. A lot of the time it was because of me. ometimes my dad would try and stick up for me because he saw how hard she was on me. But she is always right, there's no getting through to this woman. They would scream at each other and throw things. I would hide in my closet, that's where I felt safe. Not that they would hurt me, I just hated when they did this. But for some reason, it was normalized. Just a normal occurrence in our home. I believe that's why my brother treated me the way he did. He doesn't know how to show love. Nor did my feelings ever get validated of being scared, he wouldn't get a serious talking to, explaining how that makes people feel. I just needed to ""grow up"". To this day I do not know how to give or receive love. I am scared of letting anyone in. I am very independent. No close friends, I do everything alone. I like this, but I wish I knew how to be myself around people. I always overthink everything when I am around people. I push people away before we get close. My mother says I have abandonment issues... I don't know what it is but I want it to stop. I'm sick of feeling alone, and not trusting anyone. I want to be happy. I want to be loved. I want to enjoy my life. But for some reason, I constantly analyze my surroundings for danger or red flags. I do this to everyone I meet and every situation I am in. There's so much more that I believe influences these feelings I have, like my father being a first responder and occasionally hearing horror stories of people getting hurt. He tries to keep us safe but I ended up fearing everything. conclusion... Does anyone else feel a constant fear of simply existing? Like at any moment the world could end, or a murderer could come into my house and kill my family. Or someone is going to get cancer that I love. These are all things that happen to people on the daily, yet we keep on living. Like these horrible things don't just happen to people every single day.... I want to enjoy my life before I worry it away. If anything is going to kill me its the amount of stress I feel.  are some things to look forward to in life? What keeps people motivated to live? I am not suicidal, although I often wonder if I'd be better off. But I would never put my family through that. I just don't know how to be happy. It's almost like I don't allow myself to be happy. Like there are too many horrible things going on or that could happen.... this is all over the place... I just needed to get that out I think.Scared of living",1635217523,4268,842

Anxiety,"Hi friends :) so a lot of my anxiety issues began around when I was 16, largely linked to an abusive relationship and a very toxic friendship.  won’t go into much detail, but one night I was with both the boyfriend and friend and her purse went missing. he seemed to think it was the boyfriend, but I honestly had no idea what had happened.  few months later a lot of drama went down and we were no longer friends. It was around this time that the abusive boyfriend revealed to me that he had stolen the purse and thrown it in a random trash can. I was appalled and had no idea what to do. I wasn’t close with the friend anymore, in fact she had become a horrible bully to me. I was too terrified to speak to her again so I never came clean, but I did pressure the boy to do so. He never did. We thankfully ended things soon after.  been a few years now and this still weighs on me. I know I didn’t do it and he should be the one who feels awful, but I can’t help but beat myself up for not telling her.

Normally I wouldn't care so much but I had been reading a lot of blogs and articles talking about how only alpha males feel they can treat beta males like this without consequence, so now I feel in turn like a huge beta male and thus completely unattractive to women ever since I broke off that friendship. I've even been having a bunch of fantasies of getting revenge against him for this reason too, I know getting an assault charge would just ruin my life further and I'd never act on it but after having read all those articles about alpha male / beta male dynamics I've had this urge to restore primal justice for two years that I just can't let go of in my mind.  huge reason why it's so hard to just 'let it go' is because I have this deep fear in my mind that if any woman were ever to have witnessed how he had treated me sometimes, they would feel an attraction to HIM, whereas I was in turn a pathetic wimpy beta male who didn't know how to stand up for himself, and it wouldn't have mattered that I've had plenty of romantic experience with women both in and out of relationships, my attractiveness to them has been destroyed by this abusive one sided friendship, end of story, he wins, there's no recourse for me and any woman I ever come across now can probably sense my sense of self has been destroyed from putting myself in this toxic friendship.Can't get over a toxic asshole friend from 2 and a half years ago",1635209636,1617,304

Anxiety,"Have any of you had these? I've read that generally they are mostly indistinct noises. estranged mother who is currently living with us for a couple more months (me and my grandparents) is someone i do not get along with. I want all the best for her, i just don't want her in my life.  suffers from extreme depression and bipolar, and there have been many nights where I've heard her crying/sobbing.  that triggers my anxiety like a mofo... a result, i often think i hear her crying (I'm downstairs she stays upstairs). It's always just quiet enough that i can't be sure, but just loud enough that it pecks my subconscious mind and i feel my anxiety growing without knowing why. Then as the anxiety is building, i suddenly consciously notice the sound and I get a massive twinge of guilt and extreme anxiety.  i sit super still and quiet, i try to listen to see if that is indeed her crying.  Almost every time, it isn't.  In fact  every time it isn't,  but since I've heard her cry before, my mind goes to that. My grandpa watches tv right above my room, and that's what the noise is. I've gone upstairs mutliple times to make sure.  just the volume it's at and the way it permeates the walls, the pitch of it resembles her crying and gives me MAIVE anxiety.  Mixed with anger and sadness of course.  anyone else have an experience like this? When i was younger living with my parents, I'd often get massive anxiety just hearing their voices when they'd drink and i waa trying to fall asleep so I'm sure that PTD plays into this quite a bit.

For years I’ve been able to manage these feeling but in recent times I feel like they are just getting stronger. I’m constantly smoking weed which I really need to relax on and I drink a whole lot more coffee than I really should. I know it can cause anxiety such as CH or the coffee just being coffee in general I’m trying to ween myself from myself from these habits because I really want a sense of reality back and those feeling of being in daze really make me anxious as well.

Anxiety,"He quit his job and started drinking for about 7 years and fights with my mother since she was born or at least I have memory. Every fight makes me worse, and not to mention the big ones when they start hitting or insulting non-stop and more than once they put me in that fight, every time they fight I always have to interfere because I am afraid that my mother will get hurt or break something important to me like my internet.  my internet I have all my friends and true family, they are always there and listen to me when I feel that I am just going to explode and finally cut off my arm or others, still my father who does not even know them always says that they are not my family or that they are bad people when they have given me a great contribution more than him. Before, I just had to stand in front of them so that they began to calm down, now I have to shout insult and look like them so that they listen to me, all these fights and interferences that I do only hurt me more and more to the point that I really don't want to move on anymore Now I am much more aggressive and easier to get angry, any loud sound like hit or scream I just can't stand it, every time I get nervous or some strong feeling I start to shake with very little control of when to stop.  time I interact less with friends, every time I get tired of doing anything, every time I just want to cry and hope that the night never ends because at least then I will know that when I wake up my father is not here.  again we had a fight and it almost became a strong one and something that I thought I never wanted to do or think about but, I am having suicidal thoughts. I don't want to do it just for my friends on the internet but having them alone scares me and worries what will be next, I'm not old enough to leave home or something I'm just stuck here until something happens.I hate my father and I will like some help (Sorry for bad English or whatever, I use a translator because I speak another language and I don't know where else to post this and some friend said I could do it here )",1635202161,2075,416

Anxiety,"This year has been a tough one for me. I have been feeling very burned out and overwhelmed by my work. I work at a small nonprofit where I’m the only full time staff, which means I do the work of 2-3 people. Im also getting married in a few weeks, which sounds great but in reality it has been a big source of drama with my family where we have nasty fights once or twice a month over really small things. I’ve also been dealing with a weird health problem this past year which seems to me stems from my anxiety. started last winter when I woke up one morning with a nasty cough. The kind that would have me coughing out my lungs anytime I stood up from the bed. Medication barely seemed to help and the only things that temporarily stopped it were cough drops and hot tea. cough gradually went away as it got warmer in the spring but now it’s back again with a vengeance since it got cold again. Throughout this time I have been seeing countless doctors and doing lots of health tests and they have found nothing wrong with me. Although I’m glad they did not find anything terrible, the tests have piled on medical debt which has caused more stress and the doctors are unable to prescribe anything that would help with the cough until they can properly diagnose me. anyone experienced anything similar? I’m really worried this is all caused by my anxiety because I have noticed the cough get worse after a stressful event. I have also experienced something similar when I was in college but it was not this severe and would go away after a couple weeks instead of lasting almost an entire year. you have experienced something similar, what has helped you get over it? At this point, I feel like a month long vacation would solve all of my problems but I feel like I can only take off one week at a time at most.

Anxiety,"I struggle with anxiety and a few other comorbid disorders. Because of this, I'm very bad at saying no to people, even when I need to. It hasn't been a huge issue until today, when it had financial repercussions. Help?  stopped by Walmart to pick up a few things- just a corkboard and some pens. While there, a woman with a small child approached me and asked me to help her buy some milk for her baby. I said yes. he took me to the aisle and picked up one 16 ounce container of the milk mix, then looked at me and put two more in the cart. I was already starting to get a bit uncomfortable, since the three mixes instead of one already equaled $100. he then put some sort of humidifier accessory and a box of diapers in the cart. Her son picked up a Paw Patrol bedding set and tried to get me to buy that as well, but I declined. We got to the register and the total was $173. he spoke broken English and my panish is rusty, so I tried to politely explain to her that I'm a college student and don't exactly operate off of a lot of money + still needed to buy groceries later on in the week, so I would buy whatever was needed the most, but I couldn't afford all of it. he ended up putting two of the containers of milk mix back, which still left the bill at $100. I didn't say anything else, just put it on my credit card and resolved to work overtime this week.  to an extent, this is on me for being 23 and having no idea how expensive baby supplies were. I realize that. I don't regret helping her, though I did get a bit suspicious near the end when she didn't tell her son to put the bedding back, just looked at me to see if I'd buy it for him. I struggle with saying no out of fear of coming across as cruel and that people will think less of me or assume I have bad intentions. It's paralyzing at the worst of times, like today. Does anyone have advice for saying no? I don't expect this happening, but please don't come at me for being not generous or whatever the case may be.

Anxiety,"Title says it all. I was called into a work meeting with just me and my three managers. I had no clue what it was about until I got there.  turns out that they were upset about what had happened that last Thursday. Before work my dog managed to get a hold on one of my pill bottles and started eating them. I immediately got him in the car and took him to the vet, not thinking about anything else. Don't worry, the dog is ok. He's still a happy puppy. wasn't until I was in the waiting room that I remembered my shift in a few hours so I messaged one of my managers and told them what was going on. I then sent a message out to all of my coworkers asking if anyone could cover. Nobody could, but I couldn't leave my dog at the vet alone, so I told my managers that I couldn't make it and I couldn't find anyone to cover. I thought that was it. of a sudden Friday they told me they wanted to meet with me. They didn't say why, even after I asked, just that it had to be after the weekend. I was worried about it all weekend. I got into the meeting today and they were telling me that I needed to keep them more informed and updated on Thursday. Even though my dog was in the vet and I didn't know if he would be ok so all of my attention was on him. I started crying and having the anxiety attack. It lasted an hour, everyone just repeating themselves over and over again until I just shut down and couldn't bring myself to speak no matter how hard I tried. gave me a piece of paper and asked me to sign it to signify that I understood what to do in the future during my job.

Anxiety,"I’ve been hesitant to share this story of my struggle with my ridiculous brain with others for too long. It felt too personal and too embarrassing for a very long time. Now, I need to get better, and that’s why I’ve decided to just let that shit out in the open as part of my recovery.Well, it started at a very early age. I remember I was 8 and we had a science class and chronic diseases were the topic that day. The teacher taught us about Cancer, AID, Hepatitis and other diseases that I don’t remember, but only one of those stuck to my head like a 3M scotch tape. That day I went home so terrified.I got home and went straight to my room and started to try and spot symptoms. “Are my eyes emerging out of their sockets? Am I pale? Yes I definitely have it! That explains why I’m so skinny.” I thought I had AID. I was fucking 8 years old! Eventually, I got over it, for a while at least. has been my life ever since. Hearing/reading about any disease for half a second was enough for my brain to believe that I’ve contracted it (even if it’s not actually contagious) and that my life was over. Every couple of weeks there’s a new panic attack that lasts for another couple of weeks. you don’t have hypochondria you might be thinking “It doesn’t make any sense. Just grow up and get over it”. You don’t think I know that? You think I take pleasure in torturing myself? I know it’s irrational and I know it sounds childish but damn it, it’s real and it doesn’t seem to be going anywhere. consumes you. It exhausts you, mentally and physically. It prevents you from enjoying anything. It has has a crippling effect on your productivity. It makes you forget what basic sensations feel like. If you’re just tired? Oh shit I’m sick. You have a headache? Brain tumor. You have a stomachache (Even if you just had to use the bathroom)? Cancer. Has gas cramps? That’s a stroke for sure. This is your life with it and it’s quite a terrible one. loss of a loved one makes you either completely careless about your health everything, or worsens your fear and anxiety like never before. For me, it was the second case when I lost my father 2 years ago. I became terrified of something happening to the people I care about or for me, but being worried is fine and it makes you more cautious. Hypochondria on the other is an entirely different scenario.I can’t even count the times I have went to the ER in the past couple of years, none of those times have I trusted a diagnosis no matter how conclusive it was. I say to myself “I’m sure the doctor’s not experienced enough” or maybe “he didn’t look at my Xray close enough” and that type of shit.o why am I rambling on about this on here? Well, eventually I got sick and tired of this and decided to get better. Maybe I can’t afford therapy just yet (because it’s ridiculously expensive in the U) but the internet helped me a lot. I took Cognitive Behavioral Therapy courses (CBT), meditated, read motivating stories and listened to a lot of podcasts about health anxiety. I’m nowhere near recovered but I’m slightly better than I used to be because I decided to just not sit here and take it. I’m going to try group counseling (although I may have to travel for at least 2 hours to get to the nearest class) but I’m absolutely willing to do that because I’m O FUCKING ICK OF MYELF.This was just me venting out here since no one really knows who I am. Even if no one reads this, it still felt good to let it out instead of having it eat me alive. You should try it.

Anxiety,"Back in early 2009 maybe, my anxiety had been at pretty high levels (in my early 20s) and a family member (MD) started dispensing me like a half of a low dose alprazolam each day. I don’t know the dosage but probably 0.25mg. It made me feel better for an hour or two and then I’d feel more anxious. That happened for a month or two and then one day they said they didn’t want to give me any more and they just stopped. next weeks were HELLIH. Panic attacks where I was nearly fainting in public, being on my knees crying my eyes out, feeling like I was going to die, etc. All so bad that I ended up not leaving the house anymore. It was too scary. (It wasn’t until much later in life that I realized this was withdrawals—I was never told the medication was addictive. I just trusted this person.) made an appointment with my family doctor while at my wit’s end and told him about my panic attacks. ure enough, I’m sent off with an alprazolam script. The doctor just said “Take these, you’ll feel less anxious”. No warnings, no stipulations, just told me to take them. o I did. And I felt better. And that same doctor called in refills for me each month for maybe 6 months or more. Even increases the dose over the phone once or twice. Then one day, via his receptionist, I was told that they didn’t want to prescribe that medication to me anymore and to have a nice life, basically. Almost literally, actually.  spent the next years seeing various psychiatrists and therapists and ended up in and out of the ER and even the mental hospital a couple of times. I tried an absurd amount of psych meds. Over and over I’d take whatever they told me to. This and that RI until I finally could convince them, truthfully, that they weren’t helping me at all. Many times they made me feel worse. One even made me feel suicidal, a feeling I had never felt before. Finally they stopped pumping me full of antidepressants and just kept me on benzos. witched to diazepam though which was much better. always invariably got cut off very abruptly. And I’d feel like I was going to die and would have to see a new doctor. I’d spend years with that doctor and on the same dose and then bam, cut off.  since being on that medication I’ve had nothing but horrific experiences and a much, much worse quality of life. My anxiety is an entirely different beast. It went from manageable to worse than crippling. I can’t leave the house. I’ve developed dozens of phobias. I physically feel like death at all times. I even developed tics. Really bad ones. And whenever I ask about tapering off and quitting for good, doctors are only willing to do a fast 2-3 day taper because “that’s what’s safe”.

Anxiety,"It's been a while since I wrote about my problems on reddit but I feel like I need to put it out somewhere because I'm really hurting mentally. This post regards religion so I guess it's not for everyone or even might sound a bit crazy to some people but I just want to let it out. have struggled with anxiety basically my whole life, in the recent years it's been really bad, degrading my life quality very much.  I have taken many different antidepressant and medication but it has never really helped me that much. I have also been doing therapy and changed my therapist some time ago. My psychiatrists that I've been going to for a couple of years still struggled to put a final diagnosis on me because she wasn't exactly sure what is wrong.  Over 2 months ago I called an exorcist from my diocese. Being Polish and growing up in a catholic family I always had religion and God somewhere in the back of my head. I thought that maybe a help from a priest could do something? Maybe there's some evil force that won't leave me alone? I wanted to try everything I could if I ever wanted to end my life. In general I'd had a pretty good experience with faith and felt like sometimes praying somehow helped me. I called him and he asked me what's wrong etc. After some time he sent me an email with some questions like ""Have I ever done magic etc"".  (Of course, I have not) Couple weeks later I met with him and we talked about my problems and he said that in his view he didn't really find anything ""worrying"" from a ""religious"" point of view. I started praying with him repeating after him some prayers. I came back home. I wasn't thinking about this much after and actually kind of relieved that I could put my quiet suspicions about ""evil interference"" on my mental state completely aside.  over two months later so about a week ago I started feeling extreme anxiety, regret and guilt. I started to regret what I said. I started to regret saying that I wanna give my whole life to you know who. I wasn't ready for it. I started feeling a phobia fearing that it all could be used against me by the very same being I was praying to. I feel like I have said something I cannot undo. I wanted to help myself but I feel like I brought upon myself unbearable anxiety. I feel like it's piercing my chest and soul. I don't know what to do, I feel suicidal again. the feeling that most people don't need to ""declare"" such things like I did to be happy. Or maybe it wasn't a declaration but a prayer with a more serious feel to it and that's why I hurts me. And this time, I did it to myself. I feel like I let myself to be fooled by religious thinking. I rushed it too much. I should have thought about it more beforehand. I feel like I destroyed my whole life in a day and there's nothing I can do about it. I have a new phobia that won't leave me alone. I haven't really explicitly felt any bad effect of this on my life, frankly, I could argue that it even helped a bit but the anxiety and paranoia is worse than everything else.  I'm over-exaggerating everything or maybe it will be the final nail to the coffin of my mental state and life but I feel like it's the latter.I feel guilty and hopeless (anxiety and religion)",1635195764,3218,613

Anxiety,"Potential triggers ahead. I’ll mention specifically the things causing me anxiety.  had a baby at the end of July. We planned her and we’re excited for her. he’s my second daughter and after my first one I was okay. This second baby and the wave of hormones coupled with the pandemic have really set me off. My anxiety has never been so crippling.  don’t enjoy things anymore. I played with my first daughter. I constantly tried to teach her things and loved watching the next phase. With my second I have missed so many new things she does because I’m always in my phone researching. My husband will show me new things she began to do that I wouldn’t have noticed. Like when she found her toes. I’m super sad about it because I want to be there in the moment but I’m not. I’m in the future constantly researching. Trying to figure out if I made a mistake by bringing new life into this world.  spend hours reading and finding contradicting information about global warming, covid, religions, the economy, crime rates, whether schools are safe, etc. it’s exhausting. I don’t want to do it anymore but I keep finding myself back on Google. Looking at case numbers, trying to figure out if there’s a god or not, etc.  don’t want to do this anymore. I want to enjoy my life. I want to enjoy my babies. I want to focus on the now.  Please tell me the world is okay. The world is going to be okay and that my life will continue to be good.  am aware lack of sleep and hormones are contributing to the absolute worst my anxiety has ever been.

Anxiety,"Hi guys, this could be triggering, I'm not sure. Last night I was staying at a hotel. I was asleep and at around 1:30 am, the fire alarm went off. This was the loudest fire alarm I had ever encountered. As soon as the the first beep came from the alarm, I literally jumped out of my bed and screamed at the top of my lungs. My mom thought I was dying and I felt like I was having a heart attack.  was on the top floor and literally sprinted out of the building screaming at the top of my lungs. I was the first one out of the building and everyone else followed a couple minutes later. My mom thought that my reaction was abnormal, I think she is right. I have never encountered anything this scary, it felt like the world was ending.  had a similar experience once when my brother came home a day earlier than he was supposed to. I was home alone and no one told me he was sick and returning a day early. He rang the doorbell rapidly for like 20 minutes. My dogs were barking super loudly and my brother was banging on the door. I didn't know it was him; I thought there was a murder. I ran to the bathroom and started crying and decided to call the police. The police arrived and revealed that it was just my brother. not sure if these experiences were severe panic attacks or if there is something deeper below the surface.

Anxiety,"ome background: I’m a pretty good looking guy. It’s a fact I’ve always been pretty aware of given that I get hit on quite often. During my sophomore year of college, my girlfriend dumped me and left me for another guy. On top of that, I lost all my friends as we were in the same friend group. It absolutely devastated me and, after months of a very severe and deep depression, I ended up sleeping with someone I found rather unappealing. I was just so desperate to feel wanted at the time that I didn’t really care about who it was with. oon after this, I met a girl who seemed really nice. he let me hang with her friends and was nice to me and we soon began a relationship; however, her kindness was only surface level and she tortured me emotionally for around a year. he constantly slept with other guys, disrespected me, and manipulated me. It fucked up myself image even more than before. Towards the end of our partnership, I found myself sleeping with girls who I wasn’t interested in or attracted to because they initiated it and I just wanted to numb the pain I was feeling. I felt so gross about myself. For example, I went on a few dates with a really cute and nice girl during this all and I literally couldn’t even hold her hand; I felt that I was so gross and unworthy of her. After my relationship with my abuser, I willingly remained celibate for a few months…and then Covid hit. After a year long dry spell, I once again slept with someone I wasn’t attracted to at all just cause I was desperate and felt gross about it after. Thankfully, I got new friends around this time and saw my standards and self respect rise over time. I didn’t sleep with anyone I regretted for a long time. However, I recently moved to a new city and have entered a pretty real depression. During one of my first weeks here, I was hit on by an older lady who turned out to be rich and well connected. I didn’t really think about it too much, but one night when I was feeling particularly lonely, she hit me up and I went to her place. I initially didn’t plan on sleeping with her but changed my mind because I was attracted to her wealth. After it was done, I once again felt gross. Like I was an addict who relapsed. It’s been a few days now and I haven’t been able to shake that feeling of grossness. I just feel like I’ve devalued myself and my standards. I worry people are going to judge me for my past and that future partners won’t want me because of it. Do these feelings ever go away?I feel so gross about my sexual past",1635193214,2525,483

Anxiety,"I graduated over the summer from a top university. After graduation, I didn't have a job lined up, but was eventually hired for a job in my home state of NJ. I live right outside NYC, where most of my high school and college friends are, and thought that I'd soon move into the city since my job was going to be mostly remote. Unfortunately, my job was in east bumblefuck NJ and they had me coming in way more then I anticipated. The job just wasn't what I thought it would be so I quit after about a week and a half. Outside of work, I felt my social life was suffering too. My friends never seemed to want to do anything and since I didn't live in the city proper, it was hard for me to get to them when they wanted to hang. I couldn't really enjoy the excitement of the city given the fact I live in it. I was then hired at a super cool job in Miami and decided to say fuck it and move out here not knowing anyone. At first it was fine, but as time as gone on, it's felt like Miami isn't for me. The culture and the people just aren't what I like/fit in with. It's a very vain town and I hate to sound elitist, but there are a lot of dumb people. The city just isn't my speed and I've entered a deep depression recently. When I was back home, I was like a firecracker. I was doing a million things a minute and felt so motivated to get things done. Now I barely leave bed. I do really like my job down here, especially cause it's mostly remote, but fuck I don't know what to do. I plan on going home for a few weeks, but my mom keeps reminding me that I'm going to have to go back to Miami sooner rather than later. I feel like she doesn't see me drowning here or see that I'm unhappy. I was so desperate to be someone different and special that I didn't think things through. I'm going to speak from the heart here and say that I miss the culture and liveliness of NYC. I miss my friends and the limitless possibilities of the City. A part of me feels like I haven't given Miami a fair chance and the feelings I feel will follow me wherever I move; however, everyone I've spoken to in Miami from the Northeast has expressed what I have. I was making so much progress with my mental health and now it's gone. Not to get too personal, but I used to very much have low self-esteem and often found myself waking up in beds I would have preferred not to wake up in. After lots of self work, I had finally started to improve and have value for myself, but once again slept with someone I didn't really want to out of a place of loneliness. leeping with this woman has made me sick to my core and spiraled my depression even more. I literally almost vomited the next morning I was so upset with myself. I don't know what to do and I feel like I'm trapped here. To top it all off, I make like 40k a year which is a fucking joke salary for Miami. I've been staying with relatives, but I literally do not know how I'll be able to live on my own with a paycheck like mine. I want to move back home, but I do really like my job and think it's very easy.

Anxiety,"Long post ahead, and should probably have a trigger warning. only just found this sub. I've never told anyone the details of my anxiety before, even my Dr only knows the bare minimum. I need to get it out. o here goes. terrified that I'm going to die. My anxiety is mainly health based. Headache? It's a brain tumor, or could be a blood clot. Cut on my finger? It's going to go septic. Cough? Lung cancer. Covid has caused me sheer terror. Every single night, something is keeping me awake. At the moment, it's my swollen toe. o, obviously, I now must have diabetes, and will have to have my foot amputated. not all health related, though. I can't look up at the sky on a clear night, because I'm convinced I'm going to see a comet hurtling towards the Earth. I'm terrified of Tsunamis. I live by the sea, but it's the south coast of the UK, so I should be quite safe. Doesn't stop me worrying though. that all barely scratches the surface. The funniest thing, though? I work in health care, front line staff. I have worked in a general hospital, I used to work in a hospice. I now work in mental health, on an inpatient unit. Honestly, you couldn't make this up. Oh, and I have epilepsy. Which not only adds to the fear, but it also means that I'm very limited on what anxiety medication I can take. I've tried all the ones that I'm able to take (don't ask me what, though, I can't remember. A lovely side effect of my epilepsy is a terrible memory). None of them worked. I'm now waiting for a prescription for a beta blocker, but even the thought of taking it is causing me anxiety. It's like some cruel joke. have tried talking to my O about it, but it's really hard. He knows I have anxiety, but he doesn't know how bad it is. And the word ""anxiety"" is used a lot these days. If I mention I have it to anyone, people just kind of roll their eyes. It's so bad that I often just sit and stare and worry. And sometimes cry. I'm always focused on something. It really is having a huge impact on my life, and it's getting worse. I can't set foot in a lift anymore. I can't take my kids on to the pier, because I'm so sure they will fall off (I worry a lot about them, too). We're meant to be taking the kids abroad for the first time next year, but the thought of getting on a plane makes me feel physically sick. Then of course I have bad social anxiety, but at the moment the health stuff is so much worse, so at least it's not that bad, I suppose. don't know what I hope to get out of this post.

Anxiety,"As a gay man (31M), whenever I’m in predominantly straight male spaces, I always get anxious to the point where I have this tight feeling in my chest, and my armpits start sweating. I think it’s because in comparison to most straight men, I always felt like I wasn’t as masculine as they are, and was never really into stereotypically masculine things like sports for example. I always feel pressured to be more masculine than I normally am out of fear that they’re gonna clock me. Are there any other gay men who feel the same way?Are there any gay men who get anxious when they’re around straight men?",1635186751,603,109
Anxiety,"o I have really bad anxiety, diagnosed with General anxiety disorder and meds really don’t help. The longest I’ve kept a job is 2 years. I’ve had over 20 jobs within the past 4 years because I just panic once I have to start so I quit and start, quit and start. Basically after I’m done with training and have to actually perform the job, I just get overwhelmed, feel like there’s too much pressure or that I’m being micro managed, I’ll call out and then I panic from calling out thinking I’m a bad employee so I must quit and just start over so it just cycles. ometimes I’ll just pace back and forth in the morning and just won’t go in because I’m thinking of what’s going to go wrong at work.  trigger is customer service jobs, absolutely hate working in the open or call centers, I hate answering phones or people staring at me if I’m taking too long then I feel like they’re becoming upset at me so sometimes I’ll go in the bathroom and have a meltdown.  fast forward to now, I’m completely broke and been unemployed for months and unemployment ended and I finally got a job offer.   It’s the most money I’ve been offered, $21 an hour but it’s at a bank, and that’s triggering as heck, I’m already having anxiety, but I couldn’t afford to not say yes. I just hate myself.

All because I’ll fall into some long bout of days/weeks or a lifetime of intense sleeplessness.   years ago I had a nervous breakdown and couldn’t sleep for a long time and it was horrifying.

Anxiety,"Long story short, I was sick and thought it was something else, spent a week in and out of doctors just to be told I’m fine, and just recently got blood work done to rule everything out. Results came in and were nearly perfect, with a few things that weren’t normal but were fine, mainly because of diet. Doctor never said it directly, but I assumed he was ready to talk about anxiety, as it was one of the things he brought up while talking about what could be going on. During my follow up for the blood work all he did was prescribe me 3mg melatonin and sent me on my way. Just about an hour ago my mom told me my follow up was on Friday, and I thought nothing much of it… until just now.Ive been going out way more lately (mainly walking, but I try running as much as I physically can) so I’ve been super sore, today being the day I decide to take a break because I’m physically hurting from it. Being uncomfortable has kind of kept me on edge, and my anxiety is sparking up again. I thought about bringing it up, but ive never talked face to face with someone about mental health since I was a kid, and that was only because I was forced into therapy. Didn’t last long. I don’t feel it now, but I’m sure I’m gonna be terrified to go when the time comes. I don’t know what to do and I fear talking to him, especially in front of my mom.

Anxiety,"Yesterday, dogs came near me (I guess they found me too interesting) and started playing/wrestling near me. I had to move slowly to escape them. I didn't get bitten or scratched BUT when I came home, I saw a droplet on my glasses' outer part. I took a shower and I was curious about how the droplet behaves. Then, while I was washing my glasses, water may have ran over an unknown wound and transmit the rabies virus because water may have went with the saliva. I'm considering dog saliva because I have encountered dogs but I also highly doubt a dog can spit that high, on to my glasses. (I was wearing them) The weather was also cold but it wasn't raining. It wa a teeny, tiny droplet, less than a mm in diameter that didn't dry for at least 20 minutes and the heater was on in the car. Maybe something else can accumulate? were: Came close to me but didn't bite or scratch, playing/wrestling without howling, was able to escape by moving slowly.

I've just finished a pretty big disagreement with my partner over this and currently just wondering the streets trying to make sense of what's wrong with me. both professional wrestlers, I used to be pretty good, I'd show up to training 5 nights a week, I'd work shows all over the country, I was confident and happy. I have no idea when or this started but about 3 years ago these anxious feelings set in when ever I'd have training and for a while I'd push through them until I couldn't any more, I started going less until eventually I just stopped showing up completely and then lockdown hit so there was no training anyway this time I sought counselling, saw 3 different counsellors but none of them could get to the root of the issue, none of it helped I finished 3 different courses of counselling feeling no better. training starts coming back and I decide that I'll just fake it and hope the anxiety goes away, which was fine until it was time to leave home and head over to the school, I had a full blown panic attack. My girlfriend who is quite obviously sick of all this because she has had to put up with it for 3 years snapped and said I've pretty much set the mood for tonight and tomorrow night (supposed to be training tomorrow as well) and maybe I should just quit and I agreed with her, maybe I should. don't think I'll ever recover from this, I'll never be the old me again, I've poured so much into my wrestling and I'm just shell of myself now. I can't even watch wrestling now without getting that horrible knot in my stomach, I just avoid it at all costs. genuinely don't know what to do anymore, I feel an equal part of shame and just weak and it hurts that I'm letting my girlfriend down as wellMy anxiety over training has transitioned into a full blown phobia",1635184016,1821,343
Anxiety,"For months, I have struggled with the idea of getting the covid-19 vaccine. I hate the idea of the mandates and being restricted from doing things by not being vaccinated.

While I wish I felt my relief by doing so, I am just now anxious and dreading the second dose which I am due for tomorrow night. I am to the point that I am considering not even going to my appointment. Has anyone else experiences fear/anxiety over the vaccine? if so, how did you overcome it.

Anxiety,"I'm not old but I fear old age. You see, I am very anxious and one way I sometimes try to calm myself (doesn't always work) is to tell myself that the likelihood of what I fear is fairly low. I do this after I Google the illness and finding it's common in people who are 60 or older, for instance. Unfortunately, that seems to be the majority of diseases. While there are some that are common in childhood, the majority of painful or deadly diseases occur as we get older.  terrifies me. Eventually will come a day that you think you could have a disease and there is a good chance that you will have it...or another...or another.  Think of it as monsters creeping, getting closer and closer. There won't be one, there will be dozens, hundreds, thousands. All kinds of diseases and disabilities. And you will be weaker to fight them off. I think there was this doctor on a TV show talking about how even a bad cold could kill you when you get older.  feel a deep sense of powerlessness when I think about things. I don't understand how older people who are anxious deal with this. Is there a sense of resignation? Do they actually try do unhealthy things (e.g., smoke a lot) to speed up the whole process and die already? Because I have taken anti-anxiety medications and they do not eliminate anxiety (even when they do work). In fact, older people can't take many anxiety medications because of drug interactions, being on so many meds already. I'm just feeling overwhelmed.Do you fear old age and increased vulnerability to more and more diseases?",1635182925,1550,279

I seldom hear it spoken about but it is that my back muscles (and only the spine) will keep twitching and cause my stomach muscles to contract involuntarily as well. It makes for extreme discomfort no matter if I am laying down or standing or eating, etc. This also pairs with stomach issues on a near daily basis that I have not yet had diagnosed as IB, but I strongly believe I do as there is also family history of it. My arms and legs will twitch occasionally but the back twitching always throws me off because it can be physically debilitating.

Anxiety,"Around next month or in December I have to see the Doctor's office. Everyday I think about it, and I just imagine scenarios where I'm there and might have a panic attack. Are there methods to overcome this feeling. Before the pandemic I had the worst panic attack in my life where I pretty much almost passed out at Costco, that pretty much made me stay home. I tried to go out but was only successful once. It's been 2 years and almost no progress, I do feel less anxious now and almost never get anxiety attacks or if I do get them they don't even last a minute. I still don't feel confident just to see a doctor for 20 min, just keep imagining scenarios so I can get over it, it just feels hopeless now I want to be able to go outside and be happy again.Overcoming agoraphobia",1635173093,779,150

Anxiety,"I have had anxiety all my life since around 11 years old. I’ve not coped the best. I drank from 26 most days until lately and really have cut back massively. I go to the gym every day and take NAC which they say helps with intrusive thoughts. I have also quit caffeine, sugar and smoking in the last few months due to a bad break up and not wanting to trigger more anxiety. The trouble is I have constant music playing in my head. Like TikTok songs over and over every five seconds. Then I have dreams I remember pop up. Then I have things I’ve said or done in the past haunt me and make me feel terrible like people really disliking me. Then I have thoughts of the future and loosing loved ones and ending up alone and a failure with no job in my head. I just can’t function anymore. Is this anxiety or something more ? I have read i could possibly have adhd. I took sertraline three years ago and it made my mind quieter but it made me extremely impulsive and wreck less and I don’t think that worked for me.

Anxiety,"Hi all!  have anxiety accompanied by panic disorder. This first photo was during the mental breakdown that ended with hospitalization. The second photo is me in the same spot, happier, healthier, receiving treatment, and coming to terms with my new diagnosis.  story: I’ve always had bad anxiety, but I never had a panic attack before. 2019 was an extremely stressful year for me. We were getting married, attending 10 other weddings, my job was destroying me, and my husbands job was destroying him. We were both spread so thin and didn’t realize how close to snapping we were. Well one Friday I had an awful day at work and decided to smoke dabs - not something I do. Well it sent me into what I now know as a panic spiral. The whole night I was trying to stay calm and fighting the panic. This photo was taken on aturday. I went to brunch for my friends birthday, and I couldn’t keep my anxiety under control. I stepped outside and found an alcove where no one could see me, and I cried. And cried. Luckily my best friend (pictured) sat with me until my partner came to pick me up. 6 days later I was admitted to McLean for treatment of panic disorder and anxiety. 1 year later, I came back to that same restaurant as a new person. I still struggle with panic disorder and fear and anxiety, but I have a handle on it. I am educated, receiving treatment, on medication, and I’ve learned so so many tools and skills to help me cope.

Convinced we're dealing with some serious shit.  I go to the doctor. ""It's nothing."" anxiety is not convinced. In order to get me to calm the fuck down, my doctor agrees to let me get an MRI. o I go to get an MRI.  news: That issue is nothing.Bad news: That MRI found something, and I've had to get an ultrasound and am sitting in a hospital waiting room waiting to get a biopsy and *somehow* holding off the world's biggest panic attack. Maybe I don't want a bunch of nurses running in here to sedate me.  doctor thinks this is *probably* nothing and the biopsy is to rule it out, but I'm still an anxious mess.

Anxiety,"Last week, I had one of the most intense panic attacks I’ve dealt with since I first started dealing with them. It was caused by a bad head rush that led me to think that I was going to faint and I started freaking out, and I had to convince myself to go to urgent care. Of course they said it was just a panic attack and I finally bit the bullet and decided to get prescribed prozac. When I went to pick up the prescription, the lady was listing out the side effects and when she said that anxiety/depression will likely be worse for the first couple months of use, I just started crying.

Anxiety,"My anxiety isn't terrible since I've been medicating for it, which I'm incredibly grateful for. However, one thing that it really makes hard is trying to communicate with people, especially new people. Talking in person to someone is scary because I feel like I don't have time to think through everything I want to say as much as I want to, because there will be an awkward pause, or the subject will shift, and my thought will become irrelevant. Calling someone on the phone is essentially the same problem but amplified because I can't see the person's face, leading to difficulty knowing what they're feeling and more anxiety about the conversation being tiring or uninteresting to them. Texting is difficult because, even if I do have time to think what I'm going to say through, I worry about taking too long to say something or respond, for fear of seeming rude or insensitive. I just want to talk to people and interact with them, since I haven't for so long, but I always feel like I'm frustrating them or letting them down or something, even though logically I know I'm probably not. It's that uncertainty that's so frustrating and annoying.

Anxiety,"Not quite sure how to explain this but I know part of doing CBT to help with anxiety is to challenge your unrealistic negative thoughts by doing the thing you're anxious about and confirming that the negative thought doesn't happen. But how am I supposed to cope when the negative thing DOE happen? This seems to be a regular occurrence for me. Maybe I just have really bad luck. I rarely leave the house on my own and, whenever I do try to, something I'm fearing always seems to happen and that makes me doubly anxious about trying to do it the next time. Normally ends up in me just avoiding the task forever because each time this happens it reinforces my panic.As a couple of examples (my anxiety is specifically social based):- I hate drawing attention to myself from strangers. Fear = being negatively noticed by strangers. When I tried to walk alone to my doctors once I had an absolute nut job follow me almost immediately, all the way to the surgery. Yelling crazy stuff about what I was wearing and my hair colour or just anything they could grasp on I guess. I was mortified.- I don't like navigating unfamiliar road layouts. Fear = people will notice me acting strangely. o today I go to walk to a post box and ofc there are huge roadworks going on with multiple parts of the pavement closed and confusing signs. I don't know what I'm doing and end up walking in front of a car which beeps at me. these situations (and multiple others) leave me basically useless for at least the rest of the day. I cry and am really mad at myself for being so broken and not able to cope. It reinforces my fears that going outside is a bad thing. to the point now where even if I try to go out and accidentally forget something so have to walk back and get it, I take that as a bad omen that something awful is going to happen and I'll just come home and not go to the thing. Do I just have the worst luck?? I don't know how to cope when things go wrong. orry for rambling.Accidentally Reinforcing My Fears?",1635159826,2003,377

Anxiety,"Trigger warning: very heavy vent, hopelessness, suicidal thoughts  diagnosed with GAD for 2, about to be 3, years and just recently got diagnosed with depression two weeks ago. Took long enough. When my anxiety gets really bad, I get really suicidal. I already have daily suicidal thoughts because of my depression which is really bad as it is, but it heightens it so, so so much. Now this is going to be a vent; I apologize if it’s all over the place... both is a personal hell for me. I can’t compare the two on which one is worse because they overlap so much with one another for me. Whoever said anxiety + depression are best friends was most certainly correct. Why did I have to have either? I don’t know who I am without them, who I’d be, how I’d feel, so even though I hate having them with all my heart, It’s scary to think about ever getting better. I don’t want to. But I can’t help but think, why me? I’m fourteen. I never guessed that high school would be great like everyone makes it out to be, and I was 1000% right. But so many people seem to be having the time of their life. And then there’s me. A fucking miserable creature just trying to keep themselves alive everyday ! going to have two big anxiety triggers this week; possibly getting called on to present my project and may have to do a 60 second speech. o firstly, I get to freak out days before about both of those things and then further spiral down into a depressive episode that I was already slipping into. No matter how much I prepare, it doesn’t make it go away.  just finished our last project a few weeks ago, that was required for us to present, and each day we had that class (Monday’s and Tuesday’s; Friday’s we didn’t present though), our teacher would spin a wheel three times to see which three students would present each day. It was hell for me, I was absolutely terrified each time, hoping I wouldn’t get called on. Rehearsing over and over again, just in case, but still being just as terrified. I ended up not getting called on, and on the last day we had to present and she asked the following students if there was anyone else who had to present, I didn’t go. And that makes me upset. I was as prepared as I could’ve been, I rehearsed days ahead, yet I panicked per usual last minute and didn’t go. o I lost my 20 presentation points for not going and got an 80/100 on my presentation for that. If I was able to go, I could’ve gotten a full score.  anxiety doesn’t revolve just around school, it revolves around almost every aspect in my life (hence the name...*generalized* anxiety...), but school is definitely a big trigger, especially presentations. They’ve caused me anxiety attacks all the way back in elementary, and I’m a freshman in highschool now. I’ve lost hope long ago for myself. Everyone always says that the more you get up there, the less nerve wracking it’ll be to present, and that it prepares you for the “real world”. Nobody gets it, do they? That it’s not just being a little nervous? It makes me feel so hopeless hearing that because if I can’t even do normal day to day activities that people wouldn’t consider bad or present without severe anxiety attacks, it just confirms in my head that I’m not gonna make it. I’m barely holding on by a thread as it is and having to deal with all this and a brain that hates itself makes everything so, so so hard.  just so tired. I’m not living past 18 anyway most likely, but for now, I’m just so stuck. I don’t want to talk to anybody about this because I don’t want to burden anyone with my mental health, and I’m almost not trying to get sent to a mental hospital. Therapy has never helped me, and I’ve never found any techniques that have even been remotely helpful for me. And I’m really tired of hearing about breathing techniques. But I’m also tired of this life, living always on edge, hating myself and everything I do, caring too much about everything or not caring at all, feeling numb, wanting to die, it goes on. Im just really struggling:(I’ve been struggling with this for so long.having an anxiety disorder is ruining me (very heavy vent, TW lots of suicidal thoughts)",1635156671,4144,765
Anxiety,"When i try sleep i feel like it’s my eyes but prob more my eye lids flickering, when i open my eyes it stops. I am guessing that’s my stress and anxiety or being fatigued.

Anxiety,"I had a very very big panic attack after breaking up with my long time girlfriend. After that happened, It  caused PTD about my health anxiety thoughts of this nose disease I’ve been scared of getting for the past two years. Each time I’ve had health anxiety about this topic the anxiety would last a month or so and my nose would feel weird and it felt like I’d get weird symptoms and I couldn’t stop focusing on it. It would be debilitating.

Anxiety,"I don't really know where to start with this so I guess I'll just jump right in. My city came out of lockdown a couple months ago -- that lockdown was probably six to eight weeks, I can't quite recall. I work in the digital space so I'm set up to work from home. I hate working from home with a vengeance. I prefer having my work and my home life completely separate, but I get that we're living in complicated times. I adapted to deal with working from home but through some twist of bureaucratic B, I wound up having zero work to do during lockdown. o I was in this bizarre situation where I was still expected to show that I had worked for eight hours a day, but with no actual work to do. o that was eight hours of sitting in front of a computer vegging out with a helluva lot of doom scrolling or reading on Kindle. admit I didn't do much to practice self-care and I didn't do much to alter my routine so my current situation is on me. I've also since found out I'm pregnant so I'm told that could be contributing to mood. It's now been a month or two since my city came out of lockdown and I've been able to go back to the office, but now when I'm home, I get this stressed, trapped feeling that I don't know how to deal with. I'm not comfortable at home, and I now can't seem to enjoy hobbies that I used to love (i.e. I used to love reading, but I haven't been able to pick up a book in months without having a major panic attack). I really don't know how to explain how I'm feeling. I just know I feel stir crazy, weekends are no longer relaxing to me -- in fact I dread them because I don't know what to do with myself. I'm also more prone to panic attacks in the evening at the thought of being at home. also feel really guilty for feeling so stressed out and wound up and unable to cope because I know there are people out there who have it way worse than me, and who have been in lockdown longer, and who have lost their employment. o in the grand scheme of things, this is nothing and I should thank my lucky stars. anyone have any advice for how I can get back to enjoying the things I used to enjoy before lockdown? I just want to feel like me again. Haven't been myself since the last lockdown in my area.

My head hurt and I was slightly dry heaving. The nausea stayed around 4-5 hours. I tried using an ice pack, distracting myself with YouTube, breathing, especially so I could fall asleep because I had plans later on the day, but none worked. It wasn’t until we got back together that my nausea completely disappeared. I just wanna know any advice in case it happens again because it was genuinely a horrible feeling and I’ve never had nausea induced anxiety before- I’ve only had anxiety attacks or smaller forms of anxiety but usually it would go away within a couple minutes-hour or so but this was even worse because it stayed and wouldn’t go away.Advice/Coping with anxiety nausea",1635153602,895,162

Anxiety,"I participated in an online event held within my community. They were holding a prize draw at the end of the event and everyone who attended the event has a chance to win. Basically, the event is a virtual exhibition held using Gather.town. Anyone who logged in and took a tour around the virtual exhibition will be eligible for an entry to the prize. People are allowed to log in and log out but they need to attend the closing event if they want to hear the prize draw announcement. was stupid of me to think that the prize draw would not require participants to attend the announcement event. I thought they were going to just post the winner and that's it. Turns out, my entry is selected to win the main prize, a Nintendo witch. My friends panicked and called me over the phone, but it was too late, they held a countdown and I failed to show up inside the Gather.town on time so they picked another winner. My friends are not to blame because they themselves didn't expect anyone to win so they just leisurely watched the announcement event and it was particularly my fault for not attending the announcement event anyway (and it is not my friend's obligation to remind me to attend the announcement event). last few days, I have constantly been punishing myself for it. The feling of losing on an opportunity hurts so bad. If I got into some bad luck, I could just shrug it off and said ""well damn, what a bad day it is"". However, the fact that it should be a lucky day turned into an unlucky day feels like salt being rubbed upon an open wound. ometimes, I could get calm and forget all about it, but when my mood was bad (such as at work), the feeling started to pull me back inside the abyss. inside, I knew that I can't change the past. I know that it is only a witch, I also have never planned to get one before and if I indeed get one I would probably just sell it off. I also tried to calm myself by assuring myself that my net gain is actually +0 (nothing changes at all  with my life), it is not like I lost money or something. Furthermore, I know very well that what I am facing right now is nothing compared to the pain that other people in this sub has ever felt. I know very well this is a very unimportant, first world issue that some people would easily shrug off. Even thought I know all this, the feeling still keeps haunting me and I just can't get it off my mind. I wished there is an antidote thay could make me forget that I missed such an opportunity.  feeling is also exacerbated even more everytime I think ""Why does this kind of unimportant issue bothers you a lot?"". I punish myself even more for being weak to such an unimportant issue.

Anxiety,"Hi all, For a bit of context, I will be going into year 12 (final year of high school in Australia) next year. I have recently been dealing with anxiety and have been prescribed medication so I guess it has been a rough couple of years with multiple lockdowns in my city as well. Essentially, I don’t really like my school. I moved to the school a year ago (just before covid hit) and despite the fact that I’ve made myself some friends, I’ve also made myself an enemy (it’s a long story, but it was my fault and I have apologised multiple times). I don’t really mind not being friends with this girl but what is troubling me is the fact that next year will be extremely busy and our whole year level will be together constantly, and I guess what I’m wondering is if I could be better off somewhere else. This being said, my grades have seen an incredible improvement at this school and I know it’s the environment that will help me achieve good grades. Maybe I should just hang on for one more year? It could also be the spike in anxiety that I’ve experienced today causing such feelings. All comments are greatly appreciated :)I don’t really like my school and my final year is coming up.

I know this sounds outrageous, but at this point I can't even live a productive life. I fall asleep at 7:30 am and wake up at 5pm and this habits wastes my day.

Anxiety,"Hello everyone, I am 30 year old male and my life past 5 last months feels its is completely ruined.   I have been experiencing extreme panic attacks and nonstop anxiety ever since I have taken a vaccine, I won't mention which but im sure you'll guess it right.  I remember waking up during the night approximated 2 days after taking a shot during the night and I had one of the most intense panic attack. Prior to this I have never experienced high anxiety nor panic attacks. It started as if someone was squeezing my neck yet it felt like a tingly feeling, and about 20 sec later my heart started to race so fast and I didn't know what was going on I experience heart palpitations and arrhythmia. trangely these panic attacks lasted only 2 weeks and went away although I still do experience them occasionally but I have learned to accept them so I no longer experience them.  Right now I experience extreme anxiety ever since I wake up in the morning. This typically last ever since I wake up and gets better towards the evening around 7pm I feel less stressed. My neck muscles are very tight despite that I stretch them daily. ometimes my left leg muscle is pulling, im not sure if its because of some muscle tension and nerve being stuck or what it could be, ome days its there and others its not. I dont feel dizzy that much  when I sit or lay but when I move, like walk I feel like I cannot keep my balance at all and I feel foggy. I think this has something to do with muscle tension. My genitals are squeezing with a tingly sensation  about every 15 seconds as if im in some sort of fear, but im not. ometimes I dont even feel anxious and yet have these symptoms. ometimes I get this feeling that my head has some pressure but no headache. Occasionally I get a feeling of a tight chest as of someone is sitting on my ribs. seems my anxiety is getting worse when im alone but better when im around people, or in the office, although some days can also be straight agonising. I have weird depression waves that last about 2 hours and go by their own and im not sure what am I supposed to do.  Im already taking all the necessary vitamins, I eat healthy but im not as active due to the tendon pain that had developed on my left foot about a month ago. I try to do yoga, meditation and some HIIT exercises at home which seem to help slightly for couple of hours.   dont have any fears or phobias, im just extremely tired of this all mentally and this has been very agonising for me.   I did all the blood tests, visited neurologists, did scans, everything came out ok with an exception that I have a slight scoliosis due to too much sitting because its a office job. I refuse to take any anxiety meds and I have visited therapist couple of times which did help slightly. Other techniques im reading to just accept the anxiety and let it be, but yet it bothers me so much I cannot function properly.

I keep seeing more posts on tiktok about pregnancy and stuff and it’s freaking me out because it feels like everything in the world is trying to tell me she’s pregnant. The worst are the videos that are like “HE HAD NO IDEA HE WA PREGNANT UNTIL 30 MINUTE BEFORE HE GAVE BIRTH.” That freaks me out because while I keep trying to tell myself things like she’s had her period but this girl didn’t, the test didn’t have a line or maybe it was just really faint, blah blah blah. We wore protection. There was no leak. I have no reason to think she is other than my anxiety getting the best of me. I just feel like I’m insane. I want to talk to someone but who do I tell this to. They’ll think I’m crazy. he didn’t seem to have any symptoms the two months leading up to our breakup. he had her period. I made her take a pregnancy test. Another thing is that when I overthink things I also imagine things as if they were real.

Anxiety,"I am a long-time sufferer of anxiety disorders and depression (since childhood, around twenty years). I am 27/F, autistic with ADHD. I must say before the rest of the post that I am not looking for a diagnosis, nor am I looking for medical advice. I am looking for opinions from others that have experienced panic/anxiety attacks. few months ago, I experienced a terrifying myriad of symptoms over the course of two hours due to mixing Cymbalta and Buspirone. I was lying in bed, and I felt a lump move from my heel up to my abdomen and into my chest. I became very lightheaded - completely weightless - I couldn't feel my insides or anything, all I could feel was cold spots, and I was terrified that I was having a pulmonary embolism or a stroke. My heart was beating so fast, and I thought I was dying. I did not suffer any lasting effects - I was fine once I had some water, toast, and was distracted by a friend and fell asleep. been off Cymbalta and Buspirone for three months, and last night I began experiencing this again. I was lying in bed, half asleep, listening to music, when I felt a bump (like someone hitting my bed) inside my head. I began having cold spots and started shaking, and I began to feel lightheaded. I sat up, rubbed my head, got up to stretch, and went to get water and half a peanut butter sandwich, and I recovered quickly. I avoided experiencing the same traumatizing episode I had a few months ago. have a lot of anxiety normally, and I am insecure at night/insecure about sleep (but I have 3+ night lights to feel more secure), but I thought I felt okay. I was not scared, nervous, or any other negative emotion prior to this episode, and I was unable to identify triggers.  this sound like a panic/anxiety attack? I know that anxiety affects everyone differently. I'm seeing my therapist in three days, but I feel silly... I can't tell if it's my mental health or physical health, and I'm nervous/insecure about telling her about it. Thank you for reading &amp; for your time.

Anxiety,"TW/ parental death/ health issuesthis is very strange and i need to talk it out but it’s currently 2AM so typing will have to do. My mom went to the hospital today for chest pain- she had a bunch of tests done and seems to just be a false alarm. I wasn’t really that worried throughout the day and spent the evening watching tv with her. Until tonight. My mom snores like crazy and so to be nice to my dad she decided to sleep in the guest room downstairs. My room is upstairs and she swore she was fine but the idea of her not being within earshot of someone else made me really nervous. I decided to sleep on the couch. Although I haven’t been able to sleep a wink. At first it was just ‘oh i’m sleeping on the couch instead of my bed and I had caffeine a bit too late in the day’ which turned into ‘i’m really worried about my mom’ which has now turned into ‘i know that my mom is going to die tonight.’ In my messed up brain it all adds up. I just came home from college for fall break, my sister just got internet after camping this weekend and was able to call this evening. My brother called and so did my grandparents (my moms parents). My dad, mom and I had a good evening. I for some reason have convinced myself that my mom is going to die tonight. I have writte n a script in my head of what I am going to tell 911 when I inevitably have to make the call. I even went upstairs to get my CPR mask from my first aid kit. I have lost it. I know this is so unreasonable but I can’t stop it.

Anxiety,"  cant tell if im just being a bitch or if I truly shouldnt be working at my new job.  reference, im 25/m, with a lot of unchecked mental issues: adhd, social  anxiety, depression, possibly autism/aspergers. I've never seen a  counselor about any of this shit and have been holding so much in  basically all my life. (going to see a psychiatrist this week)  got a new job that deals with customer service, something im really not  good at or comfortable with. I have this problem of hyping things up  and not properly managing expectations, so naturally I hype this job up  to shit because its has a nice office, young company with rly nice  employees. But since day one i have been on the brink of panic attacks  at the idea of having to talk and deal with customers over the phone and  in person. Its gotten better over the past couple weeks but its still  something i think about all the time.  heres my problem, I have lost all self confidence and cant make a  decision to save my life. Right now, I dont know if I should just quit  and look for something thats a bit more mellow to allow me to address my  problems and mental state, OR if I am just being overdramatic and  should just 'tough it out'.  dont know if I have what it takes to do this job that stresses me out  \*and\* deal with my mental issues right now. I want to do graphic design  because that seems like something more my speed, but I dont trust myself  to quit and be able to motivate myself to learn everything I need to  get a job doing it. Because in 2019 I quit my other job, doing a similar  warranty job, because dealing doing customer service was something i  hated (and ofc I completely forgot why I quit that last job when  accepting this new one) And the following 18 months I did quite  literally nothing. Just a year and a half completely gone from my life,  wasted. If anything I've learned from those 18 months is how bad things  can get so at least I have that I suppose.  I dont really trust myself to quit right now because i feel like Id  just fall back into that rut. But I feel like in this moment in my life,  dealing with all these unchecked mental issues, It would be really nice  to have the time to address these issues directly, as well as learn  graphic design to hopefully kickstart that.  what do you guys think, am I just being a bitch or should I quit to  properly address these problems?

Anxiety,"Um. Hi. I typically find myself avoiding most communities like this (and most communities in general) just because I find it hard to justify to myself that maybe it *is* helpful to reach out. Whether it be just to talk in an open space to *feel* like someone is listening or to genuinely talk with someone. It's hard to make it make sense in my mind that it's not near as much of a bother to anyone else as it is to myself. Lol. But here I am.  I had a lot happen in my life that made my anxiety reach a sort of spike. I left home on extremely bad circumstances and floated between two places to stay for a combined month before flying off to Alaska to visit my then-boyfriend (now-husband).  safe to say that every time I thought about having to travel back ""home,"" it would throw me into a panic. I remember so many times during the days leading up to my planned departure just saying to my husband, ""I'm not leaving. I don't wanna go back and there's nothing you can do to make me!"" And when he would adamantly refuse because it was ""safer"" back home, it would just throw me into this episode. I was being such a toddler, but I truly did hate the idea of returning somewhere that didn't really have anything waiting for me. And it would make me shell up so hard. Because before I came to Alaska, I was hardly taking care of myself and there was nothing keeping me from overthinking.  when it came down to it, I didn't leave. I stayed. I stayed fully believing that it was going to cause everyone to abandon me because of my stupidly impulsive decision, but it felt better to me than taking 5 painstaking flights back to a place that made me feel as though there wasn't a single reason for me to be there.  my husband wasn't mad. uprisingly enough. He wasn't mad at me. Just worried about where I was going to stay. Because we were dead broke, lol. For all the overthinking I do, the last thing I even thought about was finances. And he's in the military, so, at the time, he was staying in the barracks, which are off limits to have people stay overnight at. But he spent every bit of his time off (and his paychecks) staying with me and floating around to every hotel we could find.  he had two very awesome friends who lived our chaos with us every step of the way. Offering advice, driving us everywhere, taking turns ""babysitting"" me when he had to work. It was quite honestly the most imperfect, perfect outcome that could have taken place because I was too scared to go home. We did a lot in a very short time and for the first time in a while, that stupid heaviness went away for the most part. I didn't feel like someone was squeezing my heart and lungs like a stressball all the time anymore.  things were finally happening again. I wasn't home alone stuck with my thoughts. I wasn't working a job that left me sitting with nothing but my own horrible brain to keep me occupied. I wasn't spending my time planning a future around a shitty school that didn't even offer the subject I was interested in. I didn't have no one anymore. And, I had my husband around again. Time was moving.  one of the things that added to the ""we have to keep moving"" aspect of our time together, was that they were all about to disappear for 2 months for a patrol. And while that wasn't the reason my husband and I got married, it did mean we had a deadline. I mean, nearly two weeks before they all left, my husband and I were still staying in a mini camper that we had rented from the base. And before he left, we needed to make sure we had somewhere for me to stay more permanently while he was away. Cue wedding bells.  had been talking about marriage since he got his first phone call during boot camp. We got engaged a week into my visit to him. And we stupidly thought we had to have my birth certificate, which got lost in the mail a week before we had to be married. Luckily, we didn't need it. Unluckily, that meant we had accidentally *nearly* run out of time. We got married 3 days before he had to leave. And got our house 2 days before. It was the definition of a speedrun, but beautiful nonetheless.  if you're reading this, I bet you're like, ""Well, cool story, but this has hardly anything to do with anxiety."" Which, yeah, valid. But I like to provide backstory. The anxiety part really comes in after all of it. Because, like I said, I was with the person I love most in this world and time didn't feel stopped anymore because I was doing things! I didn't have time to focus on my anxiety and paranoia. But, when my husband and the only two friends I had made all left 2 days after we finally got settled, anxiety came crashing back into the picture.  while it's already hard to deal with your literally brandnew husband disappearing for 2 months with minimal contact, it's quite a bit harder when you realize you're left without anything to actually do. Zero resources. Zero friends. No car. No job. Nothing. Just a big house and a long wait till anything really *can* happen again.  took approximately a day and a half before my stupid brain got started again on trying to convince me that everything that had just happened was doomed to fail and that I was worthless. A lot of people have different things that help them cope. My husband tends to bury himself in video games. A friend I had once would constantly binge watch shows. My dad's a workaholic. Etc. Everyone has something that genuinely helps cut out everything. And unfortunately, mine includes talking to people. Which is ironic because I hate the process of meeting people ad making friends. But I know when I'm on the phone with someone or out with people (and we're active), my mind just shuts up. And where there's usually a ball of tension in my chest, there's just an empty, lighter feeling.  it's more reliant on people I care about, but overall, the task of interacting with someone trumps feeling sorry for myself. Every. ingle. Time. That's hyperbolic. But most of the time, it works.  after spending all this time constantly being around people and being busy and being around my husband, I can genuinely call what I'm experiencing a ""crash."" And it's really hard to keep myself feeling okay, when the only thing here for me right now is my bed and the consistent sound of the air conditioner shutting on and off in intervals.  can't even bring myself to go out and introduce myself to the neighbors. Or walk around the neighborhood to find the public dumpster. My mind runs a mile a minute and the only thoughts I have are, ""omething is going to go wrong.""  on my phone or laptop is a trap because I've started habitually looking for ""angel numbers"" as a sign that things are going to be okay, but instead of it bringing a sense of relief to me, it ends up making me obsess over the real meaning of it. Even though it could mean nothing! Or I search for signs elsewhere. Like, if I watch this movie and it mentions a couple breaking up because the husband cheated, is that a warning for me? Did I choose *this* specific movie and have that be a plotpoint in it because it'll happen to me? Or, this song I like is about a man sharing a relationship with a woman and saying he can't be ""faithful for long"" and the song is a duration of 4 minutes and 16 seconds, which is coincidentally the month and day of my birth. 4/16. Does that mean my man won't want to stay with me?  exists normally for me right now. I've become obsessive with whether everything is going to be okay. I worry that everything is a sign and if it's ""good"" then I wonder if I'm just pretending that something is a good omen and if it's ""bad"" then I convince myself that, that is the truth.  find myself looking up statistics of marriage-divorce ratios between couples that marry early and those that wait. And I take the fact that, statistically speaking, we won't last the first 5 years before divorcing to heart.  if that isn't bad enough, my constant paranoia and anxiety regarding my relationship and just anything good that's happened to me being taken away in a heartbeat just makes me so, so angry at myself. It kickstarts a whole different set of thoughts. Because after I reach a point, it becomes ""you're the reason everything is going to go wrong"" versus ""everything will go wrong because people change.""  isn't a huge change, but significant enough for my emotion to be changed from sadness to unadulterated hate for myself. I get trapped in a cycle of KNOWING that thinking these things is irrational and that I'm forcing myself to imagine these negative outcomes without there actually being any real, genuine signs of it being true. And the thought process of, ""well, you freak out so much and worry about all of these things happening that eventually you'll end up pushing the one person you never want to live without away because they'll never want to deal with someone as pathetic as you!""  traps me.  at the end of the day, I just know I'll be screaming my heart out asking myself, ""Why?? Why can't you just be normal?! Why can't you just believe in him? Why can't you just believe in yourself?! Why can't you do anything?!""  it's horrible. And scary. Because I get so mad. o, so mad at myself. I just start hitting myself. And the fear gets worse. And I start thinking I'm crazy. I'm going insane. No one could love someone like me. No one could handle someone like me. I'm terrifying.  it's hard. Because this happens all the time. And it just keep repeating and repeating. And even though I share everything with my husband, even the fact that I feel this way and that I have episodes like this. Even though he's witnessed me freak out. Even though he knows how I am and constantly reassures me that it's okay. That he loves me. That everyone needs help. That he doesn't want anyone else. That he's never leaving. That we're in this together through thick and thin. That we exchanged our vows for a reason and that this marriage isn't just something fickle and meaningless. That it was a promise.  still can't get out of my own head. And I try so hard to remember his words and reassurances and everything he's done for me. But when I start shutting down, it's like everyone and everything just becomes so much farther away. And I get scared that I'll never be able to do anything. That all my dreams and the life I want with my husband will all become unobtainable because I can't stop thinking.  scary. It really is. And it makes me feel as though I come off ungrateful and unappreciative. Like I'm pushing every heartfelt response and genuine reassurance to the side. But it's not that. It isn't. Because I savor it all. And I appreciate it all. It just takes so long for me to believe it. I feel so much love and appreciation for so much, that nothing ever feels like enough when I want to return it all back.  I wonder what happened to me. Like if there's a reason I'm like this or if I was just born this way. I don't know. I gave myself a headache typing all this out, lmao.  someone actually read all this, WOW, you're amazing.

Anxiety,"Every evening when I start my bedtime routine (brushing my teeth, stuff like that), I get hit with a wave of anxiety. It is hard to explain how it feels--it's constant and does not really go away until I fall asleep. In a way, it feels like a sense of dread or that I am on edge about something bad that is going to happen. I have no ideas as to what that may be because more often than not, the anxiety happens out of the blue when I am thinking of nothing in particular.  is no obvious trigger except for it being nighttime. I have even tried changing up my routine but that did not work. It happens every evening around the same time and gets worse when I turn out the lights.  makes me feel the need to tell those close to me (such as my fiancé and parents) that I love them, sometimes repeatedly. Does anyone else experience this or something similar? Is there a name for it?Anxiety at night",1635135708,896,173

Anxiety,"Title pretty much says it all. My anxiety has been on and off recently, but what’s been killing me has been the negative self-talk and intrusive thoughts aspect of anxiety. It gets really bad at night, and sometimes I want to harm myself because I feel all this guilt and shame.  feel extremely guilty about my situation, even though I KNOW I shouldn’t. My anxiety makes me beat myself up over the small mistakes, and I feel so bad about myself. I am trying to do better things for myself, but it hasn’t helped much. I don’t like asking for encouragement, because I shouldn’t always seek external validation from others. Then I keep listening to the bad voice in my head and I can’t stop. I want to cry most nights because having this consistent negative self-talk is exhausting. It takes a single thought to shift mindsets, but having this voice always in the back of my head makes me used to it.  don’t know why I listen to the negative self-talk. It makes my anxiety so much worse. But I don’t open up because I don’t want to be a burden to others either. You could almost never tell I’m struggling because I’m also really good at hiding my emotions. I almost had a panic attack in the show because my mind got trapped in a negative thought cycle. Almost every day is tough in terms of anxiety and this negative self-talk.  encouraging words and a hug would feel great, I know I’m the person that needs to put in the work to fix my problems. Like I said, I don’t really like asking for validation, mainly because I think people see it as attention-seeking. Going back to the guilt, it’s hard to explain how much of it I feel at times it’s so bad. I know I’m not perfect, but I can’t help but be hard on myself, which just kills my self-worth even more.  know, people don’t define my worth, and neither does my anxiety. I’m a child of God, and He has put in this spot for a reason, and the things anxiety tells me are lies. But lately, I’ve felt lost and alone. I don’t know why I’ve been telling this way. I want to cry. I want to scream. This is all so tiring. Both mentally and physically. It’s overwhelming too.

Anxiety," This sounds so stupid… Anyway, my mum recently asked me to take my dog for a walk - which I was more than happy to do - but I took a rather long time to prepare myself which she was really pissed off about. suffer a lot with depression, which I never really felt supported by family regarding the ‘mental health’ department. Well, for the past month I have been falling into really bad habits again (waking up at 2pm, watching tv all day, binge eating, etc…) and on the 30th day of the month I decided to wake up earlier, make my bed, clean room (I know this sounds like normal expected responsibilities but I struggle to do ‘simple’ tasks, on a day to day basis).  mum started getting impatient with me after her constant nagging for me to take my dog out, which I understand that I was taking a long time. As I was putting my shoes on, getting ready to take him out, she storms into my room lays on my bed, refuses to leave, then starts ripping off my sheets, ripping down photos on my wall, throwing things around in my room (this really upset because I felt like that day was a fresh start).  stupidly decided to yank her off my bed. I attempt to get her out of my room (I don’t like it when people invade my personal space). But she won’t leave my room - at this point I refused to take my dog out, because I don’t like being told what to do.  don’t know what overcame me but I shoved her really hard in attempt to push her out of my room (I really understand that this was wrong of me). I felt rage after she ruined my room, so I went to her wardrobe and started tearing everything down. ended up back next to each other, and I don’t know who initiated it but I just remembered her yanking my hair so I did the same, we were kicking each other, and then some point she ended up on the floor. Again, I don’t know what overcame me but when she was on the floor I punched her really hard on the back repeatedly and kicked her really hard repeatedly.  on, I rushed off to my bathroom, hysterically crying. I had a really bad panic attack which led to me attacking my arm with scissors (I usually H when I’m overwhelmed). I felt so awful and ashamed so I took a lot of paracetamol - hoping that I would die (it obviously didn’t work).  just feel so guilty and ashamed. I hope that the aggression within me will never resurface. I keep replaying the event in my mind and can’t deal with the guilt, it’s killing me. My mum and I have already forgiven each other. But this constant sensation of guilt is so overwhelming. I know I deserve this state of mind, but at some point I need to learn, forgive and hopefully let go. I can’t be tormented by this shame and regret forever. Please help. I really need advice on how to move on and grow. I don’t know if this is relevant, but when I was around 13 - my mum and I were doing maths homework (maths isn’t my specialty) and I just couldn’t get this one equation. My mum then randomly starts punching me really hard in my head, multiple times, over a maths problem??? Then to top it off, chucks a wine glass in my face. - This left an emotional mark (I don’t know why). My mum and I never addressed it. There was also this one particular incident with my dad around a year ago (I was 15), we had an argument just after I woke up - I was still in bed - (for some reason I decided to sleep naked). Anyway, my dad screamed at me to get out of bed, but I refused because of obvious reasons. He got so angry he dug his knee into my stomach, got onto of me (he’s 6ft’6), put his hand around my throat, hit me across the face multiple times, and I screamed at him telling him I couldn’t breathe. anytime had passed, he kicked me out the house (with no shoes), threw my shoes at me aggressively. I called my other family members in shock (as it was rare for my family to be physical) yet it was never addressed again after. I return home, my dad yanks me by my arms across the floor then goes on to scream at me some more, telling me: I’m a “disappointment” and that my mental health issues are “fake”. statement really left a mark. My family know that I have struggled with depression and anxiety for pretty much my whole life. I also have issues with trust and sharing my feelings - they’re very much aware of this, as they encourage me to share more with the family. My dads comment was inspired by my evil step mum who despises my siblings and I, as well as my mum, whom she’s never met before.I felt my feelings were really invalidated by that remark, it really hurt. family really love each other. I love them so much and I feel so grateful for them. However, those physical incidences that have occurred, make me feel like absolute shit. know that I messed up so badly, I feel disgusted and regretful of my idiotic actions.

Anxiety," first time experiencing anxiety/sadness was 6 years ago started around November one day I was suddenly shaking super hot sweating heart aches and crying for no apparent reason it lasted a long time about 6-8 months before I started to have more good days than bad. After 8 months I never felt that way again until 3 weeks ago. It all started when I got a puppy ( which I have now rehomed ). 2 days after getting the puppy I started to experience the urge to cry for no apparent reason and overthinking everything that wasn’t even worrying me. It’s been like this since then, reminds me a lot of 6 years ago but not as bad, but still sucks to feel like this. I’ve rehomed the puppy but still through the days have random moments when I feel it anxiety and sadness and it’ll randomly go away and I’ll be fine again. I now have 2 children and some days are harder than others but I manage to pull through. I just miss how I felt 1 month ago completely happy all day.

Anxiety,"I've been talking to a counselor for a few months now and he has encouraged me to consider taking ADHD and anxiety meds, but he is unable to prescribe them.

Anxiety,"I started playing Valorant in August and I have a lor of fun playing it and asked a friend to join me. Let's call her Melly. Melly and I are highschool friends but we dun really talk that often because she's not the type to respond to texts. o Valorant is the only time where we talk regularly in Discord voice call. met a guy called Jason in Valorant and we invited him to the Discord server as we have been playing with him for several days and he's a fun, nontoxic player so the three of us quickly become friends. forward to October, my classes are starting so I couldn't really play Valorant every night as I used to. Plus I'm in a long distance relationship so I call my boyfriend everyday before I go to sleep. I usually play Valorant from 12 am to 2 am and my bedtime is usually 2 am so if I'm calling my boyfriend I usually dun play Valorant unless it's a day that I can sleep in. just feel kinda bad since Jake and Melly are getting closer to each other and I feel left out, I guess. Melly stays at home with her family and she's not working and studying at the moment so she's free to play Valorant every night. I play with them a few times a week of course but the feeling is still there. Neither Melly or Jake treats me any differently, it's just that I am scared of being left out and not part of the gang anymore. help on how to overcome this, I think this is purely in my head so I want a solution that doesn't involve me talking about this to Jake and Melly, thanks.

Anxiety,"Last night I went out to a bar and made some new friends (bar staff and two members of the band who play there) - when the bar closed, me and one of the guys from the band walked to a local store to phone a taxi. We waited 20 minutes and still no taxi, so we phoned again. We waited for another 10/15 minutes and that one didn’t show either. It was pouring of rain and extremely windy (we live in cotland lmao) so he offered to let me wait in his garage so we could get out of the wind and rain. We walked to his place and phoned another taxi from his garage - the taxi showed up about 10 minutes later and I went home. When I got home, my mum accused me of sleeping with this guy - I have been in a relationship for just over a year and I would NEVER cheat but she immediately accused me of it. It made me extremely anxious because I thought that maybe my boyfriend felt the same way so I called him and we talked. He said that he trusts me but the situation still made him feel uncomfortable because he doesn’t know the guy. That’s completely understandable and I would feel the same, but I can’t stop feeling anxious and like I’ve done something extremely wrong and will be in trouble.  can’t eat and I keep throwing up even though I know it’s fine, the anxiety is killing me and I don’t know what to doAccused of something I didn’t do",1635122380,1338,266

Im 18, still in highschool, and I get extremely anxious about other people's perceptions of me. On one hand, of course I want to wear the ring. I love him. He loves me. No shame in that.

Anxiety,"I always struggled with depression and several personality disorders since I can remember. I got diagnosed and I've had different kinds of therapy for almost 10 years now. Tried different kinds of medicine and was kinda managing for a while, I still struggle with my abandonment issues but I got myself under control. Then came anxiety and all I had built for myself began falling apart.I am so anxious, leaving the house or even having someone over often feels impossible. My anxiety is also linked to irritable bowel snydrome, so I'm constantly afraid of shitting myself in front of others lol. Well because of this I haven't been able to do anything really, working or university seems impossible. Before anxiety I somehow managed going to school and university, but it was always very irregular and severely mentally challenging and when I started getting anxiety it became impossible. an extrovert and suffer so much from not being able to meet people. I now 'only' have a best friend and a boyfriend. I had another friend but he is emotionally very cold and triggers my abandonment issues, so we can't really be close anymore. My best friend is very introverted and socially anxious, he also has aspergers. Before anxiety I helped him with social interaction and getting friends. He was grateful and kind to me, but keeps doing stuff that really hurts me, without doing them on purpose. Most of the friends I had before are now his friends, since I am too anxious too meet them. My best friend is thriving and having a good time with my boyfriend and all the other people and it makes me hate them. know this isn't right but it hurts so much when they tell me about how much fun they're having without me. I never complained, just told them to maybe not tell me about this that much anymore, because I'm sad I can't be with them. My best friend keeps triggering me but when I tell him he reacts very emotionally (he can't really control his reaction apparently) and starts to feel bad about himself and stuff. Like for example I once had an anxiety attack and told them to please change the topic because this was causing me anxiety. I usually hide those attacks, which then cause me  more severe physical symptoms.o when I told him his whole face changed to sad/zoned out kinda and since I am very susceptible to other people's feelings it made my anxiety worse. Then he started crying and telling me he feels like he's a bad friend and stuff, in the middle of the supermarket we were in. It made my anxiety even more worse, we were on our way to a social gathering which was a huge step for me to take. I had to be there for him and comfort him and felt sorry for him but this is the kind of reaction I get when I tell him how I feel. It makes my situation worse. I don't feel safe around him anymore when it comes to my anxiety, because I have to be there for him in a situation when actually I'm the one who needs help.I feel like I never voice my problems to him because he has so many problems of his own but I always try to help him whenever I can and try not to trigger him in any way, so I walk on eggshells and I often didn't do what I would've preferred just to make him happy. He is very oblivious to any of my needs and keeps hurting me without knowing it. It's very hard for me to tell him, since he reacts that way and because I feel like an idiot for having those feelings of anxiety or jealousy or whatever. We often talk about our problems, so he actually knows very much about my stuff, but it's like he can't apply them to his own actions.I know it's not his intention to hurt me and I need to address this somehow but tso many things have been adding up and I have so many negative emotions in me now. For example I usually was able to deal with my inferiority complex because he's better at most of the things we do. Only thing I had was my social life. But now that this is gone it all keeps dragging me down so much. Every hobbie I start he immediately is better at it. Every person we meet is more interested in him. I don't even meet anyone anymore, all those friends hang out with him now. It makes me so very jealous and because of this eggshell walking I feel like I'm being treated unfair, constantly thinking about his wellbeing but getting not the same stuff in return. I know he is just oblivious to it which makes it even worse telling him. feel like I'm the problem and that I should just get my shit together and stop being so anxious and bitter but I keep working on myself all the time and I just want people to please consider my needs, too, even if they may be a bit demanding at first. If they don't want to that's ok, too. One close friend already told me I'm too much sometimes and I accepted this, even tho it makes me feel even worse about myself. I don't want to be a burden but I also want someone to give me the same kind of attention and care I give them. fear I'm losing all my friends because I can't be happy for them because I feel left out all the time, I feel like my needs are not seen or heard or appropriately handled when I can express them. I miss my old life, I miss being free and not constricted to my mental prison. I feel like I'm a bad person for being so bitter and negative and that nobody likes me anyway and while I want to be seen and heard I also feel like I'm just a burden and nobody makes me feel like I'm not, while I try everything to not make people feel this way.

Anxiety,"Hello all, hope that whoever is reading this is having a good day. just joined this thread because I'm currently at a breaking point. I am hoping that there may be some insights here that can help, because so far medication/therapy hasn't been particularly helpful (currently I'm looking for a new therapist). My apologies in advance for the length of this, I have so much on my mind and it's just sort of pouring out. am a 24 year old female, and moved from CA to New England in February to study at a premedical post-bacc program (I was a psych major as an undergrad, but realized I wanted to become a doctor during my senior year). It's kind of a weird situation, because I'm older than the undergrads in my current classes, and around the same age as the graduate students. In spring all classes were remote, so coming back in person for the fall semester has been so, so weird and awkward, to say the least. was diagnosed with GAD at 11, then MDD, ADHD and later social phobia in high school. I've never had many friends, and was bullied a lot as an adolescent, which led me to start hiding in bathrooms at lunch time/avoiding making social plans/etc.. I've never been in a romantic relationship, either. home, my father was both verbally and at times physically abusive. I have two older brothers, but we have pretty big age difference (with 6 &amp; 10 years, respectively) and have never been terribly close. My mom was by far my biggest advocate growing up, and helped me get the care I needed when I was first experiencing symptoms. he was extremely social, and just one of those magnetic people that everyone loves being around. he didn't really understand why I was so fearful of others because of her extroverted personality, but still made every effort to support me. he sadly passed away from brain cancer when I was 17. feel insecure about my appearance a lot of the time, due to having scoliosis and a form of alopecia (my hair loss is still in an okay place but definitely worsening). was struggling a lot during the pandemic at home in CA, when it became clear to me just how distant I had grown from the few friends I did have. Everyone was pursuing new jobs, grad school and other exciting endeavors, and I just felt left in the dust. I've always felt like I cared so much more about my friends (because of the precious few of them I had) and enjoyed spending time with them, more than they did me. Because of this, I felt more comfortable isolating myself, than risking feeling as though I was wasting anyone's time or feeling rejected. This just put more distance between myself and everyone else, and made it so that when opportunities to socialize did come up, I didn't know how to act. I just feel fundamentally unlikeable. had to stop seeing the psychiatrist I had been seeing for years in CA once I left, and when they didn't really say anything at the end of our last meeting (acknowledging the time they had been treating me, wishing me well, etc.), for some reason I felt even worse. I felt like I had just annoyed them with my awkwardness. Nevertheless, as pathetic as it sounds, I miss the consistency of having someone to talk to monthly. I first moved back East, I enjoyed being in school from the comfort of home, experiencing real winter weather for the first time, and decorating my apartment in the way I had always dreamed of. But now that months have gone by, and I've only really had one real social gathering with the people in my cohort of post-bacc students, I feel so empty. It is so hard to find it in myself to even do basic things like keeping my apartment clean and personal hygiene (my ADHD definitely factors into this. I eat mostly takeout food, and spend 99% of the time alone. I feel incompetent every time I talk to anyone, and feel like my awkwardness just spills over into whatever I'm doing. I've tried asking the people in my cohort over text if they were free, but no plans ever were made. We laugh and are nice to each other in person when class is going on, but that's really the extent of it. mentioned that I'm struggling to several friends from home, but none of them really say anything in response except that they are sorry/don't follow up with me about how I'm doing. They only seem to want to talk when something exciting is happening in their lives (I have several friends applying to/starting med school, etc. ). I try my best to show my enthusiasm and support for them, but it just makes me feel worse/left behind. family doesn't follow up either, and just reaching out to people to complain about the pathetic state of my life, I imagine, would be off-putting. I started seeing a new psychologist in February, which again was nice to have in my schedule regularly, but recently decided to try to find a new one that I could connect with more. I felt like I wasn't being completely honest about everything going on/was saying what I thought would get them to like me. (Totally not the point of therapy) the moment, I'm sitting on my couch, scrolling through my instagram feed and crying because I am wasting my life. I just want to make friends, go out /date like my 20something peers do. I want to find people who care about me just as much as I do them, be ""likeable"" and feel fulfilled. I just don't know where to begin. I'm thinking of getting a cat or some other small animal to keep me company, until things maybe get better.

Anxiety,"My therapist can help with techniques like cbt and whatever, but when she gives me suicide hotlines, domestic abuse hotlines to call when I'm alone or scared it makes me feel even sadder. If I had someone on a personal level to talk to, to keep me grounded..... just to help me with things occasionally I wouldn't feel like I'm dying every second of every day. It is killing me having no one there for me, not really. and if I reach out to others, whether that be in a romantic sense, or friendship wise, they rarely  entertain the conversation and even then it ends as quickly as it started. I hate it so much. Most of the time when the anxiety spikes, when the loneliness digs its claws into me and I reach out I don't really even get a response. A seen, or a like for my message if I'm lucky. I just want someone to be there for me like I am for them, I just want someone to genuinely value me as a person. For us to be a team.

Anxiety,o I’ve been using computers my whole life since I was about 3 or 4. Most of the time I used my own Mac that I got in 2015. I just played games on it until it died in 2018. Last year I decided to get a new computer because of online classes and to play games. Literally just less than a month after I got it I already had a virus. I was able to get rid of it but ever since then I could never use it for more that 20 minutes. The fans would get to loud or a game would be slow and I’d be scared something was wrong with it. And it didn’t help that it was really expensive. I sold to my sister a month or two ago and she’s had no problems with it.

This post contains mentions of A and suicidal thoughts.  everyone :) This story might be a bit heavy for some, so I’d advise you to read this only if you feel okay mentally/emotionally to hold space for me. Thank you to all of you &lt;3 an 18yo girl and I have anxiety. I actually just got diagnosed but I’ve felt it for a while. I have a difficult situation at home because my mom is mentally ill and refuses to get help. I know it’s really hard, it took me 3 years to gain the courage. The problem is that my moms mental health has affected how she’s treated me for most of my childhood. There’s too much to explain but I have to listen to her say really horrible things to me almost on a daily basis.  this year I dated a guy. I thought he was really lovely and we were good friends first but I hadn’t known him for very long. When he told me he had feelings for me I felt I should warn him that I dealt with quite serious mental health issues. I tried to explain as much as possible without overwhelming him. He seemed very understanding and empathetic.  dated for less than a year. I was happy with him and I loved him. I thought we had a good, healthy relationship. What happened was that I had a bad panic attack and I felt like I didn’t want to be alive anymore. I had sort of reached a peak. I was scared and so I told him. He knew that I had been struggling a lot recently so this was not a huge shock to him, however, as he was scared he told his parents. This frightened me as my own parents have never supported me but I knew my boyfriend did the right thing telling his, and I trusted him. He told me that they were just worried for me but that they loved me and just wanted to help.  they proceeded with is what hurt me a lot. First, they gave us a specific window of time during which we could speak to each other (it was very long and there were no exceptions.) There was no explanation and the parents never spoke to me directly even though we had been very close. I couldn’t see my boyfriend either, as he was in another country for a month. I was afraid, and since they had contacted my parents without realizing how that might actually worsen my situation (which it did), I felt more isolated than ever.  a week after my panic attack, my boyfriend broke up with me. I got a call in the morning and he told me I had ten minutes to talk and that that would be the last time I’d ever hear from him. He spent the majority of those ten minutes blaming me for everything. I didn’t even know what to say, I didn’t have time to process anything. Just 12h earlier he had told me how much he loved me and he had promised we would see each other again. On the call, however, he claimed that he stopped loving me the night of my bad panic. He also called me selfish and said the whole relationship was all about me. I’d like to say that I think I put in just as much effort as him. I brought him surprises and gifts despite coming from a much less privileged family. I took part in all of his interests. I made sure to check him and asked if he was feeling okay. I was there when he cried. He had some trouble communicating his feelings but I tried to help by initiating conversations about how we could make each other feel more secure or appreciated in our relationship. He was there for me as well and he was kind and considerate of my anxiety. I never expected him to tell me that I should have apologized for my panic attacks (actually I did apologize every time.) the phone call his entire family (even extended) and best friend blocked me everywhere; I was even removed from gcs that weren’t even being used. It still hurts like hell because I loved them all (and still do) and I cant even be angry with them because they meant everything to me. To make matters worse, my boyfriends parents told my friend’s family (they’re close) that he and everyone else in the family were the victims.  come up as you’re trying to heal. They’re not always good. While we were still dating, my boyfriend once asked to have sex a short time after I had had a panic attack. I should’ve said no but I thought I’d be fine. At some point during, I passed out. I woke up to him still going at it. I don’t remember it well enough but I told him that I had passed out and he just got up and looked confused. I need brought it up with him because I assumed he didn’t notice. However, my closest friend told me about some things he had said way back which changed the way I saw him. I don’t want to disclose what it was to protect my friend but it wasn’t great.  he never came back and I didn’t hear from him again. I struggle with a lot of guilt and shame but I’m mostly just incredibly confused. I was never given a chance to speak up for myself and these people kept making decisions affecting my health behind my back even after they chose to leave me. For months now, I’ve had nightmares. It feels a little unfair, especially considering how privileged they are. I miss them a lot and I’d like to say that they were super friendly to me before all of this happened and I still think they are great people who just misjudged a situation.  Btw, I’m in the process of getting help now. It’s very slow where I live and I can’t afford private therapy so I’m just taking it day by day. Just wanted to tell y’all in case you were worried. Thanks for listening :)Hi I would just like to share a bit of my story because I don’t have anyone else to tell if that’s okay.",1635112723,5465,1063

I look like a zombie.A bunch of things I need to do are collapsing with each other in the back of my head but I don't feel strong enough to focus on one thing at a time, it feels too heavy.Not working out + bad habits + depression + stressful job +  malnourishment + terrible sleep + social anxiety = hell.

There's only shame, intrusive thoughts, anxiety, paranoia, depression and disappointment. I thought I could achieve many things in this lifetime but turns out I'm my biggest obstacle.

Anxiety,"Hi, I'm using a throaway account for this as my friends know my normal reddit username. is a long post so please be patient. I am applying for Masters (course beginning in fall 2022). The application process has started from the beginning of October. I am from outh Asia and I'm applying abroad (one of the factors being that the field &amp; course I'm passionate about isn't available around here much) have applied for a Masters before, quite a while before Covid even started, and I hadn't been able to go through with it because of multiple factors, the biggest one being the inability to arrange finances for the course I had gotten into at that time (I had not been selected for any scholarship unfortunately). spent time after that doing Part-Time work, multiple internships &amp; volunteer work. I am applying this year again and my mental state has taken an extreme turn I think. I have suffered from crippling anxiety for as long as I can remember so that's not new. Even when I had applied for Masters the first time, I had been anxious beyond belief, scared, nervous, you name it. But I had been excited at the same time. I had had this weird adrenaline rush through the whole exhausting application process and I had pulled through. this time, it's as if I'm unable to physically lift a damn finger to even open my laptop to start the process. I'm sitting here, I just watched the whole month of October just pass by and I haven't started a single application. I have already messed it up and wasted so much time. And I feel it in real time. I feel the fear and wastefulness but for some reason I'm not acting upon it. I keep thinking about it and I think I finally realized that I am so anxious of starting the essay, of potential rejection or a bad outcome that I just am not starting in the first place. get me wrong, I am excited and passionate about the Masters. It's all I've been looking forward to and strategizing for, for the past so many months. But as soon as the date of applications began, something turned upside down. am really scared, I am damaging my own chances. I will regret every second I waste I know that. I just don't know what's happening to me. How can you see and feel your destruction in real time and still not act upon it? really need some advice for this. What can I do, how can I work with this now?Anxiety is crippling my ability to do important work. How can I deal with this?",1635110966,2424,448
Anxiety,"When I message someone, I often worry about offending them or saying something weird, this is probably common. it's so much worse with online friends because the only connection you have can be stopped forever with one click.

The message always comes but it doesn't get any better with time. Of course it gets worse and worse the longer they take to respond. sucks because it's someone I like talking to but this fear just makes it so stressful, It's not even logical because this person has said positive stuff about me a lot, but I can't get rid of the fear that they will stop talking to me forever out of nowhere.

Anxiety,"Hello. I feel like I’m a broken record on this subreddit. As I’m writing this I’m feeling symptoms, and my health anxiety is making things none the easier. Every pain I feel and every problem I may or may not have I’m thinking it’s life-threatening. A little bit of acid reflux, a chest pain, headache, any sort of numb feeling or tingles I’ll make me think something bad is going to happen soon.  is been going on for weeks now and I’m not used to it as you can imagine. I have a doctors appointment coming up where I hope to discuss all of this but in my current situation I’m quite scared. I’ve talk to a lot of people about this and also tried to reassure myself I’m going to be fine and next thing you know I’m worrying once more the same level of panic I felt before. One of the few things that genuinely make me feel better is talking about it whether it be online or in person.  of the terrible mistakes I made when I first started feeling all this was going on the Internet and looking at my symptoms. Everything I read pointed to a heart attack or something else and next thing you know I was in the emergency room. As you probably heard the story before everything was fine they found nothing and I just got sent home wondering if they missed something. It’s been nothing but an uphill battle for about four weeks now and I have to juggle a job with a good amount of responsibility and a lot of things going on at home. I’ve had so much worry about my health ever since then that it’s killing me. I feel bad eating anything that’s not good or healthy, water or greens, That sort of thing. When I exert myself I feel my chest and feel my beating heart which should be normal, however I get really worried about it now. You may see this is rambling or what have you but unfortunately this is just how I feel about all of this and it’s tough to get my mind off of it. Just sitting there accepting this is how I’m feeling and not trying to worry about it almost seems impossible. I can’t just turn off my brain and say “oh yes this pain and feeling is completely normal it’s all my anxiety and I shouldn’t worry about it at all”.  of my aunts felt heartburn then five minutes later she had a heart attack and ended up in a vegetative state, eventually dying. That’s been heavy on my mind throughout all of this as well. I don’t know what more to say this is all really a rant/vent/whatever the hell it is, I don’t even know what I’m looking for here.

My main fear is losing control of my mind and the more I am afraid the more my mind gets out of control and I have random racing thoughts.  fact, especially when I'm tired and / or very anxious my mind speeds up and it's like so much random, meaningless information jostling each other: images, sounds, words, pieces of sentences heard. ..  last point really freaks me out because I think every time it's the start of verbal hallucinations, my brain is able to transcribe the sound of the voices of the people I heard. (Besides, I also sometimes have earworms with music but also with the accent or intonation of someone with whom I spent a little time). want to clarify that my psychiatrist told me it was anxiety but I'm still worried in reality.  you think these are hallucinations?  are your racing thougts my anxious buddies? 😄How are your racing thoughts ? Did I loose my mind ?",1635102322,1057,194
Anxiety,"I literally forgot about the time when I used to avoid people's eyes, stares. I used to look down; right at the floor, drilling holes or pretended to be on the phone all the damn time. Until last year.  some unknown reason last year, I legit started by looking back at people who glanced/stared at me. ome of them moments were hilarious since none of us(me and the stranger) backed down. oon enough, I started giving out smiles whenever someone glanced at me. I got more smiles back than people who didn't. It felt really nice, friendly gesture which made me actually look around me instead of looking at the floor. It boosted my self esteem, perhaps? Made me less anxious in public. came the masks. Loved the mask, made me felt secure. yet I didn't stop giving out the smiles. I guess the people saw the crinkles surrounding my eyes which made them smile back at me. It was sweet of them. I don't really smile like a weirdo all the time, but few moments here and there, haha.Smile.(:",1635102159,984,180
Anxiety,"I was honored to be one of my friend's bridesmaids although I feel like I don't deserve it due to the lack of closeness. I met her through my husband's best friend a couple of years ago, and they're getting married in a few weeks. They have 2-3 wedding events: Turkish henna night, ceremony with the parentals / older people, and civil wedding. this dance. It's the traditional Turkish henna night where the bridesmaids dance around the bride. he showed me the video for the dance routine idea. It's like almost 4 minutes long, and I'm pretty sure it's going to be the longest 4 minutes of my life. the lame klutz and extremely introverted I am, I'm freaking tf out and don't like attention. And the fact that I'm deaf makes it worse because I know I will be out of sync not being able to follow the music rhythm with the girls. I kindly explained this to my friend and she keeps insisting that everything will be fine and she very much would love for me to be part of this dance - whether or not I mess it up. super sweet to encourage me to take part, but I'm *scared* :( How to cope this?

Anxiety,"Hi everybody, I am a 20 y.o. guy who is dealing with anxiety and depression but even though I got better in the last month there are few things that haunt me. One of this is related to my birthday, that happened in august. o, to give you context, I'm in this group of 4 friends, including me, made of a couple, another guy and me. In august me and the other guy decided to make a gift for the 3rd guy's birthday. When we gave him the gift my and his birthday already occurred and, even though I said it wasn't necessary, him and his girlfriend insisted on saying that they wanted to make a gift for me. I have plenty of problems with my birthday, 'cause most of the people during the years didn't care about it, and when they said they cared about me and really wanted to make me a gift I was actually very happy. Unfortunately 2 months has passed and the gift has never arrived. I don't care about the gift itself actually, but I'm more hurted by the fact they said it would have come for sure and they cared about me. Obviously I started overthinking because I don't know what really happened t the gift and the idea of it, and during this last week the thoughts have become more intense because we worked (me and the couple) on finding a gift for the other guy's birthday. I have talked about it with my psychologist but we need to face the topic again. My question is what should I do to feel better about this? hould I talk to them or I should ignore the topic to not result inappropriate? We are really close friend and we know about each others problem, so they know about my anxiety.

In work I will replay every interaction in great detail and analyze even meaningless convsrsations that others probably forget about immediately. I wil replay the events of my day right down to the minute and if I can remember what I was dojng at a certain time I just feel to anxious.

Everyone seems to be passing the buck. real kicker is that I ran out of some of my medications on Wednesday of last week and it's really shaking me up.  I didn't realize how huge of an effect they had until I had to stop them cold turkey.  I've had 5-10 panic attacks every day starting on Wednesday of last week.

Anxiety,"I've been struggling with mild anxiety for some long time but when I look back at how I was, I can say that I've come a long way in dealing with it in the past 2 years. anxiety is still here, almost as bad as it has always been, but most of the time I can mentally push through or close my mind for a short period of time (although in this case, the awkwardness and ""cringe"" will hit back later in the day).  I'm trying to fix right now is the fact that, while I can ""mentally push through"" and fake some degree of confidence, I can't control how my body reacts.  I'm anxious, I'm very jittery. For example:  If I'm holding something in my hand I will surely drop it sooner or later. * If I'm trying to do something with my hands that requires some small degree of accuracy (e.g. fitting a key into a key hole) I will struggle. * Lately I've developed a hand tremor and it also gets way worse when I'm anxious/stressed. * If I'm walking there's a a big possibility I will stumble a little or hit a table/bench/etc (when I forget to actively scan my surrounding so that things like this don't happen).* I stumble my words (although I can mostly control this if I'm able to make myself slow down the rate I'm talking at).* When I'm anticipating an event that I'm anxious about, sometimes I get chills that make me shiver, even though the room temperature is warm. This is especially odd because rarely do I feel cold, most of the time I find the temperature to be too warm.* I've been told that my skin flushes very easily (I know my palms randomly redden sometimes but I didn't realise that my whole skin does this) .* I find it very hard to fall asleep/stay asleep when there's the smallest hint of stress in my life (things such as simply having to go somewhere the next day even though it's not in the morning or stressful in any way will kill my sleep). This lately has forced me to get between only 3-6 hours of sleep night after night.* I find it almost impossible to stop my mind and concentrate on how to do something (e.g. fit a car fuel cap back on when I've never done that before) and it feels like I am just driven by instinct in such situations (and I always hope it's good enough but it doesn't really work out too well).* I also find it very hard to follow instructions/remember details when I'm in this state.  not sure if it's the most precise description, but it feels like I'm very frequently in a ~~fight~~ or **flight** response, being driven by instinct and not the rational part of my mind.

Turned out to be a small cyst that is now gone. During that, it switched to heart anxiety. I was having palpitations, and I went to my doctors and had an ELG done, which was normal. till was panicking every day about it. Then, about two weeks ago, I began to have yellowish-brown stools. My heart anxiety is basically gone now, and has switched entirely to anxiety around my bowel movements. I'm convinced I have pancreatic cancer or some other incurable disease.

It's been mighty rough fight to even convince myself that anxiety was the route of my problems. But I remind myself that there's very few conditions that cause my symptoms and also thaty symptoms often change which is not standard for serious health conditions either. I got a new symptom when I tried to go to bed last night that essentially felt like a small bug biting under my left breast a bunch of times in a row. It scared me to the point where I almost ended up in the hospital. My lovely partner drove me to the ER and waited with me in the parking lot while I tried to decide if it was anxiety or real life. Today he's at work and I'm alone with the kids. I felt the pain again briefly this morning just after he left. And I have to keep reminding myself that the pain was brought on by fear of being alone. The dizzy spells are what triggers my anxiety now, and I know they'll fade as I continue taking the medication, also keep trying to eat (worked my way up from a single fruit and handful of nuts all the way to at least most of a full meal per day in addition), and hopefully get a few real nights sleep. It's hard because my logical brain knows anxiety makes my symptoms but it's so hard not to feel dismissed or down right stupid.

I'm sorry if it comes across rambly or scattered, my thoughts are pretty scattered right now. always been someone who's struggled with anxiety/depression since I was about 17-18, I'm 27 now. I was on RIs when I was 17 and didn't stay on them for long as I was not fond of the side effects, I was on Cipralex at this time. ince then I have always been able to manage my anxiety and depression but earlier this week everything kind of blew up. tress and anxiety from my high stress work environment, as well as the end of a relationship have caused me to severely relapse into depressive and suicidal thoughts. I woke up around 3am on Wednesday night, cold sweats and labored breathing. All I could think about was killing myself. It was extremely intense, my brain was convincing me that it was such a good idea. I was going to go the the emergency room but I knew they would admit me for psych evaluation (been there before) and I knew I wasn't a real danger to myself. next day at work I went to the walk in clinic at lunch and spoke with a doctor, he was great, I told him my past history with RIs and how I felt like a zombie on them. He understood that but also reassured me that medication is necessary and we could try something else (Klonazepam and sertraline) have been feeling somewhat better the past couple days without suicidal thoughts but I am having the most intense anxiety/panic attacks that are lasting hours, it usually happens right when I wake up in the morning or after a nap. My good friend told me to put a cold pack on my chest and breathe in through my nose and out through my mouth like I'm blowing through a straw, it helps but only temporarily until the feeling floods my body again. I can hop on my computer and play games with my group of friends but my brain is so scattered that I can't even have conversations with them and have no desire to play games. sertraline helped yesterday when I was feeling like this but it's been about 2 hours since I took one this morning and I still feel fucked up (heart rate increased, trouble breathing, nausea etc...) I have barely been able to eat the past couple weeks, I get extremely hungry but as soon as I take one or two bites of good I feels nauseous and can't finish it. guess I'm just looking for advice from other people that have dealt with this, I've been thinking of taking a leave from work but my symptoms seem to be worse when I'm at home alone with my thoughts so I don't know if it would be a good idea. I know I need to switch jobs or look for something else because the industry I'm in is extremely toxic as an employee (automotive service advisor) yeah, if anyone has tips or has dealt with something similar please let me know what works for you, I've been feeling like this all morning and it's really taking a toll on me :(Help with Panic/Anxiety attacks",1635093818,2894,546

Anxiety,"Hey guys. I’m new to this page, but I’m really just looking for encouragement. I got a dog about 5 months ago with a friend. I thought it would be helpful, but it turns out my anxiety suffered more from having to think about another think to care for. I didn’t know this was going to be the way it worked out. I found her a good new home, but my friend is really mad about it. I explained how my anxiety was worse and I just couldn’t keep going. He was really mad because I committed to taking the dog, and I can understand that. The part that is hard is that he said I was trying to use my anxiety as a form of manipulation. One of my biggest fears is that people hear me talk about my mental health and just see it as me trying to make excuses when in reality it’s a real experience that I’m having. I feel like a majority of my friends don’t understand my anxiety and it’s really hard sometimes. Feels lonely and isolating.

Anxiety,"Hello, this is my first post here, I am a 26 year old male, and I have never been diagnosed but I do want to see someone so I can figure out what it is that’s wrong with me and how I can fix so I can live a normal life. This post is just me trying to see if anyone else lives with the constant anxiety I feel, and if so some good tips on what I can do for myself. It’s nice to have a place to talk to people about how I feel because I feel like when I bring it up to most people they write it off as “everyone has anxiety” and I know that’s some what true but I also know that there’s no way this is normal and it took me years of being in denial to want to start looking for help. My wife suggested it because she has similar problems but now that she sees a therapist and is medicated she has a much better and happier day to day. me, I was always labeled a “worry wart” even as a child, this was true, I worried about grades like a crazy person, but I also have always worried about minor things like for example if I put something back and I didn’t tie that action into something to mentally mark that I did it I would walk back or turn around and drive back, doesn’t matter how far I am away, I have to go back and make sure. I even tried taking pictures to be able to show myself that I did complete whatever task it was. My mind is always in a constant state of what if’s. I have brief moments in between where I’m not thinking about anything but as soon as I snap back from being zoned out my anxiety comes right back. It’s like constantly playing the worst outcomes of every aspect of my life on a loop in my head. I have try to control my breathing to try to calm down, my heart feels like it’s always racing. I feel like I’m crazy and I just want to worry about things the appropriate amount and be able to actually enjoy my life. This makes it hard to spend time with friends and family and actually be present in the moment.

Anxiety,"I’ve had anxiety my entire life. The first panic attack I remember having was at four years old. In my teens, my doctors diagnosed me with something they called “catastrophic anxiety”. I don’t know if that’s a common term, but I came to learn it was pretty much worst case scenario for anxiety.   I started looking into everything that I can manage my condition. I’ve made radical changes to my diet, exercise, meditation routines, and lifestyle. And, it worked!  My anxiety is 95% better. I live a reasonably healthy, happy, and productive life, mostly free from anxiety.   question is, why don’t more of us take better care of ourselves? It seems like there are so many proven tools on the market, whether they are lifestyle, diet, or medical. But, many of us just sit around and complain, and don’t take the actions that would make our lives better.   is this?Why the fuck don’t we take better care of ourselves?",1635088908,915,159

Kinda like butterflies?  the last 2-3 weeks I’ve had to process a lot. However, it hasn’t been debilitating. My mind feels very quiet and I can catch myself going in rabbit holes of thinking and nip it. o I feel like mentally it isn’t the problem. But I still feel this tickling in my chest.  27f relatively healthy. I workout, have a support system, eat relative healthy. I do have hypothyroidism and acid reflux. I go to therapy and am able to process and cope. But, I can’t shake off this feeling in my chest even when my mind is relatively at peace.  ever experience this?

Anxiety,"I’ve suffered with anxiety all my life. Especially now in my 30s with major life changes. I’ve felt like anxiety has always latched into something whether it was making sure my food was cooked to safe levels so that I didn’t die or my bank account was at a certain amount so I didn’t feel I was going broke. There is so much perfectionism and control that I feel exhausted from it.  therapist has said that I should start taking a step back from the control but of course my anxiety makes me feel that taking a step back means losing control.  anxiety unfortunately reached an all time high when I started dating my amazing girlfriend. I went from really making sure that I was ready to get into a relationship with her to then checking and double checking if she really loved me to then checking to double checking if I really loved her when our honeymoon phase started to wear off. I felt like I put so much energy into just figuring out my anxiety and figuring us out, it took away from me really investing in us many attacks and events that have made me distant. he has still stayed by my side and I cannot trade that for the world. I want to move forward in our relationship but every big step is met with anxious intrusive thoughts to the point that I shut down not sure what more I can do. adly the intrusive thoughts can be so loud that sometimes I feel the solution is to leave the relationship. And I truly don’t want to do that.  am a little more clear now in my head as I write this. But I am so afraid of my triggers that I feel numb a lot more than often.

My sleep have rapidly declined( used to get 10 hours of sleep now I only get 3 or 6) sometimes I stay up for a night or 2, but I feel like my anxiety all started becuz of vaping nicotine (puff bars to be exact) which are fucking strong 50mg.

It’s almost gone by now but whenever I talk or move my head hurts a little. I got a scan of my brain done and nothing was wrong with is it. The doc probably said it was probably because my body and brain where still detoxing, from heavy use. Anyways my anxiety got bad that I couldn’t stay in one room doing classwork and I could not focus for shit. It’s like that for everything now my focus is so bad now, and my balance.

Anxiety,"I've moved 3 times in the last two years because of bugs. Before that, in college, I moved 4 times due to insects. My life used to be so well put together and I loved coming home after work to relax in my sanctuary. After all of these issues and researching, I feel like I know way too much about bugs to ever feel ""normal"" in a home again.  I can't even fathom the idea of moving into a new place without taking extreme precuations: only living on the 2nd floor or higher, no shrubbery along the foundation of the home, no apartment complexes, deep cleaning and vaccuming, caulking EVERYTHING with a crack/gap, glue traps, cimexa dust, ortho home defense, door sweeps, dehumidifier, etc, you get the idea. don't even know what is considered a normal amount of bugs in a home now. I know every home has some, but I find myself constantly checking with a flashlight around baseboards and cabinets and monitoring with glue traps. Any time I see something that's not a fly or spider, my anxiety is triggered and I can't eat or sleep. matter how many precautions I take, it seems like there's always an issue. First it was german roaches in a student apartment, then springtails and crickets in a townhome, silverfish in another townhome, then millipedes/ants/wolf spiders in a new build home, then grain weevils and ants in a 2nd floor condo, and now carpet beetle larvae in a two floor townhome I'm currently in. soon moving into a 4th floor condo in the nicest/cleanest luxury building I've ever lived in. It's a 2b/2ba with laminate floors and the lady/landlord is as OCD clean as I am, which is great. Absolutely no clutter, baseboards are sealed, the place is spotless. The HOA keeps the entire building and amenities spotless. I toured yesterday and spent an hr on hands and knees with a flashlight inspecting every inch of the place and only found 1 dead spider. I'm hoping this place will be better for me, and I'm okay with a few bugs every now and then, but not an infestation like the previous places.  only ever rent and have downsized my entire life in case I need to quickly move and that gives me some comfort. I'm wondering if the glue traps are making my anxiety worse. Would I even notice these things if they weren't caught in the traps? But at the same time, not knowing if an infestation is growing under my nose gives me anxiety too. am in therapy for the anxiety but it just feels terrible knowing that my whole life is affected by something so illogical and small as insects.

The past month or so (since we lost our dog) I have been feeling minorly-severely nauseous, dizzy, and very spacey at times throughout the day. I originally thought it was because of a vitamin I started taking, or maybe a weird bug I had, as it continued I started worrying it might be something more. Nope, today I realized it is all anxiety. It is the exact same reaction I used to get when eating out the first few times after we were vaccinated and back then I knew it was anxiety. It now just plagues me every day. Guess it is time to start looking for a therapist again. In a weird way it’s nice to at least know this isn’t some major medical issue behind this. Man I miss the days when my anxiety was just a numb spot on my back. What are some “creative” ways your anxiety manifests itself into your physical being? 🤦‍♀️Last night I realized all the weird physical symptoms i’ve been plagued with lately are all my anxiety!

Anxiety,"Hello everyone I'm 18 years old and whenever I lie down to my bed, or get up and stand still, I feel my heart beating hard, but not specifically fast. I lie down I can hear my heart beating and its really annoying that makes me feel uncomfortable. I was born with a biscupid heart valve, but I get checked yearly and they haven't found a problem yet. also had a checkup 2 weeks ago with my cardiologist who told me my heart is fine(he did an ekg and echo), but I have some arrythmias(both brachycardia and tachycardia) . I also have chest pains which are sharp and last for a few seconds.My blood pressure usually varies from 13/7 to 11.5/6.5 it usually is around 12/7 at rest doctor I've asked about my chest pain, blames anxiety. I also have had my thyroid checked and had some full blood tests which were all were clear. chest pains and the heart beating hard but not fast are driving me crazy. Could the arrythmias cause this? everytime I lie down and try to sleep I think I might die or something. But every other time of the day, like when I'm walking, sitting on a chair studying etc I don't feel these discomfort I'm also going to get a 48hour Holter monitor In a week or so. But I really feel I had have to ask. other health conditions. I'm pretty health and have a Good diet, I don't smoke nor drink. Nor previous incidents of heart disease in my family...Could anxiety cause this kind of palpitations?",1635075629,1412,265
Anxiety,"I’m aware that some doctors only care about money. I missed my appointment with my psychiatrist. My fault. I asked him for his next available schedule. He said it would be next week.

I just texted him that I’m improving and that the meds are effective.  sent my payment and he sent the prescriptions. He increased my dosage from 1mg of clonazepam every night to 2mg. Not sure if he did that purposely to thank me for my payment without him doing any work or he just really doesn’t care about how addicting benzos are. I’m not stupid to take 2mg of clonazepam every night. I’m okay with 1mg, even .5mg is enough to make me functional and feel less anxious. ome doctors are… stupid.Doctor increased the dosage of clonazepam",1635075366,910,163
Anxiety,My boyfriend and I  are in a long distance relationship for a year already and like how it is for most LDR is that we only rely on calls and chats only. There are times that he'll be giving me late replies or will not have my message seen even I am seeing his shared posts on Facebook. I have anxiety and updates are so important to me. It makes me feel anxious and sad all the time. I sometimes feel bad about it but I always tell myself that he is an individual that needs space and a time for himself too. I already told him about that one time. I don't know if I am just being irrational. I feel sad about it.What should I tell myself?,1635075340,639,129
Anxiety,"Right now I’m sitting and worrying, as usual, about work tomorrow, when I should be enjoying my day off. I will have to be on shift with several people I don’t like, who don’t like me, plus having to deal with erratic and rude customers (I work in a grocery store), when I just wish I could be left alone. I left school not long ago, I’m 18, and I had a really difficult time there too, feeling like my stomach was gonna fall out of my ass most of the time, weird way to describe it but it’s one of the worst emotional feelings I experience, plus just being on the edge of tears all the time. It’s the same in work, except this time it’s people twice my age giving me shit, some things never change I guess. Yesterday was an awful shift, I won’t go into the dynamics of my job and how I’m treated, but it’s just hell. As soon as I arrived, my neck broke into red hives as I was so nervous, my thoughts just run wild with all that’s going to go wrong. Then at the end of the night, my mind going over and over all the nasty things that were said to me and what the next shift will be like, I just want to shut off. I would say my anxiety is all social, stemming from a rocky childhood with my family, and really bad experiences in school. I can never seem to escape it, as this being my first job, is no different concerning people that make you feel like dirt on their shoe. It gets to the point where I really hate people, I just want to do my job in peace, like how I wanted to go to school in peace, I don’t understand why some people just see you as an open season target when all you’re trying to do is mind your own business. I don’t mind my work in itself, it keeps my mind distracted and it gives you purpose, even if the customers are rude it’s not personal, they don’t know you, you serve them and then you move on, but when you work with others that are just relentless in their crappy ways, and you can’t even think of a reason for them to be that way other than the plain fact they’re just not nice people, it really does mess with you. I’m going to look for a new job soon, but then it’s the thoughts like ‘what if the people there are worse’ that make me reconsider. ometimes I think, is it me that’s the problem, or do I just seem to be extremely unlucky encountering horrible people wherever I am. easy to say I want to separate my work life from my personal life, but when you spend the majority of your free time worrying about when you’re next working and checking the Rota reminding yourself of all the people you’ll be working alongside, it becomes more than work, it becomes like your own personal nightmare. Worry, worry, worry, until I feel like I want to puke, and I’ve been up most of the night tossing and turning, that I’ve gotten myself into such a state I don’t want to leave my bed. ometimes it’s not as bad as I imagined, sometimes its worse, sometimes my anxious ways will calm and I find I can approach my problems better, but then it’ll hit me full force and I’m like a piece of fluttering jelly again. As the days go by, I find myself wanting to avoid all of human kind just so I’m not haunted by this issue, I go out of my way to stay below the radar, I don’t have friends, I stay away from family as much as possible, I set myself a goal most days to avoid interacting with others as much as I can, in the case something happens that’ll make me over think for days on end afterwards. I hate getting messages, I hate getting calls, I feel so lonely sometimes but I also just want to be left completely alone. You can never be satisfied when you feel so indifferent. I love people but I also despise them, having a good social interaction can make you feel amazing, truly make your day, but a bad one can break you into pieces, so in the event that happens, I just want to avoid everything and everyone. I feel so fucked up.Hating my job is making the anxiety I feel just unbearable most days",1635075014,3929,770

Anxiety,"I love fall and winter, but it does have its cons. I live about 3 miles from the bay, and when the air is humid sounds from the water can sound like they're right next to my house. Boat foghorns, sea lions barking(especially when its echoey) and general sounds from the shipyard are very triggering for my anxiety at night.

Anxiety,o. In 2020 I experienced sooo many headaches. Very stressful year. It started in June 2020 and I would have a headache like 3-4 times a week for months. Up until around April 2021. My headaches reduced. From April 2021- eptember 2021 I had experienced probably 5 really bad headaches. But now October. I experienced 4 so far. 2 this week. And it lasts a whole day. I’m just sad because headaches really ruin my quality of day.  It makes me feel unbalanced and I lose my appetite. I also feel like imma fall down or something. I’m scared. I’m sure it’s stress induced. I’ve been doing alot of breathing exercises and trying to worry less but It won’t help. I just don’t know what to do. I hate headaches.

Anxiety,"I have really bad friendship anxiety, to the point where even if someone replies to a message in a slightly different way I'm worried something is wrong. I'm aware it's a 'me' problem rather than them. However, over the last few days my best friend has been different and I need someone to convince me I'm not over thinking it 😅We speak daily, most of the time from morning until the evening but the last few days she has been busy, which is fair enough, so there's been a few occasions recently where I've only heard from her 2/3 times a day (again, fair enough shes been busy). The thing that is worrying me is over the last few weeks it seems like she has been avoiding seeing me. Just to give you some context, she's 25 and is married, I really get along with her husband although him and I did have a disagreement and didn't get along about 3 years ago, but that has since been sorted. The other day I mentioned dropping something off to her house and she said she would come and pick it up from me (which made less sense as I was driving past her house at the time and I live a 25 minute drive from her). I also suggested going shopping with her one weekend and she agreed to going but said it's easier if we do it in the week during our lunch breaks at work and then this weekend I asked if her and her husband wanted to go for lunch and she said they were busy (which is fine) and then yesterday she tells me they're going for  lunch this afternoon.Now I've written this all down it seems trivial but something in my head is just telling me something is up. It almost seems like she doesn't want me seeing her husband? And now I'm worried he has an issue again. This is where my anxiety kicks in as I've not done anything for him to dislike me I just seem to over think things too much and come up with silly scenarios. Please tell me other people feel like this sometimes?Help please",1635071890,1892,365
Anxiety,"This woman and I have been talking on a semi-regular basis since early 2020 (i.e. the beginning of the pandemic). We generally get along *really* well, but over the past few months, things have become a bit awkward between us. I think this is partly because I've developed pretty strong feelings for her, but I've also been dealing with a lot of anxiety and inner turmoil throughout this period—and, from what I gather, so has she. what happened between us?  I came on a bit too strong. I wouldn't say that I *blew up* her inbox per se, but I did try to engage her in conversation with some regularity—mostly by responding to her stories on IG—and I misjudged the closeness of our relationship (she had confided in me about something personal, which I took to mean that we'd forged a stronger bond). he requested, in the nicest way possible, that I try to keep her boundaries in mind when engaging her, at which point I acknowledged that I got the sense that she may have needed some space, apologized, and pledged to do better going forward. About a month later, I sent a couple strongly-worded messages where I pointed out that it seemed as if she'd been feeling down lately while emphasizing the fact that I care about her. In response, she again had to reinforce a boundary, for which I apologized and re-evaluated my approach with her.  all good, right?  the very next day, I was half-asleep and absent-mindedly sent her *yet another* strongly-worded message. In response, she basically face-palmed harder than Jean-Luc Picard in a room full of Qs. I was incredibly embarrassed and shut down the conversation; I later played it off like I was being ""passive-aggressive"" and ""trolling"". The day after, I messaged her once more to say that I felt ""like a jackass"". And I subsequently vanished for a week. next time I said anything to her was on an IG post, where I complimented an outfit she was wearing. My thinking was that, if she responded, then all is well; she did not, despite replying to almost everybody else, so I sent a very brief *actual* apology via DM and left it at that. It remains on ""sent"" as opposed to read. ince then, I've mostly maintained radio silence, a situation that has not changed since the start of the month. The only two exceptions were comments I made on her YouTube community tab in response to a couple of posts she added over the past week or so. Within a couple minutes of saving said comments, they disappeared from view. Initially I assumed that she had deleted them herself, but they were still visible when I sorted by ""newest first"", so my guess is that they were automatically filtered out and held for review. I wound up deleting both comments within 10 minutes of adding them, hopefully before she noticed either.  here's the thing. I suffer from psychiatric conditions that make me ***extremely*** sensitive to rejection, real or perceived. Even the slightest change in someone's energy towards me can set off alarm bells in my head, telling me that so-and-so doesn't want to be friends anymore. ometimes it isn't even triggered by signals that *they* were giving off—I could have a premonition out of literally nowhere that tells me I'm about to be ghosted. (One time it literally came from a dream.) At that point, I become desperate to salvage things, or to get some kind of reassurance that it's all in my head. And it should come as no surprise that this desperation is amplified by orders of magnitude when I harbor feelings for somebody. (i.e. teen years), when I went through these phases, my approach was aggressive and confrontational—very quick to make assumptions and cast aspersions. I accused people of purposefully ignoring me, projected my own insecurities onto them, that sort of thing. As an adult, I've been a lot more passive in my attempts at receiving positive feedback so as to reaffirm our continued friendship. I send messages of love and support as a way of showing my potential value to their lives, in the hopes that they will decide against abandoning me. it even need to be said that this tendency of mine has sabotaged many relationships over the years? good news is that I have gotten *much* better about effectively managing my emotions, disengaging from situations where my anxiety can wind up clouding my judgment, and coming back only when I can have a mature conversation about how I feel. However, it remains a regular struggle. Over the past few months, I've been feeling really down. I'm unusually lethargic—spending a lot of time lying in bed, neglecting household chores, and barely even mustering the energy to go outside for any reason. I've been detached from friends and family these days. And on top of everything else, my anxiety has skyrocketed into the stratosphere. I'm trying to keep myself away from social media until such time that I can sort my feelings out. want to be clear that I don't believe any of this is an *excuse* for inappropriate behavior. I still have to work at managing my emotions, and I can't just use ""anxiety"" as a get-out-of-jail-free card whenever I do anything wrong (as an aside, I'm pretty sure that she also struggles with severe anxiety, and I suspect I've triggered it on a few occasions). But I do feel like, if she knew some of this—not necessarily the specifics, just the general gist of things—it might help to give her some insight into why I've been acting this way. what should I do? Is it a good idea to open up about this to her? It's been really bothering me, and I'm worried that I've permanently ruined everything between us. What should I do?I (male, late 20s) had a bit of a falling-out with an internet friend (female, early 30s) about a month ago, and I would really like to give her some context for my behavior, but I don't know if it's a good idea.",1635071713,5799,1020

Anxiety,"It's lead me (combined with depression and some others) to avoid things, and do other unhealthy things instead, which culminated in my life progressively getting worse and eventually falling apart in one way after another for 2 decades now, leaving not much left on the table except a life full of regrets or suicide, and a trail of people I've disappointed or hurt, which just pushes me closer to the edgeAnxiety has destroyed my life, thanks brain!",1635063272,450,77

And then I think about it and think about it and my friends worry about me the entire day because I won’t talk about it. And then when I actually do go to talk I choke on my words. I have this constant buzzing in my head telling me I’m not good enough or something is wrong or don’t put your weight on other people’s shoulders. It’s annoying because I live in constant thought.

I suggested therapy but she said that their family is having a really hard time financially right now since they just moved too. Also to add on shes suffered with eating problems a lot, I have always been worried that she has eating disorders and pukes out a lot of her food but she always dismisses my concerns stating that it's not a big deal.

Anxiety,"I'm late 30s and recently have been suffering from some pretty crippling anxiety. Never had any issues with it my entire life and there are no triggers that would have caused it.Every account I can find features either someone who suffered a triggering event or is someone who's suffered from it from some degree most or all of their life. I can't find any accounts of someone well into their life that suddenly began dealing with major episodes of anxiety with seemingly no reason for the onset.  wondering if anyone else has dealt with something similar. Not sure what I'm going to do with that information, but I guess maybe it'll help ease my mind in knowing I'm not alone if nothing else. And before you ask, I have a wonderful family, no recent losses, financially stable, I love my job, drug free, I love my life. The MHC I saw couldn't find any common trigger that could've caused it. The only thing she could come up with was a really traumatic hurricane experience I survived, but that was 3 years ago.

Anxiety,"Hi all. I'm 28 and have been suffering from generalized anxiety and social anxiety for the majority of my adult life. I've tried everything under the sun minus pharmaceuticals. I've seen friends struggle with the same disorders and go the pharmaceutical route; it seems like, while they may help a little, they're not long-term strategies. question is this. For those who've suffered from these disorders for much of their lives as well, what have you done to conquer your anxiety?

He also knows my mom is immunocompromised and I live with her.  is how I feel safe and comfortable, I don’t think it should be a problem for him.

Anxiety,"o on Monday I was prescribed gabapentin for my anxiety/on edge/panic attacks. he prescribed me the lowest dose, 100mg 2x a day. After the first ever pill I noticed the peak high within a hour. It was nice. Wasn’t too much but made me feel relaxed. It kind of felt like a couple hits of weed but without feeling all the extra psychoactive effects or kind of like a low dose of Xanax. It overall got rid of my on edge which is crucial because I get that all day everyday. Took the second pill later that night but I didn’t feel anything. Later that night I had another episode of just really bad anxiety so maybe that’s why I didn’t feel it. day same routine, felt the nice buzz and I do feel the calming effects last for about 6 hours which is when I take my second one. I feel much better than last week. I get anxiety from my heart because I always feel it pound when I get up/sit down. I get heart palpitations and surges of adrenaline and this is suppressing all that. I feel normal. I am curious about is why I’m reacting good to such a low dose. People on here told me that 100mg is nothing and usually won’t feel anything until you’re on 300mg. I realize I’m building a tolerance but I feel like it’s helping me. With that being said if I’m having a panic attack this dose will do nothing for me. what you all have to say.

Anxiety,"10 years ago I was diagnosed with PTD, general anxiety and a slew of other things. Had a pretty good handle on them within 3 years. Was coping really well not in therapy or on meds. The past 10 months my husband and I faced 4 very significant traumas of severe medical issues with an immediate family member that needed our care for 4 months followed by loss of twin babies, and just recently the death of our sweet puppy due to unpreventable medical issues. All of that on top of a global pandemic and me being an elementary teacher who has been teaching in person since before vaccines were even in the table last year, while also teaching virtually, and dealing with basically an entire shift in how my career works. The past month or so (since we lost our dog) I have been feeling minorly-severely nauseous, dizzy, and very spacey at times throughout the day. I originally thought it was because of a vitamin I started taking, or maybe a weird bug I had, as it continued I started worrying it might be something more. Nope, today I realized it is all anxiety. It is the exact same reaction I used to get when eating out the first few times after we were vaccinated and back then I knew it was anxiety. It now just plagues me every day. Guess it is time to start looking for a therapist again. In a weird way it’s nice to at least know this isn’t some major medical issue behind this.

Anxiety,"I’ve had anxiety my whole life. Despite that, I did my best and I’ve worked hard to be an A student. Because I spent most of my school life this way, I didn’t realize just how high expectations I’ve forced on myself. I always feel like I must be perfect, that I must always get higher than a B in all my classes. Recently however, this sort of thinking messed me up big time. the past few months, I’ve been going through financial difficulties. My depression has made a comeback. I’ve begun struggling at school. I had a car accident last week and it was extremely traumatizing. And in my recent exams, I had two panic attacks back to back for the first time in my life. I had a nervous breakdown after I came home. can’t stop thinking about the worst things. Ever since some exams became online, I’m filled with an irrational fear of being accused of academic misconduct. I’m an honours student that always had high marks so thinking about this makes me feel like my life is ending. What if I do get accused? What if it ends on my transcript? What if I get kicked out of college, never get a degree and never be able to get the job that I’m pursuing ever again? I can’t breathe. Everyone is telling me it’s irrational and I know it is. But I can’t make a part of myself believe it. Next thing I know, I’ve started thinking that my whole education was worthless, that nothing was worth it and all the time I spent getting As is going down the drain IF something like that happens. I keep telling myself that I’ve started to struggle anyways, that I’ve already started failing. family is telling me that I shouldn’t think of the worst outcome. That I should be strong. But I’m not strong. I’m so brittle and I feel like I’ll break the moment wind blows in my direction.  I hate feeling this way, I don’t want to feel this way but I can’t control myself. so hard. My anxiety has never gotten this bad before. I can’t stop myself from thinking that the worst will happen. They say “It’s a very very very small possibility” but for me, as long as the possibility is there, it could happen, so I’m going to keep making myself suffer by thinking about it.  can’t breathe, I can’t sleep, I can’t eat, I’ve lost 4 pounds in 3 days. I feel like I’m going to have a heart attack any second. I can’t enjoy anything anymore. I truly don’t know what to do.

Anxiety,"In another post, which got practically no response.I was trying to ask about becoming so tense theirs almost a robot taking over the room or you feel so not belonging, you overcompensate. past history with special education, divorce in family, and bullies. REALLY destroyed me. I noticed I accidentally can become a complete asshole in distrust or fear someone is doing something to hurt me or otherwise. I also feel so slow, and have a high pitch voice and am in my 30s. I do weird stuff in my fears and have developed weird belief systems I'm finally starting to embrace I do. try to just relax and people have told me at my past job.They acted like I had some sort of split personality and made jokes behind my back. A mixture of my high pitched voice and soft spoken nature when I'm relaxed versus a busy high stress shift we're I'm agitated. I do have feelings of inferiority and always think I need some cure to be completely normal. (I'll never be like you in this way, you have me beat) Although, I noticed this too. I start to realize and ask whether a socially avoidant personality disorder can sometimes overcompensate and not seem like an avoidant. I noticed in psyche tests (speaking so fast ppl can barely understand you).  socially avoidants seen as mean people instead of nice often? ocially avoidant sounded a bit like a ""feeling of inferiority"" and type of personality that might in fact be kind.But maybe this personality can have a dark side?I'm an infj and I notice I'm overboard and can be totally perfectionistic. Maybe I'm seen as a jerk?! Can I be like that but still be avoidant? And if I am, how do I tone it down?Feeling out of place and trying too hard. Can I be socially avoidant and yet seem robotic?",1635044446,1731,313
Anxiety,"TW self harm, body dysmorphia, starvation, sleep paralysis, sickness/overall health, doctors, blood/blood work new to the whole trigger warning thing, so sorry if I end up putting stuff up that shouldn’t be, I’m sort of winging everything as I go. gonna be long, I’ve tried twice to make it short but it’s hard getting everything in without paragraphs, so sorry. of august I started feeling weird, stabbing pains all over, constantly thirsty, always tired. I took my temp and it was normal, so it started to worry me a bit; but I tried waiting it out. It didn’t work, so I finally told my mom, and she took me to the doctors. I remember the waiting room being so cold, but everyone was fine. We finally got called up and my heart started practically beating out of my chest. They took my temp, my weight, tested my blood sugar, took a Covid test, and took blood to test for mono and lyme. The guy sat there and practically drained my whole body. It was probably 30 seconds, but those seconds felt like minutes, and I could feel my arm start feeling funny. Got through it fine, felt fine, but I got up and all of a sudden, my ears started ringing LOUD, and I got really bad tunnel vision. I couldn’t even think vividly. Through the ringing I could just barely hear the doctor ask if I was ok, and he told me to sit; so I did. He came back with goldfish and the coldest water he could, and I remember barely being able to open the goldfish. It took me maybe 5-6 tries, I was so weak. Finished my water as quick as I could, everything cleared up so we headed home. Tests came back the next day, everything was perfect, yet I still didn’t feel it. Couple days past and it generally cleared up, but the anxiety still lingered, although less severe. Days passed and I started noticing the stabbing pains come back, and slowly I started realizing other things that were always there, a few to name are; constipation, feeling cold, troubles staying asleep, and literal troubles focusing, as in my eyes would randomly lose focus. o I brought it up with my mom, and she agreed to bring me again. But this time, with all these new symptoms I found it hard to explain it all; out of them all The only one I could bring myself to mention was the sleep, which is the one thing I care about the most. After getting home with a pound of papers explaining fatigue, I texted my mom telling her my issue, and she agreed to bring me to a different place tomorrow; but to make sure I told them everything. o I made a list, and we did just that. This time, once I handed the doctor my list, I had no issues at all explaining everything. He talked me through what could be going on, what they were, and how we could go about it. The things he mentioned that I remember are hypothyroidism and rheumatoid, which scared the shit out of me. He took blood and urine, and sent me on my way. Results came back 2 weeks later, majority was fine, and the things that weren’t were not to worry about, and he explained why. I just want to say; for such little amount of blood, I was surprised he could get 4 pages worth of tests out. Took way less than the other office and I didn’t almost collapse from it that time.He prescribed me 3mg melatonin, and we headed home. I sat in the car flipping through the pages, and just kind of felt shitty; I felt like I’ve convinced myself that I’m not fine, and manipulated my family into doing all this. till, the anxiety lingered, and even though that was all at the start of this month, I still don’t feel completely fine. I’m still constantly anxious, and I’d have more to type about but I’ve already gone on for so long I forgot how everything happened after that. But the one thing I can remember, recently, I’ve been noticing how much weight I’ve been losing, since they took my weight at all 3 visits. In pounds, maybe a month before my first visit I weighed 140, then the first visit I weighed 134, 2nd was 124, 3rd was 124. I weighed myself this morning and I weigh 122.5. o I mentioned this to someone I’ve been talking to about my mental health, and they said That wasn’t ok, and I needed to start eating more. I was always fat as a kid, and seeing the fact I weighed 124 made me happy, but I still feel… fat. I still think I am fat, I still have quite a bit of fat on my lower belly, around my waist and legs, and I’m not sure how to explain but I still struggle a bit with exercise. o being told repeatedly that I need to gain weight, after trying my heart out exercising and starving myself, pissed me off. It pissed me off BAD. I wouldn’t even say pissed, I was raging; steam coming out of my ears mad. I’ve tried my whole life to be the best person I could after I was such a horrible child, so being that mad kind of scared me, and made me depressed. I had these 3 emotions running through my head, right before bed. o I was angry, scared, sad, and tired. I couldn’t get to bed, I was up til probably 2am. The entire time, I tried thinking of ways to calm down, and ultimately the best decision was to well… cut myself. I never did, but it seemed like the only option. And that scared me even more. I started bawling my eyes out, I wanted to so bad, but I was scared it wouldn’t heal fast (I usually heal slower than normal, I don’t care for my wounds very well), and scared people would see. I finally ended up falling asleep, but sleeping with those emotions running through my head fucked up my dreams. One of my reoccurring nightmares came back after months of not having any at all, and sleep paralysis followed with it. One of the nightmares I always had was sleep inception, where I’d wake up in the dream and feel like I’ve woken up, I’ll be physically conscious and think to myself, just to be quickly scared by something then genuinely wake up. But this time, I can’t even count how many times I woke up in the dream, and it felt like I was awake and dreaming. I kind of remember seeing my closet and my wall but dreaming at the same time, I also felt like I was hanging off my bed. It was so weird, but my entire upper body was numb until I snapped out of it. That happened 4 days ago, and even after all that, the sickness, the multiple doctor visits, all the tests, I just feel like I’ve been lying to everyone, including myself. I don’t know what to do, everyone urges me to get help, but I feel like I made it all up, and it’s hard getting in touch with a professional who could help, and even then I feel like I don’t want help, I feel like these thoughts comfort me… which sucks, because I know I’d be better if I got help, but I just can’t. I can feel my depression coming back because of all of this, and I’m starting to notice signs of BPD like I did those years ago when I was genuinely depressed. I’m lost in my own body, unable to console myself, unable to trust my own thoughts.Feeling like I’ve been faking everything.",1635044254,6865,1314
Anxiety,"Warning - Triggers for pet death, mental health issues, toxic relationships, death, bullying, and trauma. all, first post on a new account. I've been having a rough time for quite awhile now with catastrophizing, but due to events from my past and even now, I feel like it's rational for me to think this way, and it's hindering my progress. Kinda long but please hear me out. goes like this - a large amount of the time, when things are going good for me, something bad happens and I end up losing that good thing, and it's draining slash related to my catastrophizing. some of the biggest examples: once went to a fair when I was 12 and had a great time, only for my parents to have a massive argument on the ride home and have my mother make my father get out of the car fifteen minutes away so he could walk the rest of the way (she did go back for him). 8 I got my first rabbit and I adored him, only for him to die the next day all of a sudden (rabbit I got after him I cherished like you would a dog or cat, only for him to randomly pass away from heatstroke one day when I went out to bring him in). ounds dumb, but I get VERY attached to my pets. 14 I went to a Catholic school that seemed really cool and great, only to end up being severely bullied and discriminated on for not being a Catholic (mother went there as a kid when she used to be Catholic) and developed severe panic attacks and massive depression, and lost all my friends from there and a boy I had a major crush on. At 15 had a crush on a boy that got close to a relationship before he came out as gay and said he only saw me as a good friend. told by family that ""some boy is going to ask you to Prom, just wait, he'll come out and ask you, he's just shy"". Never got asked, went with friends and sat alone during the couples slow dance. Guy I wanted to ask (we bonded after being a mini play) turned out to believe that all women liked to be abused as a secret fetish (a la Fifty hades of Grey), so I never asked him since I was disgusted. into a nursing program at 18, ready, willing, excited, and oh so ready to do well. After a month of sleepless nights over tests 2-3 times a week, and being bullied and harassed by my classmates and teacher for being the youngest and not having any experience. I dropped out after having four panic attacks in one day and exploding on my teacher. The week before a guy I had known for two weeks and was getting along well with admitted to me he needed to get married in a year or be deported back to Asia, so I cut off ties with him. a guy who became my first partner, and felt like things were going well bc we got along so well. ix months into our relationship, I found out that he had been cheating on me for 3 months with an obese woman (no insult intended) and had a fat fetish (he also had hypersexuality due to an event that happened with a girl he had a one night stand with that left him with trauma). I was also diagnosed with Autism; I was 18 and a half. another guy who became my second partner and at first we was everything I had ever wanted; he even wanted to get married and have two kids in the next few years. I felt happier then I had ever been and had ZERO anxiety about ANYTHING for the ONLY time in my life. Then his father died due to chronic alcoholism that destroyed his organs, and my partner slowly but became a depressed, angry, bitter person who refused therapy and meds (due to his strong Catholicism and a controlling mother) who blamed me for all the bad things in his life and became mentally abusive; never physical, but he verbally let out all his anger on me daily for hours on end. He also said that because I have AD I can't feel emotions and don't understand love. He also started drinking and by the time we broke up was only happy when he was drunk. He died in March from sudden heart failure at the age of 21. paternal grandfather, a flawed but profoundly awesome person, was diagnosed with thyroid cancer in the spring of 2017, and though it was a rough journey, I had faith he would make it because lots of cancer patients do these days, and my family prayed hard and long for him (I'm a Deist Christian who is not a big fan of prayer, but I thought positively and read articles and stats to reassure myself he would live). He was also a man of deep, pure faith. Then a few days after his birthday, his lungs started to fill up with so much fluid that he could not breathe and ended up in the ER. My entire extended family, even multiple nurses and doctors, prayed for him. Last words I said to him via FaceTime were ""there is always hope, I believe you'll be ok."" He never came out of that ER; he died three days before Thanksgiving at the age of 73. It was found out that Covid is what caused the fluid in his lungs and ultimately killed him, since the cancer was so small and pretty much in remission at that point. I was 19. Nearly a year later, my paternal grandmother still has severe depression. summer I had a part time job at a daycare for kids with severe autism and I cried with happiness when I got it; when I eventually found out that the kids were being abused (held down and pinned to the floor, things like that) and spoke out about it, the principal fired me. got a part-time job at Dunkin, where, after disclosing my autism since it does affect me in how I do a few things (like needing to be spoken to in a more formal manner to get things sometimes for example), I was bullied by my boss, who said things like ""I don't know why she can't be like the other girls"" RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME AND CUTOMER and left when my coworkers called me 'a freak' and 'a huge weirdo' while I was a foot away from them. I went out of my way to do tasks nobody else would do out of laziness and make sure my drinks were stellar. I went through two weeks of training at McDonalds, and I LOVED IT - I got to work with two friends from high school (both a year younger then me), I met nice people, and I found it FUN! Today, my manager, when I called to get my first real schedule, told me that I 'act differently from my coworkers' (aka I am not as social and 'talk 24/7. I work to work, and once everyone meets me, they know right away I am not neurotypical. EVERYONE) and he's not sure if I am 'a person he wants to represent his restaurant.' I went out of my way to be as social as I can be and kind to everyone and make my coworkers and customers smile, and I have never done any actions to upset anyone. I am 20. honest to the Good Lord am not fishing for any pity or trying to be all 'boo hoo poor me and my first world problems.' (sorry if that was rude); I don't believe in sympathy baiting, it's wrong. It just feels when I try to think positive or I AM positive and carefree, lots of the time it just ends up exploding like a grenade in my face. Like Mumford &amp; ons said - your grace is wasted in your face, your courage stands alone among the wreck. My current partner and therapist both understand and they mean so well, but I can't just 'think positive'. my partner's dad has a mild case of Covid, partner is fine, and his father is pretty healthy and is double vaxxed, but I keep thinking he'll die and then my current partner will do what my second did, end up a depressed and angry asshole who hates me, or that he might suddenly end up dying from Covid too. do you do when you don't want to catastrophize, but when so many times you have, your worst fear came true?Need Advice - Catastrophizing and I Can't Stop Thinking It's Rational",1635044156,7509,1474

Anxiety,"I guess this post is less for advice and more for inspiration. story long, I've always worked in the IT field, starting at a call center, then end user support, and now system administrator. Looking back, IT work seemed to fit me well and despite being nervous about being around or talking to random people, the actual technical work I enjoyed quite a bit. As I climbed the ladder, so to speak, the more ""project"" oriented my work got, and there was less end users to deal with. I thought this was a natural progression of IT work, but I'm finding there are multiple branches and I really picked the one that was terrible for me. potentially on-call 24/7 has me on edge all the time, and at my current job, I feel like I have to constantly perform to clear projects and move on to the next. uffice it to say, I'm not sleeping very well, and even on aturdays, I find myself having mini-panic attacks when I think about work. realize now I went down the wrong IT branch, but I really don't know what to do at this point. Google searches seem to suggest ""Tech Writer"" is a better fit for someone like me with anxiety, but without any formal training or certs, I don't see how I could get a position in that field, especially when I really have no idea if it'll even fit me better. this point, I'm willing to take a substantial salary hit (20-30k) if it means I can work at a job that doesn't stress me out as much as I'm stressed and anxious now. It would help me if anyone has any advice for someone in my position, or in the absence of advice, maybe a word of inspiration that you were in my spot and found your way out.

Anxiety,"I recently had a meeting with a therapist through a program that my health insurance just started offering. I never thought I had true anxiety, and always just felt I was a ""worrier"" and kind of ocd, but it seems to be getting worse. Well, based on the intake questions and with speaking with the therapist she said I have moderate generalized anxiety disorder. It wasn't until she started asking questions and talking about the physical symptoms that I was like Holy hell, it all kind of makes sense now. The dry mouth, heart rate, muscle aches, fatigue, shaky hands, stomach issues, heartburn. It's crazy. I have had so many medical procedures to try and figure out what is wrong with me, since I haven't felt normal in a long time. For them always to come back and say that nothing was wrong.

Anxiety,"i have a constant problem that is hard to describe even saying this is a problem is far from the truth. however, it’s the best way that i find i can pinpoint why i find this hard to deal with. when i am sober the world around me looks different. i mean how i actually see things through my eyes. it’s hard to say exactly how it is different. however, when i am sober my mind disassociates a lot, although when i am not in a dissociative state the world still looks different. i think the disassociation relates to it because when that is happening i feel a loss of connection from my soul to my body. it is a very uncomfortable feeling and i am learning to accept that and practice mindfulness in order to regain that connection. however, this leads me to think deeply about my eyes, and how my soul is seeing things through this human body, through its eyes, which (i think) leads me to see the world differently when i am sober. yes, it does occasionally happen when i am high ( marijuana) but i spent most of my teenage years (15-18) high every single day. being sober felt like a high because i was rarely ever sober. i was not a heavy drinker at that time. however, when i developed anxiety, i stopped smoking so often because it would trigger an attack.  anxiety is what led to my feelings of disassociation. so then i decided to drink more often after that began occurring. when i am drunk i rarely ever feel these emotions (anxiety, disassociating) i think it’s because the altering of my mind shifts my perspective to where i’m not constantly thinking about my body, mind, thoughts, or anything related to something that may trigger an uncomfortable emotion. of course i deal with sadness, anger, or happiness when i drink just as people do. however, i do not mind being sober. i do not constantly feel the need to drink or smoke in order to change the perspective. i have just been trying to understand why exactly it looks different. i perceive the world differently when sober. the world simply looks different trough my eyes when sober, no matter the feelings attached to the momenti have a problem that is hard to describe",1635035136,2136,390
Anxiety,"I've had severe GAD since I was 5 (lucky me developing so early) and it's only gotten more severe, I'm pretty sure it's gonna be a life long pattern and I'm only 16 now. I've tried and failed all that's been suggested to me. I've taken the drugs currently 150 mg of ertraline (Zoloft), I've picked up hobbies meant to be helpful, I've done therapy, and I've tried just ignoring it. Physically I'm that weirdo shaking, having panic attacks, and giving myself ulcers. Mentally it's always a struggle, my body and brain thrive on anxiety but that also takes a toll, I'm just always tired regardless of what I do.The thing I've been hating the most is despite my extensive vocabulary I can't find the words to properly articulate to my loved ones about how I'm feeling or what makes me struggle. I have some who continuously tell me that it's all made up in my head, it's a mental illness where else would it be? My Ass?! Anyway, back to rant and not just sarcasm.

Anxiety,"i have pretty bad anxiety about death. I’m very anxious about my health and anything that could kill me, i also have really bad social anxiety. Recently i’ve developed a fear of driving. Not driving myself (i can’t drive) but driving as a passenger.  i’m in a car it feels like i’m on the edge of dying and could crash at any moment. Whenever i get in a car it feels like i’m risking death. I can manage on small journeys with familiar roads, i feel very on edge the whole time but i can just deal with it. I hadn’t been on any long journeys since getting this fear but i went on one today and it was horrible.  whole drive i was extremely anxious and felt like i was about to die the whole. I went on holiday with my family and had a 2.5 journey, mostly on the motorway. I was very anxious leading up to it but it was either come on holiday or stay home alone for a week. I’m already anxious at night when not alone so being home alone would be awful. I decided to come and just deal with the car ride.  ended up panicking half way through because it was dark and we couldn’t see the road well and i thought i was about to die. I was in the car with my sister and my parents were in a separate car ahead. We pulled over and i didn’t want to drive any further with my sister. Her car is quite small and she’s a good driver but not as experienced as my parents and more anxious about driving so it felt less safe. My parents had to drive back to pick us up and one of them drove my sisters car and one drove the other. I was still very anxious the rest of the journey but i managed and we got there fine. has made me even more scared of driving, i don’t want to go in a car again any time soon. I’m terrified of driving back at the end of the week but i have no other options. I could potentially get the train back, there’d still be a 40 minute drive to the train station but it’d be a lot better than driving 2.5 hours. The problem is this would be like £20-40 which i don’t have and my parents probably wouldn’t want to pay for it. I’m getting some money soon so i could pay them back but i still don’t think they’d agree. Also getting a train alone would be difficult. I have social anxiety and never go out alone, i’d also be worried for safety reasons as i’m 17 and a girl. I could potentially get my sister to come with me but then it’d be even more expensive. I don’t think my parents will agree, i’d also feel stupid and pathetic asking and i don’t want to be annoying. It seems unnecessary and stupid but i really don’t want to drive back.  really don’t know what to do, i don’t want to get in a car again. I know it sounds dumb but to me getting in a car right now would feel like i’m risking my life. Driving just feels very dangerous and risky and i don’t want to do it.  I’m very trapped right now and i don’t know what to do.I’m on holiday with my parents and terrified of driving back",1635035067,2899,582

Anxiety," “I was yelled at” by my mother if I didn’t do the dishes on time is a huge understatement. I remember screams, spit flying out of her mouth because sehe was yelling so much. Telling me how I never do anything right or good enough. lamming cabinets and doors. Exaggerating the situation to my dad so he got angry at me to. today my roommate’s boyfriend was kind enough to offer to wash my pan that I was soaking (I hadn’t forgotten about it - I just was soaking the burnt parts off). He wasn’t angry at me - but the idea of him touching my pan and washing it for me (even though he offered) sent me into a state of anxiety. I did my best to hide it but I kept telling him “no no - I’ll do it. Just get another pan and I’ll clean that too. I’ll just clean the whole kitchen when you’re done - please don’t touch my pan”  they were both like “why it’s easier for me to just wash this one so that there’s not two dirty pans” — But I couldn’t let him clean it. - and there’s not room in the kitchen for me to wash and him to cook at the same time, so he relented and just got another pan. I feel awful for being so adamant but the genuine fear I feel when I even hear my roommates do the dishes is enough to make me truly anxious - much less someone washing my stuff. ma.Trying to explain to my roommates why I won’t let anyone but me wash my pans is...uncomfortable",1635032186,1362,275

Couple that with already having some simptoms, and I’m literally on the verge of insanity. My value was 41.95 (max should be 37). I repeated the test after a week and it was 20, so in range. I’ve had an MRI afterwards and a few ultrasounds which couldn’t find anything. But now of course that I’m thinking that I should also get a CT or a PET scan or an EU and my mental health just keeps getting worse. GIs told me that I’m too young for pancreatic (21 yrs old) and that Ca19-9 can be elevated in multiple other things, sometimes for no reason at all. But still, the fact that I’ve lost weight suddenly, fatigue, night sweats, back pain and I have yellow floating stools and my blood sugar is a bit elevated simply make me CONVINCED that I have it.

Anxiety,"I'm currently in my 4th week of my first job. Honestly a small bit proud that I got a job considering my anxiety mainly as well as depression kept me from getting one.But it has not been going too great, I cant help but to feel like I am super slow at the job and a major inconvenience to the managers. I feel like I'm using a bunch of nonexistent energy on this job so I feel like my performance just isnt that great. With that being said, i am trying what I believe is my best. Another issue is that I'm doing a very bad job at taking initiative when I need to and non-assertion has been an issue for me forever (such as speaking/asking questions/calling out for items).I currently work 4 days a week while doing college, this has been a lot (for me of course) and recently I was planning on asking my manager if I could reduce it to 3 days. But I feel like I have no right to do that. Especially since this morning I woke up with terrible anxiety and called in sick - something I'm really embarrassed about and I hope wont become a habit (which I'm sure it wont since needless to say my anxiety did not get a lot better and only felt worse since I missed work and now I'm worrying constantly about what they think of me). I feel like it looks really bad missing work in my first month. I already want to quit to be honest and I just feel all around embarrassed and super weak that I cant handle it. It also concerns me and makes me feel as though I'll never amount to getting or keeping a job especially since this is a food service/kitchen job so it's technically supposed to be pretty basic.I've just been filled with fear that they're going to fire me, and I've been filled with so much exhaustion and disappointment next to that.Now I'm not sure if I should just quit, or ask for the reduced work days, or just suck it up and keep going till they kick me out. my personal situation/experience , I honestly welcome any general advice to keeping a job while struggling mentally.How do you deal with having a job ?",1635029494,2018,387

Anxiety,"o a few nights ago I saw something on tv that I could only describe as almost like the max headroom incident. There was a alert warning sound that played, like when a severe weather alert plays. I went over to the tv to see what was going on. And it was just like a bunch of random pictures being shown. There was also a random persons voice in the back ground. I couldn’t make it out as I had the tv volume low for background noise while I was on my computer. o idk for sure what they were saying. I kinda just stood there for a minute baffled at what I was seeing lol.

I started to be hopeful that something would spark up and I think the worst thing I did, was be hopeful for a future with a guy. I imagined finally having someone to do things with (couple things)–and that made me hopeful. However, it fizzled out when he stop communicating as often. At this stage I figured it was because of lack of interest–which has really bummed me out during the last few weeks. I find it funny because I had t been sure of him, but my hopes got the best of me.  now a aturday evening and I’m home. No plans.

Being home alone makes me miss the guy (who I’d been unsure of and to do this day know I didn’t like him enough yet it bugs me).  feeling of having nothing to do, causes anxiety for me. When Friday comes and I have no plans, it makes me feel sad. ad that I lack a dating life. ad that I don’t have other friends with less complicated lives. ad that I may not have been social enough to make more friends.

Anxiety,"Hi. o I'm kind of concerned that I might have some sort of anxiety issue. I mean, I've never had a panic attack or any sort of symptom like that, but this stuff can't be normal. the first one isn't an issue right at this moment, because I'm away at school and don't have my car, but it was really bad over the past year. I've been driving for about 7 years but this only started within the last year. I had taken the year off of school due to COVID (my mom was concerned and it was gonna be my senior year so my parents didn't want me to spend it all online). o for the past year I was working my retail job that I usually did during holidays. It's like barely a 7 minute drive from my house if there's traffic. problem was that if I even took my eyes off the road for a second, just to look at the speed or in the rear view mirror, I would get extremely paranoid that I might have hit someone. No one was in the road, no bumps or anything but I'd still get nervous. Then I would look in the rear view mirror again to check, and get even more nervous about it. I wasn't having any breakdowns or anything, but I just couldn't let it go. o I would pull into the parking lot of a store that was like 2 minutes from my house, loop all the way back to my job, and then drive home again. All while scanning the road intently. It happened day or night. ometimes it would even happen on the way to work, and I would loop through my neighborhood and drive down my street again to make sure nothing happened. That one only happened like a few times.  I would say that when driving home from work it would happen like every other time. Not so much when I started working (like the beginning 2020) but it was like that by the end of this past summer before I came back to school. issue just has to do with apartment safety. Every day before I leave/before I go to bed, I have to make sure that my bedroom/living room lights are off, bathroom/kitchen sink are off, fridge is shut, stove is off, and door is locked. I have a lighter for some candles on the counter and every day before I leave I stare at it for like 30 seconds to make sure it doesn't burst into flames or some shit, and never put anything near it. The stove and the door is what's the worst though. I have to pull on the door several times to make sure (it's just a deadbolt). But I've been really bad with the stove. Making sure all of the burners/oven are off like at least 8 times. The other night I did it so many times and put my hand on all of the burners and in the oven twice to double check it was all off. big thing that made me want to post this happened the other week. I had gotten out of my last class and was heading towards the shuttle. On my way there, I accidentally stepped on the back of a girl's shoe when we were trying to walk around one another, and brushed against another girl's backpack when she was talking in the middle of the path. Both times, I looked back at them. But then halfway to the shuttle, I had to turn around and go all the way back to make sure nothing had happened. I don't even know what could have happened, but I couldn't stop thinking about it. Obviously, neither of them were there anymore, but my mind just kept going ""you have to check, you have to check."" I only caught the shuttle because it was running late, but when I turned around to go back and check, I thought it would end up making me have to wait for the next one (they're only like 20 minutes apart though). when I was biking I passed some people on the road and then went around a corner and was afraid that somehow I might have grazed them with my handlebars or something (I don't fucking know). o I braked and sat there on my phone for a minute until they came around the corner. that I'm typing this out, there's also this little tic (?) that I have. I only do it occasionally now, but I used to do it all the time in middle school and high school. Basically, with my pointer finger I run it over the nail on my thumb, then trace the outside of the nail all the way around. Then I do it to the rest of my fingers with my thumb. Then, I put my pointer finger in between itself and my thumb, then do the same with my thumb between each of the rest of my fingers. I do this with both hands at the same time, usually a few times in a row when I do it. orry if that isn't super understandable, but either way it's something I've been doing for years. I could take a video of it or something if someone needs to see it. When I hear about anxiety online it doesn't exactly sound like this but I wasn't really sure what else this would be. The only other thing I could think of was me being really paranoid. It's not like I'm have physical reactions to this stuff and it's only for certain things so it's not like, debilitating I don't think. I don't even know if I would need actual treatment or should just talk to a therapist. I guess I just wanted some other opinions before trying to bring it up with a doctor or whatever.Should I bring this up to a doctor?",1635025543,5025,997

Anxiety,"Do you consider yourself happy? Why? of all, let me say that: I'm not feeling depressed. I've been tere, as well as burned out before, and I don't think this is my current state now. In fact, when I write this I'm in an okay mood after doing an activity I liked this morning. I believe that happiness is a state, not an end goal, and that it's a bumpy ride.  I've always considered myself happy, but that seems to be a lie I was telling myself. said that, I suspect I'll never be happy, because: I'm always really tired, even though I wasn't ever diagnosed with anything medical related to it. When someone asks me for feedback, I can only think of the disadvantages/points of improvement, never the advantages/strenghts of an option or someone. The points above really impair my communication. Even though I always try my best to be upbeat and great to work with, many people just seem to not like me or enjoy to be with me (e.g. colleagues at work, people doing services for me in my personal life, like barbers or construction workers). When I think when was the last time I was truly happy, I can't answer. Even the things I want the most, when it comes the time for them, I'm just indifferent and following the plan. Nowadays I have everything I need and I don't see the need to strive for more. I'm at a job that it's okay and pays well, and even if there would be better ones, that would cost me money and the increase of happiness at work would be offset by unhappiness in my personal life. you been there? What did/would you do?I suspect I'll never be happy. And you?",1635022946,1576,294
Anxiety,"Hello guys, I am finally coming to terms with my anxiety disorder. I am finding it rather overwhelming at the moment, but that is my own fault due to the situation I have put myself in. For years I have just put it down to a personality trait or acted like my mental thought process was normal for everyone. However, working life has made me realise that this is not as common as I first believed. Basically, before a task I have confidence, but then suddenly I start to question myself, my ability and then this impacts my output. For example, I’ve been working away from home on a boat as a chef. I am not anxious about the living situation, but now I’ve developed this worry about work and now I can’t seem to do anything when cooking. I overthink everystep and fail to do the things I know. I am dreading interactions and seem to be taken the piss out of by fellow colleagues. Making things worse. The confusing thing is that I am often the most arrogant person, confident and outgoing.

I'm like a sponge for knowledge, specially related to science or technology. The problem is... Anxiety affects my learning process by a TON. I don't know how to make it work... Learning in general is not difficult to me at all... Nor i care about what other people think but... I still somehow get overwhelmed while learning... I try to absorb everything as fast as possible... I start getting very anxious... I bite my nails... I shake a lot... I start walking a lot around my bedroom. tart drinking a lot of water... And not only that but my stress levels peak, giving me headaches, neck pain and inability to focus at ALL. Can somebody explain why this happens and how to treat it?

Anxiety,"For reference I’m 17M. Always had anxiety and figured it’d get better if I just did this or that or maybe gave it time but it’s progressively gotten worse and I’m ready to go to the doctor about getting prescribed something for it. Before I go I would just like to have a general idea of what might be best for me and be more prepared. But of course i will listen to the doc. anxiety is physical more than anything. Being slightly nervous or embarrassed will lead to sweat beading down my hands, face, armpits, my face and neck turning bright red, my words slurring. My mind goes blank and my entire being screams “run.” This all only increases the mental fear I already have. It’s like a positive feedback loop. my limited research, I was thinking I might do best with something light and safe like buspar for the long term and get a script of Xanax for big occasions. I want to avoid ssris because of side effect profile, and i think I would do much better with benzos because my symptoms are pretty much clear cut signs of a way overactive CN. I really want to avoid anything that might trigger anhedonia or bad fatigue because that sounds just as bad as anxiety. What do you think? any advice on how I should approach my parents about this? They are very traditional and would probably think I was being overdramatic. I doubt they would understand.

Anxiety,"o I am a teenage male who struggles with moderate to severe panic disorder, (I also am diagnosed with ADHD and social anxiety). Often not my panic attacks occur for no reason, but there are things that trigger my panic attacks to be worse. When I am at the house my anxiety is more to the mild side, sometimes moderate depending on the situation.  panic attacks are usually more severe in the car, I already find it hard to get a satisfied breath, usually it feels like something is weighing my chest down (anxiety and stress). ometimes I yawn to try and get a satsified breath.  I get in the passenger of the car I'm usually fine when we're driving off our st and through our neighborhood. But once we leave the neighborhood whereas there's bigger roads and bigger traffic, even though it's nothing I really think about, my anxiety sets off for no reason. It gets hard for me to breath and get a satsified breath so my chest will feel pressure and I would feel like I'm choking, my hands and feet will also start to tremble which makes me feel like I would pass out. I don't experience claustrophobia in the car but when I experience a panic attack In a vehicle I begin to feel claustrophobic. And often times I need to physically move to cope which I can't always do in the car so I often feel more claustrophobic and stuck which makes me freakout more. ometimes we stop the car so I can calm down but often times we can't always stop because of traffic or appointments. o there's been times I nearly opened the car door while driving because my anxiety was bad enough to make me feel like I was choking or about to pass out. I can't eat or drink in the car unless we stop because of how bad it is.  never struggled with anxiety in the car until this year and it's often for no reason. I personally think my symptoms are often worse in the car because i don't know how to properly cope in the car and because I often focus on too much things at once while in the car, but often the panic attack occurs for no reason.Anytime we'd stop the car I always dread going back in the car because I dread another panic attack.  used to take Zoloft prescribed by my old pediatrician but it didn't work after a while so she switched me to celexa, which I never took because it was a antidepressant. And my mother wanted me to get on actual anxiety medication so she's going to be having me see a new doctor this or next week. grandmother gave me half of her Xanax the other day because it was really bad which helped me alot in the moment.

Anxiety,"idk if this can be triggering for some people so just a general trigger warning for discussion and brief mention of fears of pregnancy, paranoia, health, toxic relationships (not into detail), etc. im sorry if this is not how ur supposed to format things. ive never posted on reddit before so i dont really know how any of this really works. a senior in high school and i have had high levels of anxiety since 6th grade. in sophmore year i noticed that it kind of morphed into a cycle. i would be super anxious about a certain topic for a few months, get maybe a month or a few weeks of calm where it felt like my anxiety was gone, and then it would start up again with a new topic. almost as if my brain was trying to find something to be anxious about. in my sophmore year of high school i was dating someone who was a senior in high school (so a few years older than me) and i had a pregnancy scare (i was coerced into a lot of things i wasnt comfortable with). i got anxious about being pregnant for about a year which is very unreasonable considering a pregnancy only lasts 9 months. it was almost a crippling fear that was constantly on the forefront or the back of my mind, sometimes better sometimes worse.  i got over that i think i started to get a fear of leaving my house. every time i left the house i felt like some unforeseen circumstance (car accident, freak accident, random firearm discharge, creepy stalker, etc) was going to happen that would kill me unexpectedly.  i got over that its now health anxiety. not just covid (which is what it started with) but now its everything. if my side hurts for a second i think i have lung cancer or something of the like. my chest hurts for a second and i think im having a heart attack or heart disease. i constantly overthink my breathing patterns and think theres something wrong with my lungs. im worried about a freak abnormal health situation happening to me that is uncurable and rare. affecting my schooling a lot currently. i get so anxious about the future when i try and do my schoolwork that i get so overwhelmed and restless that i cant do anything. i find it easier to give up and not try than deal with the severe anxiety and imposter syndrome i feel from trying *too* hard and risking failure. this really sucks because 1) im in an advanced program that is very very hard so i really need to study. im barely scraping by 2) i have a lot of passion with my poetry and writing and want it to become a real career one day, but im so scared of starting big works and trying hard because i am anxious about how people will view me or anxious about completely failing what ive always wanted to do in life. i feel like if i dont achieve these things i wont be happy, but i find it even harder to start because of all the anxiety i feel towards everything. college apps end in a week for most colleges and i haven't even started due to my anxiety. gotten to the point where i feel a sense of emptiness and emotional isolation a lot of the time. i dont really have anyone to talk to about this stuff. i have friends but they are not emotionally available, and they dont talk to me much, they moreso talk to each other (or maybe my anxiety is making me feel this way? idk.). i feel like the odd one out. i dont find interest in anything so much so that when i dont have anything to do or a place to be ill just sleep because nothing excites me anymore. i have concert tickets to see one of my favorite bands tomorrow and i dont feel anything towards it. not excitement. nothing. i dont want to talk to anyone because i feel this tremendous sense of ""other-ness"" when i do, like i cant relate to anyone. i just constantly feel seperate from everything. i dont really know how to help myself or what to do. ive tried therapy and counseling multiple times before but my insurance is shit and doesnt cover it and i havent had good experiences with the people i have tried either (its even harder as a poc to get help for these sort of things). my mother doesnt want me to get diagnosed with anything because she doesn't want it to follow me on my record and set me back because im black, which i understand, but im really struggling. i have been struggling since 6th grade.  sucks because i was regarded as a gifted student for the entirety of my younger years (finished half of my required math credits for high school before i even stepped foot on campus freshman year, always been a big reader, etc.) academics has always been a big thing i prided myself on and now i'm struggling a lot (my grades still look good on paper. i always find a way to get my grades up, but i still don't know any of the content in my classes. if i continue this way, though, i wont make it very far.) a lot more but this is already too long. if anyone has any advice on how to deal with this please share. sorry if a lot of the info doesnt seem relevant or if the text seems scatterbrained and makes no sense. i am kind of rambling because my mind is everywhere. for context, not sure if its relevant or not: the pandemic started at the end of my sophmore year (it cut the school year short) through till the end of my junior year.anxiety feels like it is ruining my life and i dont know what to do. i used to have so much potential. does anyone know how to handle this?

Anxiety,"o first things first - i took 25mg, i am not prescribed ertraline but i tried it like 3 times bc my boyfriend has been prescribes with it (he has very similar symptoms to mine and i thought I'd just take it once to try it out bc my appointment is going to be in December). I know this is stupid, i know it can be harmful if taken with other meds and so on. I don't take any other antidepressants or similar tho so no MAOs or other RIs.The first time I didn't even have any side effects. I just felt more motivated, it got me out of bed and stuff.The second time I took it spontaneously before work and didn't eat anything (huge mistake) which resulted in awful side effects (or a mild serotonin syndrome?): Being hot and cold, sweating, mind racing, anxiety, kinda feeling dizzy, couldn't focus, felt like i was getting a panic attack, diarrhea, nausea, tremors, excessive shaking (i mean it i twitched like crazy it was the worst). Just the worst basically. At some point i finally got my hands on some food and it got a little better &amp; it was almost time to go home for the day so I could muscle through. I think i just layed down at home or watched a movie.Today though i actually ate something to prevent this. It didn't help. The anxiety came it about an hour after taking the meds and it's been about 10-11h now since I took them and it's only gotten slightly better. I think it's bc i am having some IB related issues atm and had diarrhea after breakfast (whether that was the IB, the ertraline or both idk) so I'm guessing that's why I'm having strong side effects. As of rn i am having some bowel issues, I'm rlly RLLY fucking anxious and have like a tightness in my muscles? imilar to the second time I took it, it's just super annoying. I ate a little but so far it didn't rlly help. At times i can distract myself so I can just watch a video but rn my anxiety is rlly bad and i just need some clearance on not having serotonin syndrome (im 99% sure i don't have it but everyone here with health anxiety / who has been on Zoloft knows how fucking weird it feels).If anyone could clear whether I need to worry or not and what you did to calm yourself down / distract yourself it would be more than welcome!(And yes, i won't take it again in the future unless I'm prescribed, i hate this lmao)Taking Sertraline 25mg / Zoloft as a semi-first and having worse anxiety - serotonin syndrome?",1635010154,2400,456

To this day I’m convinced that I messed up the game by losing track of time in the last few seconds and a guy on our team scored, and I had to make the call that it was a goal even though my timer had missed a few seconds. time I showed up to school after a few days on acne medication and was beet red in the face and everyone was asking if I was okay. time I was at a protest and was speaking to friends in the back, unknowingly speaking over the presenter because I couldn’t hear the microphone and looked obnoxious.  list goes on, and I always struggle with these little memories coming up and disrupting my life. ometimes I wish I had someone to sit with me and just listen to these experiences and tell me I’m overthinking them, and they aren’t as bad as I thought.Cant stop ruminating",1635007175,1199,232

Anxiety,"*Posted previously in r/OCD and r/Psychosis. orry for spamming the whole Reddit, bear with me. I'm trying to get as much opinions as possible.* I've had OCD, full blown anxiety and mild depression for a solid 5 years now but I've showed signs of them well before that. During all these years my obsessions have taken so many forms that it'd be difficult for me to list them all. It's worth mentioning I've never gotten it treated, no CBT, no RIs, nothing. Got it diagnosed by a specialist but never continued therapy and continued using medication. the last year or so, I've developed a fear of being watched (paranoia). Not exactly fear in the literal meaning of the word but more of a really really uneasy feeling. of my strongest obsessions was the fear of developing schizophrenia later in life. I wouldn't have cared that much if my first cousin hadn't been full blown paranoid schizophrenic and if I hadn't used illicit drugs in the past. My psychiatrist told me the genetic predisposition is negligible. No other family history of psychosis but bipolar and OCD. I'm so so convinced I'm gonna become like my cousin really soon. I constantly compare every action I do to hers and try to avoid her behaviour traits I see in myself as much as possible. comes my current obsession - a few months ago I masturbated in my room but forgot to shut my blinds properly (or so I thought). Wouldn't have cared that much if there wasn't that huge apartment complex just fifteen meters in front of my room. ounds insane but I'm ashamed of looking through that window and into the building outside because of the fear that someone might have seen me and I might get blackmailed with a video of me doing my dirty little secret. Or people might mock me when I'm outside. Not that it couldn't happen if I don't show up on that window too lol. I don't think I will survive the following harassment and bullying. I was bullied my entire life, I don't want this to continue. I don't live in the best neighborhood either.  What is even crazier is that I might be so far away from home but if I hear some people laughing near me, my brain would somehow associate it with the stuff I mentioned above. It's ridiculous. I avoid eye contact with people around my neighborhood and have a feeling a lot of people know about my secret, I'm extremely suspicious. If someone looks at me a bit odd, I get a panic attack. Avoiding certain places of my house is a part of the whole game as well. Well, in theory it's possible they *might* know about it but that chance is insanely insanely low. till, it gives me hellish anxiety. A lot of time has passed since then but the episodes don't subside. sounds literally like paranoia, checked its symptoms and I got them all. I (still) don't have some bizarre beliefs like the aliens are stalking me or the government is trying to poison me but I feel like they might appear soon. My fear is rooted in reality but it just won't go. I will only be at peace if I ask those neighbours in front of me if they have seen anything but this sounds even crazier. I just want to not care and not fear the worst. does that sound to you, does it sound like I'm becoming a schizophrenic? As I said, I understand that the chance of the stuff I mentioned happening is quite slim but it still brings me immense amount of anxiety.

Anxiety,"I find myself forgetting to show attention, consideration, and appreciation and I have noticed that I tend to focus on sharing what's going on inside of me without equally looking into the other person (at least when I'm anxious). As a result, I've decided that I'm going to make a conscious and concerted effort to focus less of the ""spotlight"" on me, shut up and listen. Doing this so far has made me feel better about my relationships and making connections. anyone else experience this?Do you find that your relationships take a hit because you're always focused on what's going on inside you as opposed to focussing on the other person?",1634988042,641,111

To a degree I think it's normal but I think there is something else going on here since it's been happening for a very long time now. usually was the one that would end my relationships after the honey moon phase since I saw no point in being in a relationship anymore if it doesn't give me that high. But this time I think I really have someone special and I really don't want to break up but these repeating thoughts really make it hard to stay content in this relationship.   I always had anxiety but I learned how to cope with other symptoms but this one is really difficult to get around with. want to be grateful and I really know how hard it is for some people to find anyone at all and I really have someone that loves me and cares for me and this feeling really makes me doubt the relationship and kind of pushes me towards the thought process of, "" I will be happier if I break up "" which I know in reality is probably not true and I will regret that decision sooner or later.  anyone experience this and does anyone have any tips of how to deal with it?

I miss wanting connection. Now I'm afraid and the fear is uncompromising. Except in small, anonymous blurbs, where I can talk about it from the shadows. I have many problems and I can't fix any of them.

Anxiety,"I won't go into details but earlier this week I wanted to adress an important subject with someone I'm close with that we needed to talk about. I brought the subject up, fully ready to share my opinion and hear about theirs, but as soon as the conversation started, my mind disconnected and I found myself unable to say the things I really wanted to say. I even wanted to dismiss the entire thing, and I kinda ""agreed"" easily with them to end the talk sooner and not expose my point of view. I know they were aware I was in a weird state afterwards, and they didn't insist on keeping the conversation going. a few days later I've had time to reflect on it and I feel it's not right that I brought up a difficult subject and then didn't even participate in it, letting the other person open up about it and not me. And I think it's important to have this conversation to keep going forward. both dislike talking by message, but I'm afraid that I won't be able to talk about it in person next time either. o I'm contemplating sending them a vocal message where I say everything I wanted to say the other day, and correct some things that I said. And of course explain that I wanted to talk about it, but found myself unable to despite feeling ready beforehand so I prefer to send them this message to be truthful and honest with them. info, the subject in question is important for me, whereas they don't think about it that much and don't like asking themselves too many questions about it. If I never bring it up again, they won't either. o I'm feeling conflicted about insisting on it. it okay or too much ?Is it weird to bring up a conversation we had days ago again by texting ?",1634985217,1681,318

And it’s made me crazy. It’s sent me into a loop, and I don’t know why I thought it was about me. I’ve never been called ugly before, I’m always complimented for my looks and for some reason I thought she was talking about me. WHY!! I dwelled on it for a week, and then decided to ask her if she was talking about me. he said she didn’t and that it wasn’t directed at me. But then my “gut” says she‘s lying even though she actually seemed like she was being honest. I haven’t been able to let it go.  been eating me up inside for 2 months…. that someone could think I’m “ugly” when I’m not.

Anxiety,"I am a final year medical student, and during my last exams a lot of things were coming together (e.g. mum diagnosed with cancer, exams, etc.).  all know these moments when our nervous system just spirals out of control. In these times, it is very hard to ""use thoughts as an antidote"" and often breathing/relaxation techniques are also hard to use. While I do not suggest, that we should medicate all bouts of anxiety away, sometimes (e.g. before an exam), these bouts take way more than they give. In these moments ""pharmacological crutches"" can be incredibly helpful. However, most of the meds available have intense downsides (e.g. duration of action, impairment in cognition, drowsiness, etc.). though I had access to pretty much all the drugs I wanted, I was very hesitant due to their side effects. However, there was one substance that saved me. A substance I have never heard anything about in med school (likely because it cannot be patented and therefore no money to be made and therefore few studies on it being conducted): **L-Theanine** found the occasional dose of L-Theanine (e.g. 125-250mg 2x per day whenever bouts of anxiety arose) to be incredibly effective and much underappreciated.  Modulates glutamate receptors (AMPA, kainate, NMDA) of action:** 2-4 hours (enough to soften bouts of anxiety completely) 125mg worked best for me (250mg made me almost too calm) of action:** around 30min Does not dumb you down (like e.g. benzos)* does not impair cortical plasticity like other calming drugs (e.g. pregabalin)* is cheap* is very safe* works on an as-needed basis* does not impair cognition (in fact, L-theanine is nootropic)* does not make you drowsy (at low dosages)* pretty much no side effects* very little tolerance develops if just used on an as-needed basis only works on as-needed basis (and not general anxiety) (this could also be a positive) you have not tried L-Theanine before and/or are hesitant to take more potent drugs (which should never be taken lightly as they do come at a price) and/or you just need to soften some anxiety in times when you need to be cognitively sharp (e.g. date, exam) I suggest you give L-Theanine a try.An extremely effective and safe way to calm bouts of anxiety within 30minutes",1634976902,2245,375

Anxiety,"TW: hospital, doctors, death, BM's. I've always been anxious, socially mostly, but also about death. I was never particularly health anxious until recently. Back in March shit really hit the fan for my little family when my boyfriend's chronic condition spiraled out of control. His pancreas is deformed and it ended up fucking up his gallbladder, kidney and liver. He was transferred to a hospital out of the city and he was our primary worker as we have two school age children and neither of us feel safe sending them in person. I was lost and scared and I had no idea what the right choice was. I ended up deciding to move my kids and I out of our home and into an extended hotel for the time. My boyfriend was in and out of critical condition from March until late July. He came to our hotel with a feeding tube and a home nurse who I thought would come several times a week, but she only came once to teach me how to do everything. At first things were going fine but money became a problem and we couldn't afford the place we'd been at for months. We found a cheaper place, it was full of roaches and other unmentionables that our kids weren't safe around. We borrowed money from everyone who could possibly give it and found an Airbnb for cheaper than the price of a rental in the area, we got it for two months and things seemed okay. My partners health was looking up and he had so many doctors who could care for him. But I was losing my mind, it was so much stress, and work, and I just didn't let myself feel it until I felt it all I guess. I was drinking heavily and smoking heavily and one night I woke up with a pain in my left shoulder, this pain migrated chestward and it's still kicking now almost two months later. I've had two colds since then and the last one is just now subsiding. I went to the ER for my shoulder and chest pain but they only ran an ECG and sent me home. At this point I was doing as much gig work as possible to keep us a float but I couldn't bring myself to do it anymore. I'm too scared I'll have a heart attack in the car driving. I haven't eaten more than 900 calories in a day since and my sodium content is as close to none as possible now. I quit drinking, quit smoking, literally anything I could think of to make my heart better, I did, but it still hurts. I'm so afraid that I don't sleep unless someone is awake to watch me and make sure I'm not dying. Down to about four hours a night. I want to go to the doctor so bad but I can't afford to see anyone available now and so my appointment isn't until almost a month away. I got into a psychiatrist much quicker though and he prescribed me ertraline. I've taken three doses now and my forth will be tomorrow, but I can't shake this feeling that I might be dying. I feel like everyone's ignoring me, despite the fact that I've never done this before, as in had my anxiety manifest itself in physical pains that weren't just a slightly sore jaw from clenching or shaking. I made a mistake and googled too hard. I deleted it yesterday because I wasn't okay anymore and now I can't decide if I'm actually hurt or just looked at so many heart attack and heart failure symptoms that my brain is just doing this. I'm just here to vent but Incase I get better or you know, less likely, keel over while eating my oatmeal I want to list what's currently happening. Maybe you'll have the same thing and I can at least feel a little less crazy. months of chest pain2 months of left shoulder pain2 months of left armpit pain1.5 months of terrible heartburn and constant belching5 days of extreme IB.

I just feel like nothing I do is honest and it’s all some fake attention seeking plan I made up. Does anyone have the kinda the same thoughts or situation?I don’t trust myself,1634969597,595,113

Anxiety,"First of all i want to clarify don't have support from a therapist sadly can't afford It so all I say is from what I'm trying to understand from myself. know I have an anxiety disorder but from some years now there's something that happens to me that even though it felt different I called it anxiety and it's when anxiety and panic attacks gets triggered by stuff that somehow remembered me stuff that I think that traumatized me. from an abusive home, and dealt with real poverty for many years. Now when someone raises their voice on the street or they start arguing even on tv, i have to cover that sound because I get extremely anxious and if can't cover it I just ran out of the place.  few months ago someone broke a book accidentally and I had a panic attack because  it reminded me of when my father just teared one of my brother's books because he didn't listened to something he said and then beat him. I felt an intense fright and pain for a random book getting broken. for last yesterday I was short for rent for less than 4 dollars and I didnt have cash atm, i had to explain to the landlord if i could pay him those 4 dollars next month but just thinking of doing it gave me a pretty bad panic attack I think it was because since I was 14 until my 20 my parents would send me to confront the landlords when we couldn't pay rent because they thought they wouldn't be so harsh to me but they still were and I had to stand adults insulting me and my family countless times for many years. I hated it but they still forced me. don't know very well how ptsd works I don't have medical help but it made sense to me since I just get so bad when it triggers these memories even tho theres no real harm I feel an intense fear and cant stop crying and no matter how much i repeat it isn't happening now I don't feel better.  it isn't ptsd what it's their name? o I can at least get some more info about it and try to overcome it.Is it PTSD or just anxiety?",1634965727,1961,384

Anxiety,"o, lets talk about what has been on my mind. I am in college and the online environment made it hard for me to learn, but also easy to cheat. I was in my Econ class and I was failing for a bit. I then panicked as I needed to pass the class and I cheated. I used a website where you can post questions to get answered and I did so throughout the course. Later on I realized what I had done and stopped and I failed the class. lets talk about now. For one I feel so much guilt and regret about it. I never got caught but I felt like an awful person to get away with it. I confessed everything, and I was never scared of any punishment. Logically, a ton of students cheated during the pandemic and I know that, but the anxiety made me fear the worst would happen (still does at times). I wish, at the time, I knew what I was doing, but I was more worried about the grade. I feel so bad about it and I feel like a terrible person.  let us move into the confession part. At first I confessed to my professor but was a bit broad, and I fear if he finds out more he will be upset, and I want to hopefully talk to him and work things out. But I wrote out everything to my school's Associate Dean and was expecting the worst. But when I met with them they were very proud of me for coming forward. They praised my integrity and were more worried about how much shame, guilt and anxiety I was feeling. I am grateful for their generosity don't get me wrong, but part of me feels like I want to be punished. I just always panic and worry about the worst happening. I just feel like this awful person and I fear I ruined my life and everyone will be disappointed in me. Part of me just want's to move on and get over with whatever may happen, but I feel that ties in with the whole wanting to be punished ideal I am so stuck on. can live with the consequences, but I fear that many may see me in a bad light. I just want people to see me as a good person who made some past mistakes, which I have owned up to on many occasions. I just hope whoever sees this can hopefully see me as a good person, all that matters to me is that I did the right thing and I feel I did so. And if anyone has any advice to move on or deal with anxiety/depression let me know. The one thing I do know is that life goes on, and I can say I am a better person for it now and have learned a lot of valuable lessons.I feel like a failure",1634964481,2399,493

Anxiety,"Hello everyone I'm 18 years old and whenever I lie down to my bed, or get up and stand still, I feel my heart beating hard, but not specifically fast. I lie down I can hear my heart beating and its really annoying that makes me feel uncomfortable. I was born with a biscupid heart valve, but I get checked yearly and they haven't found a problem yet. also had a checkup 2 weeks ago with my cardiologist who told me my heart is fine(he did an ekg and echo), but I have some arrythmias(both brachycardia and tachycardia) . I also have chest pains which are sharp and last for a few seconds.My blood pressure usually varies from 13/7 to 11.5/6.5 it usually is around 12/7 at rest doctor I've asked about my chest pain, blames anxiety. I also have had my thyroid checked and had some full blood tests which were all were clear. chest pains and the heart beating hard but not fast are driving me crazy. Could the arrythmias cause this? everytime I lie down and try to sleep I think I might die or something. But every other time of the day, like when I'm walking, sitting on a chair studying etc I don't feel these discomfort I'm also going to get a 48hour Holter monitor In a week or so.

One thing my counselor suggested was talking about my feelings here. I'm shuttle driver for some large clients oh, think big companies like Amazon and Microsoft, usually I'm doing fairly well in the only be back that I've ever really gotten from my three months of working here was to be careful what I say to co-workers because I was sometimes start rambling. management is absolutely amazing oh, they're aware of my anxiety and have supported me really well and communicating with me and actually getting to know me and helping me feel more comfortable around them. I've not received any write-ups ever from them and I am very grateful for that. But this week I had some personal issues going on in my life which I made my manager is aware of. Their suggestions for to try to work on separating my personal life from my work life which I feel like I'm pretty good at. week however, I received two complaints from two different clients, both were complaining that I wasn't allowing them on the bus. One was because I was taking my break and I wouldn't let them on until my break was over, in which my manager just told me to go park in another lot instead of in the pickup zone which I'm doing now.  the one that's really kicking up my anxiety is the complaint that I told a passenger that she couldn't ride the bus when in fact I was directing her to a bus that had the same exact timetable as me that was directly in front of me because my bus is rear heater wasn't working at the time and it was a particularly cold morning. I started out by beginning to explain when a stop assistant came up and interrupted me and started talking to the customer. If the customer than angrily is claimrd that I wouldn't let her ride the bus before storming off to the other bus. very day I immediately brought it up with my territory manager and explain the situation. he basically told me next time just let them on no matter what and to never redirect into another bus. Which I said okay too. But today my other territory manager as I was talking to them told me just so I know he was aware of a complaint that came in regarding that issue. explained the situation to him because he's my afternoon territory manager and the situation happened with my morning manager. He said okay and I told him it wasn't going to happen again.

I have social anxiety, and this “rumoured” diagnoses was uncomfortable, so I didn’t really react and the convo moved on. A few days later at like 1am my brain randomly told me that I reacted or did something in response to the comment this girl made in a way that suggests I’m ableist or somehow discriminatory. I have no clue where this idea came from, as nothing in my beliefs or morals aligns with this at all &amp; because it was a few days ago, I couldn’t remember exactly how I responded, which caused me to spiral even more. Now I’ve been anxiety ridden for days over this, thinking that it’s true and this girl has told others about this and that everyone thinks I’m a horrible person. It’s killing me that i cannot remember every single detail of this convo, but I am so certain that at worst I was awkward about it, but this thought has me paralyzed and sick.

Anxiety,"I have made some amazing progress in the last years. I still have an immense amount of anxiety, but like with everything else in my life I have found that trying and failing and trying again is the only way to improve. I would say that in the worst of your anxiety your focus should be breathing. Don't let your body go into overdrive. I am not speaking about panic attacks as I don't have much experience with those. Meditation, mindfulness, whatever works for you.  don't shame yourself after. Anxiety makes me feel weak sometimes. Out of control. Crazy. But I don't fight it anymore. I recommend checking out the DARE program. It really helped me see that to embrace anxiety is the only way to get through it. (They have a free app with some exercises.) I learned to do something which is called 'challenging my thoughts' and finding the 'cognitive distortions'. The app woebot introduced me to this exercise and it has helped me calm down and mostly stop the endless cycle. Which mostly ends with 'i hate myself', 'this will never get better', 'why can't I make it stop.  I do recommend a therapist or psychologist if your funds allow you. But I would add that it is important to be honest with your therapist and to have trust that he or she is there to help you. It took me 2 years to have complete trust in my therapist. ometimes I wish I got there sooner, but the important part is I got there. After I started trusting her I felt a little safer. I believed her when she said I was doing a good job and that I was far from a hopeless case.  what helped me even more, but was also one of the hardest steps I ever took was talking to my friends and family about how I felt. I am still not amazing at recognizing my own feelings sometimes which makes it hard to communicate. But the only thing that helped, was doing it over and over again. Trying again and again. In the beginning I couldn't even do it without yelling or it came out in outbursts. Then I had the hardest time saying or talking about it without crying. Now I can talk about it without shame and just talk about it. I cannot express how freeing that was.  the work doesn't stop. This is the thing that was very hard for me to swallow. Why was there no magic fix that made me better and took all my anxiety away. Why did I have to be punished with this. elf-pity, while extremely understandable and very easy to fall into that trap, didn't get me anywhere. Every day I find a new challenge that I didn't know I would have. But the truth is, it gets easier. Because you have done this before and most of the time it works. For example I was very late in live with dating and romance, because of my anxiety about opening up and being rejected. But then my anxiety became even bigger when I didn't have any experience. o the last 2 years have been extremely hard in that aspect of my life. Most people would say that I was pretty unsuccesful. But the girl who was crying 3 years ago, because she was so afraid to be in pain that she didn't live at all, would be so proud of me.  last piece of advice is personal and different for everyone, but after trying to avoid medication and even quitting cold turkey, because I wanted to be normal, I started my medication again (a different kind) almost a year ago. And to be honest it gave me something I had been begging for for years, which was some resting periods. ome sort of break of the non-stop thoughts in my mind. A little extra breathing room. am a 27 year old women who started dealing with my anxiety when I was 20.

I worked at a gigantic company before (90k+ employees worldwide) and it was hell because nobody could help with anything, everybody was always tired and moody, nobody cared about each other and I was expected to throw my mental health away for them, but now that I get an opportunity to work with a small company where I’ll have much more independence and work directly with and for the owner, assisting with things I’m good at and know well, plus helping a company grow, my mom doesn’t like it and makes me feel like shit about it. I know she wants me to have a good job but this isn’t forever, I’m not gonna retire at this company, I’m not gonna die at this company, maybe I won’t have benefits now, but the company will grow and I’ll get those benefits and a better salary eventually, the whole point of the my job will be to assist with things like this, so why not? Any job is better than no job. A job is a job, and I need the money. Why can’t she just be happy for me?? Why talk shit like this when she knows it’ll trigger my anxiety?? It’s like she wants me to feel like shit, like she wants to trigger my anxiety on purpose. I spoke to my internship supervisor, who is an HR analyst and specialist, said it was a good opportunity, and she definitely knows more about it than my mom who teaches snot-nosed children their ABCs.I got the job but",1634939378,2247,431

Anxiety,o I have generalized anxiety. As you may know everything in life works a bit different when you have anxiety. Well I'm about to turn 27 and I have no idea of what to do with my life. I'm so anxious all  the time thinking about what a I going to do long term that its consuming me. I finished my BA and am currently (and struggling bc of anxiety) to finish graduate studies. Friends and family think that I got my shit together but it I feel like I am uncapable of getting a real job.

I've known I've had some form of anxiety for a long time but never had panic attacks I always counted myself lucky in that regard. I moved to England for Uni a month ago and it's all been getting to me, my inability to properly make friends and then my string of bad luck keeping in communication with friends (I thought I was good friends with someone but after getting left on read for awhile I feel more like an annoyance to them than a friend) and my complete shut off lifestyle that this has led too.

Also, is it likely that the primary will prescribe me with something, or will he likely refer me to a psychiatrist?  don't really mind going to see one, it's that I don't really want to hold it off anymore and want to feel normal..  advise is welcome.

Anxiety,"I often get panic attacks and my nausea induced anxiety kicks in when I know I have an important meeting. Even worse when I’m a small office room where I feel my cluster phobia activate. 5 mins before my meeting I ran to the restroom and started dry heaving (skipped lunch for this reason).  meeting was with our CEO and HR, and wasn’t prefaced about what we were discussing. CEO came late so I was chatting with HR which helped. Eventually the CEO came and we met in the conference room. First few seconds were rough and very uncomfortable , but that ended up being the peak. The rest of the meeting was smooth sailing and my anxiety dropped down to a comfortable level, and I felt great after.  anyone who has similar issues and face the same situations, just remember your mind truly does make things seem worse than they are. If it’s an unavoidable situation like a meeting with your boss, just look forward to that “anxiety drop,” especially if it’s your first meeting. I’m feeling much more confident.  I think I’ll always have the nausea, but if I keep putting myself in these situations, I think I’ll start to feel more comfortable. At least I hope so.Meeting with my boss",1634934471,1180,213

Anxiety,"I haven’t worked in a few months because of my mental health. I went back on medication for depression and anxiety. And I also went back to therapy. I had to quit my last job because it was giving me so much anxiety. It was a doggie daycare and boarding place and the dog fights were no joke. I was so scared every shift a fight would happen. And it would get so crowded and busy and loud I would have anxiety attacks. Too many dogs to watch for only two people in there. Then I had a bad breakdown and decided to focus on my mental health for a bit. I think it’s time to look for a job again. Does anyone have good suggestions on what to look for? I’ve had anxiety attacks at every job I’ve had and it very embarrassing to cry in front of coworkers. I’ve worked at a paint your own pottery place where the human interaction was a lot and stressful when busy on weekends and during holidays. Worked at a clothes store, worst fit for me so far, way too much human interaction and conversation. I’m not charming or outgoing or extroverted.

Anxiety,"When I was in between my teenage years and my early adult years, I was absolutely wild. Drinking, drugs, and some really bad behaviour like being aggressive and an absolutely exaggerating story teller. Now, I can say with 36 years that all went pretty good. I got a wife and kids, a pretty decent job. But a couple of years I had to deal  with depressions and a constant anxiety. Panic attacks where a result out of that situation. It started in the middle of my twenties. It was a process I had to go through. If I hadn’t had done that, I wouldn’t been able to grow and to learn out of my failures. I realised why I behaved like this and was able to change. But there is one situation which still shakes my spine, and every now and then it pops up in my mind and it makes me loose my confidence. When I was 19 I wanted to demonstrate to my girlfriend that the gas pistol I owned during that time isn’t working anymore. I loaded it with a gas bullet, made the gun ready, and put it in my mouth. I was a 100 percent sure that damn thing isn’t working, but somehow I didn’t pull the trigger. I put it out of my mouth and against my head. My girlfriend just said stop it. Than I decided to shoot into the bath room, and after the shot 2 seconds later my little apartment was full of gas and both of us under shock. I could have been dead. And today I’m not sure, If I didn’t shoot because my subconscious saved me, or if it was just like a 50/50 decision. I can’t get over this situation. Today I know that only having a gun in your house makes room for accidents. But when I was younger I was out of control and couldn’t think rationally. I really want to confront this memory with confidence, but it still creates anxiety, sweating hands and blocks me from creating a clear mind about it. I hope, someone can respond to that with something I can work with, because I really don’t know how to handle these thoughts …. Thank youNearly shot myself when I was 19, and today I finally want to try to talk about it.",1634932650,2008,391

Rarely do I even think about sleep.  once this vicious cycle sets in the motion, I cannot keep my head out of thinking and being obsessed about sleep the entire day (&amp; night).  I take 1 mg Melatonin a night and it doesn’t help much. I walk 30 minutes a day in the evening, doesn’t help much. I used to do weightlifting which also didn’t help, but due to this chronic sleeplessness, I’m too tired to hit the gym.  try to follow sleep hygeine and go to bed around 10 PM but on the bad nights, I am unable to fall asleep until 4:30 AM. I go with a positive attitude to bed at 10 PM but as it takes more time and I go past the drowsy zone, my anxiety ticks up and at 3 AM I’m panic’d, and Trapped in my thoughts about “I cannot take this anymore”, “My whole next day will be a waste”, “When will this end, when will I get 8 hours of sleep and go out of this cycle”, etc.  to take this pain anymore, I went to doctor and he instead preached me “sleep hygiene” and said he wouldn’t want to give me sleep meds as I have to somehow beat anxiety myself and sleep meds may reduce life expectancy and increase chances of cancer bc I’m young.  not sure how would I do it? Are there anyone who has been through such hell and only sleep 3 hours on average.  it possible to survive on that amount of low sleep?

I feel like I have a lot of energy, but I'm tired... it also feels like there is something in my throat too... I keep thinking about how I feel physically...  And I can't get my mind off.... I'm just kinda lost in wat I need to do. Or wat helps calming it down... I just want to feel rested instead of anxious all the time...Is it anxiety...

Anxiety,"TW// rant about uncanny valley/obscure imagery cant begin to describe how much things in this category terrify me man, like broadcast systems, the voices that play on dvds or those health commercials, THAT ONE FUCKING HEEPDOG W THE EYE. i dont even know if it’s related but alarms, poor robotic voices or any rlly. i got rid of cable because the emergency broadcasting systems that play like once a month would make me hav panic attacks, its just the constant alarm beeping and the mans voice. my mom still has cable in the living room and when it plays dude i hide like a child under my blanket and cover my ears. that smiledog photo also made me rlly paranoid as silly as it sounds. any obscure unsettling imagery will do the same. i watched the walten files, a rush id say i wouldnt like to experience again. its a lot of things i think ppl find funny too, like that obey the walrus video? literally just a poor woman w polio dancing, it is easily one of the things that can bring me to tears quickest. i cry every time ive ever had to watch it man even tho i know its just some old lady. i kinda just want to know if anyone else gets so deeply disturbed by these sorts of things? like i always thought i mustve just been wimpy (which granted i am so u know)uncanny valley",1634923313,1275,242

Anxiety,"I was supposed to go to the cinema with a friend tonight to watch the movie ""Dune"". But my friend ended up cancelling and now I'm not sure what to do. still feel like I should go, because I've been low key isolating myself more than usual for the past few months and I feel having the experience of going somewhere I haven't been in a while would do me good. I also feel almost... obliged to go? Because I live in a small town and now I feel like i have to go to support our small local cinema and the idea of not going and watching it online gives me a lot of guilt (which is silly, I know..) thing is I have never been to a cinema alone, and I'm very scared I'll meet some former high school classmates or someone else I know and it will be very awkward (I can't stand small talk and I act weird when I'm stressed around people, but I don't mind being surrounded by strangers who don't know me.. does that make sense?).Any tips on how to get over this fear of the unknown?

Anxiety,"I've had crippling gad and OCD for a year straight and I think I found the best method. It's very tough and creates a billion anxiety attacks but in the end it's worth. Before I used to do CBT techniques where I would breathe and tellbmyself I'm gonna be okay. However I believe this fuels the anxiety long-term as you are stating to yourself that something's wrong and it has to be fixed. The method I found was whatever your anxiety is go with it. For example I was scared of having panic attacks in public. o before going out I would say I'm gonna have the biggest anxiety attack and when I'm outside having a panic attack I repeat to myself I am gonna have this anxiety attack forever, I will be shamed infornt of everyone, and that I will have a heart attack.

Anxiety,"I've never realized how bad my social anxiety was until I started going to college about 9 weeks ago. I have a very hard time greeting people, striking up conversations, doing presentations, etc. My heart starts going a million bpm, my hands begin shaking, I start sweating, and I lose my breath very easily. It took me this long to realize how bad my social anxiety was because every time I switched schools in the past, I always had friends switching with me, and I just joined whichever friend group they gravitated towards. But now I'm all by myself. I'm studying secondary education because I've always wanted to be a teacher. And I would like to get my social anxiety under control before I begin my career. o the question is, where do I start? heard from multiple people that having a job in retail where you're forced to interact with other people is a great way to overcome social anxiety, so I applied at Raising Canes. Lo and behold, they're asking me when I want to come in for an interview. Would it be a good idea for me to take this job? I also joined a toastmasters group that holds meetings on Tuesdays at 6pm, so I'm hoping that'll help.

My stomach is clenched tight as I'm typing this with the realization that I have to work tomorrow and it's so tiring... before you start sympathising and relating, here's the kicker. When doing work, I actually feel fine! The work gets done in a timely fashion and I'll feel normal throughout the day. It's the days when I could be creating and mentally recouperating from work that the anxiety hits. but it gets better. I'm a freelancer and work from home, making my own hours and schedule. I've been extremely fortunate in getting a streak of clients who value my work and are flexible. This new client I got a little while ago is super excited about the new relationship and has nothing but praise for what I'm doing. The reason I'm working tomorrow in the first place is so I can shift some things around and have more free time next week - it's not like refusing would impact my livelihood and whatnot. yet, I feel like absolute crap even though I'm rationally aware that I shouldn't. I'm not a subscriber to the whole ""look how many people have it worse than you"" argument, but it's definitely applicable. what does my life boil down to? Feeling alright and focused while working but ultimately wasting my time doing so, and fretting over how I'll need to get back to work soon when I'm supposed to be resting.

But here I am almost a week later the appointment noticing this big painless tooth abscess right above my damaged tooth and I’m pretty sure my dentist hasn’t seen it. I feel stupid because I forgot to mention to him that I started getting sinusitis which I’m pretty sure is due to my infected tooth. I didn’t say anything about it because it disappeared for a bit but now it’s back. just growing extremely frustrated and terrified because I don’t have health insurance yet (will only be able to enroll in a week because I’m in a new province) and I don’t have the money yet for more complex dental care. I’m constantly working, I make really long days at this new job and feel resentful about not having any free time to take care of my situation. circumstantial helplessness makes me feel like my days are counted and that I’ll die because I can’t do anything about my infection right now, and that eventually it’ll spread to my brain and heart and bloodstream.

Anxiety,"While I have a lot of anxiety in general and unintentional poor sleep in general, there’s one situation that keeps happening that I need to figure out how to reduce my anxiety about. of my sleep issues, I try to keep a strict 12am bedtime and avoid electronics or anything active 90 minutes before that. live with my bf and once in a while he stays out until 12am or later for social reasons, or for finishing work on his grad school art projects. And somehow the simple fact of him being out, or the additional mental activity with him being out, is triggers me enough that I cannot file asleep for about 3 hours after trying, and then the rest of the night is crappy restless sleep. way to help a bit would surely be to stick to my usual routine — bed at 12, and no electronics for 90 minutes before bed (stop texting him!). still, somehow the anticipation of him coming back, and not knowing exactly when he’s coming back, and that everything is okay, is enough to make me a bit on high alert. of course he’s going to be okay, so what else am I worried about?  was cheated on a lot in the past by an ex who would go screw around basically any  time we weren’t physically in the same place and would constantly lie about it. o perhaps the trauma of this lingering in me am despite the newer, much healthier relationship? But if I’m 99.5% sure my current bf isn’t going to cheat on me while he’s out, then why is that 0.5% worry enough to keep me awake?

Anxiety,"How do you all figure out when it would be better for you mentally to step back from something versus when to sort of push through the anxiety? context, I recently met this guy and we’ve been texting and he’s really nice and seems really into me, but I am having a ton of anxiety. Like every time he texts, I say out loud “oh crap”. He seems great and says really nice things but I feel like I have no idea how to respond to any of it. I suffered a pretty big loss recently, so between that and my anxiety, I just feel really unsure if I should go out with this guy and kind of push through the discomfort (bc regardless of when I start dating, there is going to be some discomfort and I’m going to struggle bc of my anxiety) or hit the pause button and work on myself a bit (when I say work on myself, I mean more practicing self care and building up my confidence). in general I feel like I struggle with this question of when to accept that I have anxiety and so some things will just feel more intense and uncomfortable versus knowing when I’ve reached my limit and need to take some time for myself.

Anxiety,"I have always had anxiety issues. In high school, I somehow turned not talking to anyone into some kind of way to feel good about myself, I liked my role of being the ""cool quiet"" kid. But as I got older I realized how I was missing out on parties, relationships, all that fun stuff that people do as they get older. Eventually I did manage to catch up with some of that. Even had a relationship. Long post, probably TMI... relationship became really unhealthy because she didn't want to have sex, even though we had been together for years and I got really upset about it. It never felt like I could talk about it without upsetting her, so I neglected my relationship, started smoking a lot more weed than I used to. Eventually, I got addicted. My addiction got worse after my mom died of cancer two years ago. I used smoking as an escape. hortly after, the pandemic started which made my addiction even worse, as I didn't leave the house for weeks at a time. The year 2020 is a bit of a blur. My then-girlfriend went on a semester abroad, I barely made any progress in my studies and just wasted my life away smoking weed in my bedroom. In the beginning of the year, my best friend died. hortly after, my girlfriend left me. To be honest, I'm not sure about the order here, maybe it was the other way around.  was about the time I decided to quit smoking. I started going to therapy. My therapist said he thought he had to put me in a clinic for me to sober up. But I did manage to quit on my own. I had a few relapses but I never got back into making it a habit. I am proud of this. my damn social anxiety. I can't get rid of it. Right now, I'm doing a semester abroad. It started okay. I forced myself to socialize a bit, I did kind of make it into  a group and I occasionally go on trips with them. But I feel this constant dread about it. Before going, I dread to go. I force myself, thinking this will improve my anxiety, and that it's not going to be so bad once you're out there and so on. But when I am out there, it's just so exhausting. My thoughts keep racing about how I'm being perceived in the moment. I can't follow the conversations around me. I can't think of anything to say. I just have nothing to contribute. ometimes I force myself to say something, anything, just to seem interested and to try to belong. But then it's mostly just some really weird dumb thing that, at least in my head, makes me seem even stranger and I end up regret saying it. But saying nothing is also not the way to go. On one of the car rides, a guy said I was on drugs. Ironic, considering my history. But apparently that's the impression I make on people. I fucking hate it.  I am, doing this supposedly awesome thing that is a semester abroad, but I can't enjoy it. I can't enjoy anything at the moment. Doing this thing to begin with I guess is a pretty big deal, considering how I lived just one year ago. But still... The anxiety has not gotten better. I'm starting to think it will never get better. feel like underneath I'm a pretty normal dude but this anxiety just inhibits me. It stops me from making new friends, from finding new relationships, from enjoying my life.  I get back home, I want to continue my therapy, but I'm not sure if I can, because I might move to a different place and a new therapist is hard to find in Germany.  just want to be normal. :(Anxiety is ruining my enjoyment of life",1634907961,3409,656

I can't even hold a job opportunity for more than 3 days to a week... 2017, I've left 4 decent paying jobs within the first week of training for fear of failing and not understand what was to come in the later days. I just make excuses like, ""I've found a different job"" or ""circumstances have changed"" etc.  feel like a fraud in the hobby that I do because of my Imposter yndrome.

My parents had this dream of me having a business of my own (to not work for people), having a happy wife etc. But everything that I do feels like I'm falling down a hole farther and farther away from the dream my parents hoped I would have. just never want to commit to anything anymore. I hyperventilate at the idea of life - having so many priorities to do. come to the point where I fear I'll forget everything and all my priorities, so I write down the simplest things on paper  like: Find a Job, Find a Wife, Go to the Gym etc on a list.  friends think I have crazy OCD to be writing this down but they don't understand that I feel like my anxiety is driving me insane.

Anxiety,"Hi, I'm  a dad to a beautiful son, he's aged  2. I love him more than anything.  I'm in my mid 30s and have a long  history of anxiety and OCD. For  example, throughout my life, I've been  worried I was gay, potentially a  psychopath, questioning my love for  partners and my son, problems  sleeping and constantly worried about my  physical health. All this has  been exhausting but it's just part of who I  am I guess.  few days  ago, I was changing his diaper after he did a very large poo.  I was  changing it as normal like I always do and there was a lot of  poo around  his private area. I was making sure every nook was spotless  when all of  a sudden a thought popped into my head: ""if you touch a  child  inappropriately, that's the sort of thing you won't come back  from"".   then did one final wet wipe of the private area and  immediately  thought: ""oh no, is that inappropriate or wrong? Why did I  touch him  AFTER I thought that?"" I felt devastated and still do because  I would  never do anything to harm my boy or any child. He's my world.  I've even talked to my wife (his mum) about this and she says it's just  the thoughts and I am giving power to them.  This  has caused me a  great deal of stress. I can't help but feel I did  something wrong, even  though I was just changing a diaper. Deep down I  know it's my  intrusive thoughts but I can't shake the bad feelings.

Anxiety,"I'm 21 male, 180cm/5,9 tall, 70kg/154 pounds weight, no alcohol, drugs or smoking, no coffee. the last week I've been experiencing very odd tension in my head, I've told a couple people about this but everyone said they have no clue what might cause it. It's very difficult to explain, it's not quite a headache, I don't feel pain, but I get mild to major dizziness attacks and feel weird tension/pressure in my head, that usually happen completely randomly, the symptoms seem to calm down when I walk outside or lay down or afternoon in general, but most of the time it's completely random when it happens. it's very mild and it's doesn't bother me, sometimes I feel very dizzy and have to sit down or lay down. tension in the head is more on the front, it somewhat feels like something heavy in the front of the head, forcing me to squint my eyes a little, as if I was tired, the symptoms usually aren't very bad, but it does interrupt my every day life I've been dealing with chronic stress and anxiety for years, been taking medication for it etc. since then my lifestyle changed drastically, I exercise regularly, I walk 40-60 minutes at least daily, I take lost of vitamins and eat healthy food, but about a month or two ago, my stress and anxiety attacks came back, so I bhought some meds to ease anxiety. I bhought Validol, ""a mixture of  menthol and methyl isovalerate"" as the leaflet says, it's supposed to ease anxiety and stress, and it did, it worked well, I took it for about a month, and took less and less as I felt better. The only side effects that are mentioned are very rare and I experience none of them, well, there is headache but as I said, my symptoms feel very different from a traditional headache. my symptoms be caused by stress or medication, or maybe it's a sign of something serious, or all above? only other two symptoms I experience is the twitching eyelid in my left eye, very often, most of the day basically, it's very mild but noticable, and it started before the dizziness symptoms, a couple days ago also the eyelid in the right eye started twitching midly as well, and the other symptom is more regular poops shortly after food or even before I eat anything, and the stool is often yellow. But I don't have abdominal pain or anything like that. the symptoms started I did measure my blood pressure and blood sugar for about a week and the results where pretty much perfect (especially sugar), I did have slightly higher blood pressure on some days but I figured it could've been from the stress, despite, I don't feel any other symptoms reminiscent of high blood pressure, I also took magnesium for a couple days to see if it helps with the twitching eyelid but there's no difference. than that, no cold, no migraine, no difficulty breathing, no pain or ache of any kind, no pain in the chest or irregular heart beat, nothing that could indicate something serious or even cause the dizziness. know my explanation is really chaotic but I'm really confused and desperate as I have no clue what might cause the dizziness/tension in my head, so please, any advice will be greatly appreciated.Chronic dizziness and tension in the head, stress or a sign of something serious?",1634904146,3210,575
Anxiety,"Hi all, I have been struggling with anxiety quite a bit and recently I’ve been struggling with the guilt. I’m currently in college and my friends are trying to convince me to dorm, while my family tells me to commute and says dorming is a waste of money. The drive isn’t too bad but isn’t necessarily convenient. Ultimately, I would like to stick with commuting as it aligns with my goals for the near future but I can’t help but feel guilty as all of my high school, now college friends, will be dorming and potentially getting an apartment together. The guilt of choosing one over the other has been eating away at me and I almost feel as if I’ll lose my friends and miss out on a lot, as they plan on getting an apartment together within the upcoming year.

Don’t get me wrong, I would love to go on roller coasters but with the accompaniment of a variety of anti motion sickness medications. He’s aware of how I feel and jokingly makes comments on how his gf doesn’t want to go to mazes or ride roller coasters and deep down it makes me feel incredibly guilty cause I would love to do these activities but I physically can’t handle them.

I think I need some advices today, to share experiences with people who know what I'm going through. o here I am. a little of background: suffering of anxiety for 2 years or so. As far as I know, I've never been the kind to be H24 stressed before. Just... Normally kind of stressed? make things really, reallyyyy short, my story is about professional burn out, my mom's disease (cancer) with... let's say a lot of plot twists, until her condition got worse and passed away when I was by her side. Add to it a pandemic worldwide situation. was already suffering of panick attacks and was under xanax when my mom was still with us. Because of burn out. she died, I was in deny for a few months. I was doing ok. Until I started to have panic attacks again, the irrational thought that every little thing I'd feel in my body was the meaning of something bad. Like a headache? It only can be a brain tumor. ee what I mean? thoughts too. I immediately made an appointment with my doctor and have been under antidepressant since then to deal with those temporary dark thoughts and lingering anxiety. been a great help! from medication, I started hypnotherapy sessions. I almost had around 15-20 sessions, at my request. These really helped me too to try to recover from burn out and being in mourning. was already doing guided meditation at home, and hypnotherapy gave me the keys to how to talk to my ""inner self"" and I manage to erased most of my constant fear of having every health issues existing. You have no idea how much of a relief it was. yeah, I'm doing better, I have no doubt about this. it's still a rollercoaster. I think I'm finally myself again and then I'll feel anxiety again and feel bad, with no motivation. learned to be tolerant and gentle about myself and to not getting upset for feeling this way (just frustrated of the situation at the most). I understand and accept it takes time. I still do have questions for people who suffered/are suffering of anxiety because of some bad events in their life. it ever go away one day?

Anxiety,"\- when I hear footsteps I assume that person is going to come to my room after only a week in the office I can already tell the footsteps of everybody apart when I just sit in front of my notebook I'm very often in fight-or-flight because I think somebody is going to suddenly show up behind me, which is why I prefer desks or also in restaurants (or just in general) sitting at tables or standing whereever I can observe the whole room + the door(s) this also means that I frequently look over my shoulder to check whether everything's safe when stuck in traffic I envision armed people showing up and starting to shoot on my car when driving in my mind I envision all the different ways I could suddenly cause an accident when just walking I am doing my best to be deadly aware of my surroundings; is anybody acting sus, could anybody have a gun, anybody who might wanna talk to me, any police officers. etc? every time I hear police siren I assume they're coming for me. officially I have a clean record but inofficially.. when somebody raises their voice (even while talking to someone else, perhaps even in a different language) I always assume it's because I fucked something up when listening music with my headphones while other people are in the room I often stop the music and just listen what's going on I am very good at spotting material that reflects light, aka pseudo-mirrors, which especially in traffic helps me notice whether other cars are approaching cuz I notice when the paint of another car suddenly gets a bit lighter (from the headlights of the approaching, but not yet visible car) when I open Instagram (I run one heck of a lot meme accounts) I always assume that the first thing I'll see is a notice that I posted something against the community guidelines and I either get shadowbanned again or they close my account completely whenever I get a notice that I violated a community guideline (which in 90% of the cases is total bs) I always assume they also close \*all\* my other accounts. losing 1 account doesn't matter, even 2-3 could go without problem, I can build them back up in a few months ez pz, but it'd be really really hard to build up a dozen again whenever I text with my boss I assume he's suddenly gonna say ""Hey \[name\], it was nice working with you, but your efforts recently haven't matched the company's expectations and I have to let you go"". I know that this won't happen unless I really f up cuz afaik there's nobody in the world with exactly my skill set, but still.. I rarely ever let my phone battery drop below 50% (neither my notebook) I know where my birth certificate is (it's the first document of my second folder for important documents that's currently in the left middle of the cabinet in my mom's workspace room) I never lost important documents before but I still prefer giving them to my mom because I'm afraid I'll lose them one day (and I know she won't) I'm very self sufficient and taught myself (or asked others to teach me) how to cook, clean, clean my clothes, do all the tax and insurance bs, I am very thoughtful of what I post on reddit and think about what I post atleast 3 times before I actually post every time I post on reddit I assume somebody, who read through my entire post history and who can also look inside my brain, is gonna comment under my post and call me out for every single thing I have ever done wrong in my entire life there are no photos of me on the internet (that I know of), also no mentions of my real *full* name or my phone number (only people I know irl + 4 others that I've talked to for atleast half a year have my number) I like learning the most important words of niche languages because ""if one day I suddenly get abducted and wake up in an old ex-soviet factory in Azerbaidjan and nobody speaks English, panish and German I would still be able to somehow find my way back home"" I am pretty good at predicting how somebody will react to whatever I might say or do, and if I sense things go south I am pretty good at talking myself out of anything, mostly out of practice of 10,000+ hours of talking to myself (I talk to myself for many hours every day, envisioning many different situations I might or might not ever enter so I'm prepared) I did/still do my best to get rid of my accent and way of talking in whatever foreign language (eg English) I speak so people don't notice I'm not from their country / can't easily tell which country I am from (which makes no sense cuz I'm open af and would p much tell anybody anytime lol) there'd be more stuff but that's what immediately comes to mind. I really gotta go back to work now.  forward to hearing your thoughts. Can you relate?Do I have anxiety?",1634896572,4715,878
Anxiety,"For no whatever reason I'll start having the anxiety symptoms and recently my body decided to start having stomach aches as well, so as soon as I leave my house I already start feeling a warm feeling in my stomach like poop is building up inside of me out of nowhere, and I have to search for a bathroom every 5 minutes. I've already tried meds once and I hated the sensation of not being myself and getting dizzy and sick all the time, so I am avoiding meds at all costs  already saw some phsichyatrists and phsychologists but I felt no improvements some of them told me to try sports. I did swimming for a few weeks and I felt no improvements either...  am tired of being my own hostage and being caged but I am not sure how to overcome this.

Anxiety,First of all i was looking at a guy that was getting their hair cut a few feet away from me whilst i was getting mine done and when i looked away from him they dropped his chair and it made me jump. After that the guy who was cutting my hair who was Turkish and couldn’t really speak English asked if i am ok and that my head is really hot. Instantly it made me panic and started to get really anxious like there was something up with me because he started talking to his mate in Turkish and looking at me same time which made me panic even more. I felt fine but him asking if i am ok triggered me for some reason. I tested my temp and it’s fine and no idea why i jumped maybe it was him dripping his chair that i didn’t expect or i am just tired. It wasn’t like someone was scaring me or making me jump on purpose. I do suffer with health anxiety and stress and hopefully the meds i am taking start helping me soon.

I'm just surviving. Always low, always depressed, but muddling through. I've even got a job, I'm not poor, I have a cat, I just survive. I meet another person online. They become a friend. We become close friends. problem is, they are on of my only friends. I'm just 'one' of theirs. I'm incredibly attached to them. Would do anything for them. They know about me and my issues and accept it. problem?

I feel worthless. Always have been, always will be. just want to mean something more to someone. The problem? I know I have issues and I know it's unreasonable to always fear that one day, they'll go away and I will be almost alone again. I always need reassurance in one way or another that no, I haven't fucked up (yet) and no, they still like to hang out with me. am I like this? It's killing me, inside. And I know it's draining on other people, too. I feel like I should just remove myself out of other people's picture again, isolate myself again. will be hard, it will be lonely, but at least I won't hurt other people and at least I won't have to be paranoid, or sad, anymore. For no reason other than the fact that I have no self esteem and feel worthless to everyone else. hate myself for being this way. I hate myself for feeling this way and what it does to others.

Anxiety,"I've been having psychosomatic back pain and tinnitus for 5 years now, and a year ago during the pandemic I got diagnosed with social anxiety disorder. Things have been going better for a long time, but working as a contractor was a continuous trigger for me: new clients every year, not being invited to the office social events, etc.  ocializing was always superficial in this job while I realized that my anxiety gets less as I actually get to know people. Being stuck in quarantine for 1.5 years didn't help either: I was no longer used to seeing anyone in person, so a single day at the office would now take all my energy. decided to switch jobs so I could work within a permanent team and feel more connected to others. This week is my first week, and I am breaking up. Every day I meet new people, some are nice, some are a bit more distant. I've barely slept since Wednesday. My back pain and tinnitus are back in full force. Yesterday I got my first real assignment and it's instant stress: huge time pressure because the person I've replaced dropped the ball during his last months at the job. I made the best of the meeting, trying to get things clear as much as possible, but I started sweating enormously because; Meeting 2 new senior people that introduced me to the project, dumping a buttload of info on me.* I've been working in an office for the whole week for the first time since COVID started and I was on my breaking point.* When asked why I couldn't make it to the big presentation, I had to tell them I've group therapy on every Tuesday morning, and I can't (and won't) cancel that for work.* It became clear that I wouldn't have any time to take a breather until coming Tuesday; which is when the project is due. That means any time I spend on staying sane (e.g. meditating) decreases the chance of this project getting done. was out of the meeting for barely 5 minutes when HR called me in, and I heard that one of the seniors mentioned my odor and told HR to talk ""man to man"" to me about it. HR asked if I knew about it.  first I was angry (which I contained, I think). Within the same meeting in which I admitted to being in therapy (e.g. I'm mentally not completely in balance), the senior person thought it would be a good idea to make me sit with HR about my odor smell. Mind you, it's something I've never been confronted with. It rarely gets this bad, and I do numerous things to make it less evident. Deodorant might mask it for a while, but in the end makes the smell much worse. o I learned to stay away from that, shower every day, and avoid light clothing. I wear T-shirts during winter to avoid getting too warm. told HR that I am aware of it, that I can spray all the deodorant I'd like but that wouldn't help, that I was stunned that I'm being confronted like that, and that it really wasn't my biggest issue. I broke down, told them about my social anxiety, my last year's depression, and that being confronted like this does not help at all. He was kind and understanding, and offered help. I knew I would have told about it at some point, but definitely didn't plan to do so during my first week on the job. I went back to work but ended up bursting in tears as soon as I locked myself into a toilet room. night I slept for 2 hours, spent most of the night crying and panicking, trying my best the calm myself, only to break down again. I want nothing more than quit on the spot, but that would be giving up without even having done any real work. Most people here are great, but the organization seems to be a huge mess because so many people left in the past year (something I wasn't happy to learn about this week, but then again that's what covid did to many orgs), and many projects are in disarray.  can no longer think clearly, so I hope some of you here can offer some understanding and advice.I started a new job and my social anxiety is freaking me out.",1634891183,3909,739

Anxiety,"Evening. First Reddit post ever. For 10+ years I have had occasional health anxiety that I just suffered through. Found out a year ago I am very susceptible to inner ear infections, which was the root cause of my health anxiety. I was able to keep the anxiety at bay until COVID now has me hyper anxious about contracting it and the results.  I am in decent health. I habitually drank beer, average 6-8 a night for no other reason than I enjoyed it.  had a particularly bad evening 5 nights ago where I landed in the ER because of the heart attack or stroke fears. To which the ER Doc said I was fine and a mixture of stress/sinus infection/OTC Cold and Flu meds were the cause. The ER doc prescribed hydroxyzine and a night off work. I have taken the hydroxyzine as prescribed and as a “side effect” my desire to drink has drastically decreased. I haven’t had a drink for 5 nights.

I’ve been dealing with anxiety and depression for more than a decade, and have never found a solution. Depression and anxiety are keeping my life from what it should be. I should be an active, charming, and social man but it has kept me from doing so many things out of unsolvable fear.I am realizing now that it’s only gonna get worse from here. I am gonna have to put myself in situations that the old me would never be able to handle and somehow I’m supposed to go through with it anyway. My hair is black, but is turning white due to stress.

I have lost all my emotions. I can’t laugh like I used to, can’t smile like I used to, can’t cry like I used to. I have no sexual desire. Everything has just gone away.

Anxiety,"Has anybody ever experienced their ears ringing with anxiety? This is actually a pretty stupid one for me, considering the fact that I have dealt with this literally my entire life. I was diagnosed with chronic sinus issues when I was very young, sinusitis and seasonal allergies I believe. I've always had a lot of issues out of my sinuses, and growing up the doctors actually wanted to put tubes in my ears to let things drain out, but having had two cousins who had the same procedure not long before, that it gave them a lot of trouble, that they deal with to this very day, my mom and dad opted out of it. The majority of the time whenever I was sick growing up, I kind of just had to tough it out, because we really didn't have the money or insurance to go to the doctor. o my ears have always been a little jacked. When I wake up in the morning they are muffled and I have to pop them, and all throughout the day they get muffled and pop and things like that, once again, I've done this my entire life. I always thought it was normal, until I developed health anxiety. But about two days ago, I was having a high-pitched ringing in my right ear, usually what will happen is that it would do that for a while and then will go away. But this time it just lasted particularly longer, which it has done for as well. I've been being freaked out and Google things, and it said it could be a sign of high blood pressure, which has been an anxiety of mine recently after my 55 year old mother was diagnosed with high blood pressure, due to her weight and poor diet. My family has a good friend who is an RN, I asked her, and she said that high blood pressure rarely shows any symptoms, and that it's usually caught through regular check-ups, and that it's almost always associated with age, weight, and diet. he said on top of that, you are 26, in great shape, workout everyday, have a very healthy low-sodium diet, and you are not overweight by any means. he said it's probably just damage done to your inner ears from having so many sinus issues for so long, but we all know how anxiety is. he also said that my anxiety may be making it more noticeable to me. Because as I said, I have dealt with this pretty much my entire life, it was so bad when I was a kid, I would lay in bed and the ringing would be so bad I couldn't sleep. Literally, every time I get in a super quiet situation or walk into a quiet room my ears have just always rang, like I said, I've just always thought that was normal until developing health anxiety, on top of that, it also doesn't help that for several years I played loud live music.

Anxiety,"I’m male 21 and got anxiety in may. I was given medication but didn’t take it. I took vitamin D and magnesium instead. Felt a lot better. As of late tho my anxiety has been absolutely fucking shit. I keep thinking I have some cancer or something serious because I feel dizzy and woozy 24/7 . I cannot think straight. My chest feels like some fat guy is standing on me. And the worst is when I feel I can’t breathe and I’m gonna die on the spot. I really hate this feeling. I stopped magnesium and vitamin D a week or three ago. I feel my worst now. I’m pale with dark , dark skin around my eyes. People at work call me a zombie. And I cannot stop fidgeting too, or moving around . I can never relax and breath. I just take short breathes. ometimes when I take enough short breathes I feel I can’t breathe in all the way, or get like a sharp pain when I breathe in. I was told by my doctor I have anxiety after my pee and blood came out normal. I also can’t sleep until 5am every, single, night. I’m scared to go anywhere and feel this way. I honestly hate this.

Anxiety,First of all i was looking at a guy that was getting their hair cut a few feet away from me whilst i was getting mine done and when i looked away from him they dropped his chair and it made me jump. After that the guy who was cutting my hair who was Turkish and couldn’t really speak English asked if i am ok and that my head is really hot. Instantly it made me panic and started to get really anxious like there was something up with me because he started talking to his mate in Turkish and looking at me same time which made me panic even more. I felt fine but him asking if i am ok triggered me for some reason. I tested my temp and it’s fine and no idea why i jumped maybe it was him dripping his chair that i didn’t expect or i am just tired. It wasn’t like someone was scaring me or making me jump on purpose. I do suffer with health anxiety and stress and hopefully the meds i am taking start helping me soon.

Anxiety," There are times when something deeply offends us to the point of lashing out, sometimes by even the smallest of things. Which can make it hard to go about our day regularly, see the whole picture of an argument, or even manage our health. it tight and see how you can put an end to your self-inflicted misery. Identify your triggers. all have something that sets us off. Whether it be repetitive behavior we witness, something someone said, politics, something we can’t change, or a combination of all four and then some. It’s important to know what’s causing the issue; if you don’t grasp what’s wrong, you can’t fix it. If you don’t know your triggers, you should reflect on past events that bothered you and try to find the exact moment you got upset. Reminiscing will also assist in determining if what happened is as bad as you think and will help see matters from a relaxed perspective. Try to rationalize your thoughts. yourself what’s so bad about what happened. How does it affect you? Why is it offensive to you? Can you stop it? How can you stop it? Also, try to avoid taking it personally. It might have nothing to do with you, so you should approach your issues with an unbiased viewpoint. Understand that you can’t control others. do as they please when they please. If they want to do something irresponsible, lazy, stupid, or inappropriate, they will go through with it, regardless of your feelings. You **can’t** change that no matter what. Instead, know what you can change — yourself. You are in complete control of your thoughts, feelings, and actions. o while you can’t force others to be something they’re not, you can be whatever you want. Consider that your actions might be a part of it. your friend lie to you because the last time they told you the truth, you lashed out at them? Did your boss dump a workload on you because you always tell them you have no plans? Did someone take advantage of you because whenever anything bad happened, you **always** brushed it off as being fine? Try to think about how your actions are affecting your “place” in the world. The truth may be surprising. Learn to let go is driving you crazy at this very moment? Whatever it is, it’s not worth it. By getting upset about it, you are giving someone else control over you, your thoughts, feelings, and health. **o stop it!** If it’s something trivial, why give someone else that power over you? Try to think about the good things they do instead of getting worked up over simple problems. If there is nothing good about them, you should walk out of their lives. Don’t put yourself in stressful situations for anyone if all they are is a source of negativity for you. Remove yourself from the equation, and don’t look back.How to Stop Getting Offended",1634878010,2761,492

Anxiety,"Has anybody ever experienced their ears ringing with anxiety? This is actually a pretty stupid one for me, considering the fact that I have dealt with this literally my entire life. I was diagnosed with chronic sinus issues when I was very young, sinusitis and seasonal allergies I believe. I've always had a lot of issues out of my sinuses, and growing up the doctors actually wanted to put tubes in my ears to let things drain out, but having had two cousins who had the same procedure not long before, that it gave them a lot of trouble, that they deal with to this very day, my mom and dad opted out of it. The majority of the time whenever I was sick growing up, I kind of just had to tough it out, because we really didn't have the money or insurance to go to the doctor. o my ears have always been a little jacked. When I wake up in the morning they are muffled and I have to pop them, and all throughout the day they get muffled and pop and things like that, once again, I've done this my entire life. I always thought it was normal, until I developed health anxiety. But about two days ago, I was having a high-pitched ringing in my right ear, usually what will happen is that it would do that for a while and then will go away. But this time it just lasted particularly longer, which it has done for as well. I've been being freaked out and Google things, and it said it could be a sign of high blood pressure, which has been an anxiety of mine recently after my 55 year old mother was diagnosed with high blood pressure, due to her weight and poor diet. My family has a good friend who is an RN, I asked her, and she said that high blood pressure rarely shows any symptoms, and that it's usually caught through regular check-ups, and that it's almost always associated with age, weight, and diet. he said on top of that, you are 26, in great shape, workout everyday, have a very healthy low-sodium diet, and you are not overweight by any means. he said it's probably just damage done to your inner ears from having so many sinus issues for so long, but we all know how anxiety is. he also said that my anxiety may be making it more noticeable to me. Because as I said, I have dealt with this pretty much my entire life, it was so bad when I was a kid, I would lay in bed and the ringing would be so bad I couldn't sleep. Literally, every time I get in a super quiet situation or walk into a quiet room my ears have just always rang, like I said, I've just always thought that was normal until developing health anxiety, on top of that, it also doesn't help that for several years I played loud live music.

I remember is being in a group listening to a presentation, telling my dad I don’t feel good, and next thing I know I’m on the floor with an area cleared around me and security officers in my face trying to see if I’m okay. I was told my face was white and I’d lost all color, and I remember not being able to hear or speak very well. It was absolutely terrifying. I managed to nod and ask for an ambulance as I wasn’t feeling too secure in my health and was terrified that something was wrong. They never really ended up giving me a clear answer of what happened aside from low iron and nerves.

I got so tired and annoyed of explaining what I was crying about, and I started telling her that she doesn’t understand what’s wrong. he got annoyed too and was like “why do we reach this point every time we talk.” I was so mad that she even got annoyed in the first place that I hung up the phone and blocked her. three days I felt a little better and unblocked her. But after a day she still hasn’t reached out to me and it just confirmed to me that she doesn’t care about me, so I deleted her from my contacts list.

Anxiety,"**Basic history:** Had a lot of bad/anxiety dreams growing up, or else I didn't remember them at all.  Good dreams are incredibly rare for me.* Have gut-issue-based anxiety (IBO, cyclical); when stomach meds are working, I don't really have bad dreams.  Would often wake up with heart racing, adrenaline going, etc.  uffered from anxiety, panic attack, and depression pre-diagnosis &amp; treatment.  till happens intermittently as treatment fades (comes &amp; goes).* Diagnosed with sleep apnea a couple years ago (helped a lot with insomnia); post-sleep apnea (on a BiPap machine now), mostly I don't remember dreaming at all, I just *sleep*) Ate some walnuts as a snack before bed recently &amp; had GOOD DREAM!  o, so, so rare for me!* I was so shocked because I couldn't even remember the last time I had a good dream that I started a project haha! I tested with peanut butter (nope), peanuts (so-so), pecans (yes, but not quite as strong as walnuts), and walnuts (several times, always yes)* Minimum is about 1/4 cup of walnuts, so there's some type of intake threshold.  eems to work best either before bed or within an hour of bed.  A few hours before bed seems to fade the effect (needs more testing). typically don't eat within a few hours before bed (due to reflux).  ince I started this project by accident, I've tested various food items (big fan of macros, so I've tested proteins, carbs, and fats).  The only consistent foods that affect my dreaming so far are walnuts &amp; pecans.  o, something inside of those nuts affect my body &amp; my brain (based on a minimum quantity &amp; time window). thinking it's either the fat or some type of micronutrients.  I recently had an annual physical &amp; nothing was out of the ordinary.  I've tested various individual macros before bed (proteins including things like beef jerky, plain chicken breast, and even protein shakes, simple &amp; complex carbs including sugar in various formats &amp; oatmeal, and fat in various individual ingredients, such as avocado) but nothing consistent outside of the nuts. far, only walnuts &amp; pecans do the trick.  Walnuts have a strong effect.  If anyone else wants to give this a try (1/4 cup of walnuts before bed) &amp; report back, I'd be interested to hear if this worked for you as well!  It seems that something within the nuts affects my biochemistry to the point where I have happy dreams that I remember instead of no dreams that I remember or bad or anxiety-filled dreams that I do remember!Walnuts before bed = good dreams",1634866348,2534,429

Anxiety,"It’s been a tough few years. In December of 2019 I found out that my dad had an affair. Christmas was absolute hell, and so was most of 2020 when I was caught in the crossfire between both my parents and each of their parents (both sets of grandparents are still alive). My dad’s parents were especially awful, always wanting to talk to me about how I shouldn’t be angry at my dad, even after I repeatedly asked that we not talk about it. Of course, then COVID hit and that’s been a tough time for all of us. Then the election came around and my mom’s parents, who sit and watch Fox News all day, started getting very belligerent with me, always starting a political argument. adly that continues to this day, and I’ve found it very difficult to have a relationship with them, especially since my grandmother is always calling Joe Biden “your president” when we talk on the phone and then proceeding to say how much she hates him, thus linking me to someone she despises. Things with my dad have been up and down, and I’ve concluded that he probably won’t be putting much effort into our relationship going forward. Things were good with my mom, but I’ve grown more distant from her because I’ve started to realize she’s now dating for money, and the man she is currently seeing is a jerk who hangs out with someone who we heard say the N word and talk about how much he hates gay people in the span of only 20 minutes. I’ve talked to my mom about it but she doesn’t seem to feel that there is any real issue. I got married a few months ago, which is a bright spot of course, but I’ve just been feeling like it’s really hard to connect with my biological family now because of all of the issues I’ve had with all of them. I used to be so close to my family, but now everything is different and I feel like I’ve lost them. On top of that, I’ve been having really severe anxiety about the political situation. Im scared to death of Trump, especially after what happened post-election (I.e., trying to get the results overturned). I’m in this state of feeling like there’s approaching storm clouds in the distance and it’s filling me with a lot of dread.

Anxiety,"Its become a real problem for me lately. I think constantly, feverishly, often whenever I get home after class I lay in my bed and my brain gets crowded with thoughts. All the things I have to do, why do I do this? why are things this way? whats the best way to do this? why am I wrong? etcetera.  feel detached from life and myself. I think it’s stemmed from my obsession with music. I want to be a good musician, make fantastic soundscapes. However I constantly feel like I NEED to be the best at it, and everything im doing that isn’t music is a waste of time. However when I AM practicing, I often noodle around, play stuff im used to, and get nowhere. This applies to pretty much everything else. Its self sabotage.  my biggest problem and reason for writing this is my over dependency on google and using the internet to answer every problem and worry I have. I google stuff like: how to get past writers block, how to make good music, why am I so apathetic, why cant I get out of bed, how do artists think, how should I handle X situation, etcetera. Basically the exact worries in my head, I google, just to feel like im solving it.  it never solves anything. And ive spent way too long on webmd and psychology today, every answer and top 5 list is the exact same, I read it all in the same voice, its the same canned meaningless mumbo jumbo that I cant even digest anymore.  problem is I dont know how to stop. Obviously: stop. But what then?? How do people solve problems in their lives? How do people make any decision on their own that isnt based on logic like math equations? feel like I cant be sure of anything anymore.

Anxiety,"Hi everyone, this is my first time posting here. I have had an anxiety disorder since I was a preteen, and have gone through many different stages of difficulty and recovery. For a few years I was doing really great, working with a therapist and developing coping skills to help my anxiety and depression, but recently things have taken a dive and now it feels like it's worse than it's ever been. I'm on a waiting list to see a psychiatrist about possible OCD, which I think has exacerbated things. Along with some embarrassing stuff I don't want to get into, it's made it so I can't eat in public, or anywhere but my own home. one of my new fun symptoms seems to be waking up several times a night in a panic. I have absolutely no idea why. I'm not having nightmares that I can recall. Nothing in my sleep routine has changed recently. I'm not on any new medications. I have enough trouble sleeping and this new constant disruption isn't helping things. :( wondering if anyone else experiences this, and if so, if anyone has any tips for how to maybe prevent this. Again, I'm waiting to get an appointment with a psychiatrist but who knows how long that's going to take. I do have an Ativan prescription (0.5mg sublingual) to take as needed but I try really hard not to take it because I'm afraid of addiction. It also doesn't last very long so I'm not even sure if taking it before bed would have any long term effect.Waking up several times a night having mini panic attacks",1634851618,1478,272

It really affects me when my partner has his friends over, who are also my friends but they’re closer with him. few years back, I started to have panic attacks when his friends came over. I felt so trapped, and even though I was in my room and they were in the other room, I got all that chest pain, crying/hyperventilating, the whole 9 yards. Finally I was able to get myself to the leave the apartment to get away. That helped, but then I felt the same anxiety when I realized at some point I’d have to go home. This whole cycle has occurred numerous times since, and my partner now knows about it. But the problem is it’s so limiting for him in terms of not having friends over.  Not a problem when he can go over to his friends, but huge problem if friends want to visit from out of town.  mostly understanding, but also has never had significant anxiety or panic attacks, so to him, he feels like if he makes this one sacrifice then it’s easy for me to make my sacrifice.

Anxiety,"Crosspost from r/therapy because I am not sure who can give the best advice on this topic! I am excited and a bit nervous to start seeing a new therapist for the first time since 2019. This will be my fourth therapist since 2012 due to moving several times, so I am familiar with the process, but want to avoid some of the mistakes I've made in the past.  have quite an extensive mental health history including, anxiety, depression, various eating disorders, OCD, and possible ADHD. With past therapists, once I get past the general introduction of my diagnoses, I break down in tears which do not stop throughout the duration of the session and take a significant amount of time to calm myself down after. I understand it's relatively normal to become emotional in therapy-- but this was very extreme and really hindered my progress!  my last two therapists, this breakdown began about 5 minutes into every single session, and lasted throughout its duration for more than 6 months. Although my therapists have been incredibly understanding and supportive, as you can imagine, it's absolutely exhausting and resulted in my dreading appointments as they typically left me feeling drained and embarrassed and more or less ruined the remainder of my day. In fact, my last therapist even choked up once and quietly said ""I'm sorry I wish I could help you more with this"".  want to discuss deeper issues, get to the root of problems, and be able to put in some serious work on my mental health, but this is incredibly difficult to do when I am basically just short of a panic attack and sobbing through each and every session.  How can I disclose this to my new therapist and ask them to ""take it slow"" so I can unpack things bit my bit without having to essentially have a panic attack at them for an hour and then spend an entire evening recovering.

I stated my cause for unemployment to be health conditions and during the past two months I had not been receiving any unemployment pay. Finally today I had an interview to determine eligibility and they basically disqualified me because I had a health condition “preventing” me from work.  They said that for me to have been eligible I had to be available for work. I told them I was actively looking for a job. But they said due to my condition I wasn’t able to work. They said instead of filing for UI I had to file for disability insurance. I didn’t know but the whole interview this man just sounded mean. I even cried during the interview at how horrible I felt that I was not gona get any help. I haven’t gone to see a doctor because I didn’t have health insurance due to me being unemployed. This man made it seem like it was easy for me to go see a doctor at urgent care and ask them for a letter for disability. I just felt awful because I did go to urgent care due to my symptoms but I never thought of asking them for a disability letter.

Anxiety,"o I'm on my last year of high school , and from 3rd grade I've been dreaming of studying abroad,  the whole process of studying abroad with all the applications , counselling offices etc. is going great.But I'm maybe in the most renowned school of my city.And there is this guy , this student , I know him too , we talked a lot of times , and have been into the same competitions together.He is known as the best student in the whole school , he gets straight A's.And I thought the he didn't want to study abroad,  that he wanted to lay in the national uni's for a while and then go abroad.But I found that he is actually going to study abroad , and it will be really easy for him , because he is just the best student in the whole school.And when people come to me and tell me they want to study abroad , there is this feeling inside of me , that I'm being attacked , that they will come and steal my place on one of the universities , even if we're going to study in different countries and different programs , I get anxious and say to myself that I just wont get in , and everyone else will , and also get quite angry because , it was not their dream to do that , it was my dream , why are they doing it , I know this sound a bit childish I tend not to think like that. when I found out earlier today that he is actually in fact going to study abroad , I was furious , anxious , attacked , and like every minute of the day , thinking inside my head , making plans.And from out of nowhere , I thought to myself that I have to become competitive,  I have to the best if not in school , at least in my classroom.And be present at all times , more then I am right now.For the first time , I just got really competitive , and can't wait to go to school ,and prove myself.

Anxiety,"Over this path month I have healed so much!! Every couple days my anxiety would switch forms, it would go from worrying about my appearance for 3-4 days, then switch to something random like school or my gf I feel much less anxious and happier. However, over the past 2 weeks I can never stop thinking and worrying about how I’m feeling in a certain moment. I’ll be doing something then I will think “am I feeling anxious today?” “Is today a good or bad day?”  if it is a bad day I start worrying about why it’s a bad day and I can’t focus on anything other than trying to make it better it is a good day, all I can think about is not screwing it up, until I eventually do and it goes back to being a not so good day if this is connected in any way, but I recently have felt like I am dealing with disassociation and depersonalization, and maybe even starting to get depressed can i change my thought pattern?My only anxiety….

Anxiety,"Hello everyone,  am someone with anxiety and depression that tends to overthink a lot and I have trouble with confrontational situations. Currently, I work Fridays and weekends at a retail job at a hardware store. You would think that, after more than a year of working there I would feel comfortable there, but I don't. I still feel as though I am incapable of helping customers who need advice, and on top of that my manager and coworkers can be very rude and hurtful. They play it off as just playing around, but it can be some pretty brutal teasing. For instance, a few months ago, I accidentally dropped a quart of paint and we were stuck cleaning it up for a while. My manager made fun of me for it in a teasing way for a few days, which was fine, I could handle that. However, he started telling everyone what had happened and they all joined in on teasing me. It's one thing if it had only been a few days, but it's been MONTH and they are still bringing it up. For example, if I am standing at the paint counter my boss will say ""You're making me nervous being over there"". Even new hires who weren't there for the incident, my manager will tell them what happened and basically encourage them to tease me about it. I expressed how bad I felt after the incident and that I really don't find the jokes funny anymore, but of course, this isn't enough to deter them. This is just one example of what happens every day, not only to me but some of my other coworkers as well.  wanted to quit this job for a while now. However, I'm not sure where to start. I currently am in college and I have a separate job which is a paid internship through my school. o I don't really need another job, but it certainly helps, and my internship only goes through December. I can always find another job, I suppose, but I fear that I might have trouble finding someplace to work for only 3 days a week. Aside from that, I've been at this store for over a year and at the moment we are extremely short staffed. My manager knows this and has been asking when I will be available to start working more hours. I absolutely don't want to as I go back tomorrow and I am dreading it. Even though I know that the wellbeing of the store isn't my responsibility, I will still feel guilty if I quit.  from that, I am also just way too anxious to quit. I've thought about a few options. I could potentially just wait it out, and start looking for another job once the semester ends and my availability opens up again. I have also considered writing a note to my boss and simply leaving it in his mailbox on a day that he isn't in. And, both of these options may sound bad to some, but I have considered just not showing up and blocking the store's number. Or alternativity, making up some lie or excuse, like I'm moving, etc. I know that those are not ideal solutions, but I am so anxious to quit that I briefly consider them. anyone been in a similar situation, where you had to quit a job with anxiety? Especially if they were short staffed. I know the best thing to do is just sit down with my boss, but I'm afraid to. Does anyone have any tips they can share of how they handled it? I realize I may also be overthinking this, so any advice that can help put things into perspective is also appreciated.  you so much for reading.Quitting a job with anxiety?",1634836957,3337,635

Anxiety," o, I’ve recently started dating a girl who I think is really great, kind, funny, very similar personalities and that is going great, we talk to each other a good amount and are able to communicate about things in a way that validates the others feelings. has done absolutely nothing to break my trust or to even make me feel sketched out, I’d say the opposite, out of anyone I have dated she has been the easiest to trust and make me feel comfortable. here comes my issue, I have issues trusting people which manifests into relationship anxiety, I find it very hard to believe that someone actually wants to be there for me, and is not lying to me/ seeing other men behind my back. I have been in therapy for a good 12 years working on problems like this, but this issue is always one that has stuck. I know why I have this issue too, it stems from some severe bullying that I went through from the age of 4 – 15. Where I had “friends” and teachers tell me I could trust them but in reality, they did some awful things to me. Being cheated on and having dealt with some serious lying in my romantic past has not helped either. extends into relationships I have now where I have a hard time believing that people are not out to get me or hurt me or are not lying to me. I hate feeling this way, I want to change but I don’t know how. A lot of advice I get is “just decide to trust them” but I feel like that is little help when I’m in my head spiraling out of control. really like this girl and would like to solve these issues so they don’t cause strain on the relationship. If anyone used to be the way I was and now was able to change, how did you do it? It seems impossible. would like to overcome my personal trust issues so I don’t wreck my relationship, what are strategies that can help?What are actual strategies to overcoming trust issues and relationship anxiety (fear they will leave me) 21m dating 21f",1634835767,1914,368
Anxiety,"o I’ve been suffering with anxiety for about 3 years now and boy has it been a hell of a ride. beginning of my anxiety manifested itself physically. I would be nauseous almost every day, and I would become anxious about the nausea as it felt like I wasn’t in control. I saw multiple gastroenterologist’s, had an endoscopy, took multiple acid control predications, and nothing was working.  about a year of struggling to find out what was wrong, someone suggested that it’s maybe anxiety. I didn’t believe it at first because It was just so physical i thought physically something had to be wrong with me. However, I still went to a therapist. therapist did diagnose me with anxiety, and suggested I go on an antidepressant. My psychiatrist put me on mirtazapine, as that blocks the ability for one to get nauseous, so my physical symptoms would stop.  worked great and i’ve been on it for a year!! returning back to in person school has created a whole new challenge for me. I’m anxious every day and get extremely close to a panic attack about once every 2 weeks. It always happens while i’m in school, when i’m home i’m fine. I talked to my therapist and we’ve been trying to work it out, some weeks are great weeks with 0 anxiety and i feel like i’ve conquered it all, and then a day like today where i was just inches away from a panic attack.  anxiety has fully shifted into mental manifestation. I don’t get nauseous anymore or anything but i’m so  of being anxious. my anxiety is, is hoping i don’t get too anxious and have a panic attack. I feel like I worked so hard to overcome my physical anxiety but now i’m struggling hard with it mentally. anyone else gone through this? Any tips or advice?

It smells weird in here and we don't feel comfortable here.  for the health anxiety part, sleeping on a couch for 2 weeks before going back to my room, caused me to have bad neck soreness/pain and caused me to constantly want to crack my neck, then tension headaches soon followed.  day (on my bday actually), I moved my neck and it felt really weird. It was the first time that I felt like I was having an anxiety attack for sure. I went to the ER, I told them my symptoms(clammy hands, tingling in my feet, tension headaches, neck soreness/pain). They told me it's anxiety attack but they ran a CT scan for my headaches.  found a small calcification in my brain (hardening of brain) and it could be meningioma. I know that most of these are benign, and don't cause issues unless it gets big enough to put pressure on the skull or brain. But some of the symptoms are similar to anxiety symptoms. know my health isn't at risk right now. But this constant thought of something in my brain keeps ruining my day. My doctor reassured me that I'll be fine. he told me that the neurologist just wants to look at it to see if I need any treatment or surgery or just close monitoring.

Anxiety,"Hey folks, up, I was known for being a really happy and social kid. I had a pretty good social life up until the end of 9th grade.  grade was the same year my parents announced they were getting a divorce. Just a year earlier, 8th grade, was when I came to terms with some really traumatic stuff that happened to me when I was 5 years old that my parents never really did anything about. stress from my parents’ messy, messy divorce and their inability to really help me process what had happened when I was younger slowly imploded my social life. I went from doing something every weekend with friends to playing video games, smoking weed, and crying in bed while contemplating suicide. inability to pull myself together kind of spilled over into college. I was good at making friends, but I was a loose cannon (drinking till I blacked out, doing dumb belligerent shit, bitching out friends over nothing, etc). It burned lots of bridges over 4 years. life is going better. I have a well-paying job in a city far, far away from home that I’ll be moving to soon (I’ve been working remotely for about a year), I have a long-term girlfriend who I love very much, and I haven’t had any suicidal thoughts in a long time.  I struggle with strong feelings of resentment towards my parents and family and I still have lots of residual social anxiety from everything that’s happened. Every time I try to bring up my traumas for closure, they always wave it off, saying “I get that it sucked but it’s in the past”. My dad had a father who told him the same thing, and he grew up in a rough country. I want to hate him for leaving me in the dust, but he’s only applying all that he’s learned.  I feel like I was robbed of my adolescence, and by extension, a proper college experience. And there’s a very clear line of when I had a stable social life before and after the onset of the divorce. My parents try so hard to love me, they really do, but they’re just from a different time. They fall very short of what I needed from them. The irony is that I’m the baby of 4 kids, and my much older sibs (they were all already moved out pre-divorce) have joked about me being shown more attention than the three of them combined.  can I work to resolve my feelings of resentment towards them? How do I exercise compassion from them while accepting the fact that they were the direct cause of the strong social anxiety I developed and still struggle with today (although the pandemic has definitely played a big part).  for any advice.

Anxiety,First of all i was looking at a guy that was getting their hair cut a few feet away from me whilst i was getting mine done and when i looked away from him they dropped his chair and it made me jump. After that the guy who was cutting my hair who was Turkish and couldn’t really speak English asked if i am ok and that my head is really hot. Instantly it made me panic and started to get really anxious like there was something up with me because he started talking to his mate in Turkish and looking at me same time which made me panic even more. I felt fine but him asking if i am ok triggered me for some reason. I tested my temp and it’s fine and no idea why i jumped maybe it was him dripping his chair that i didn’t expect or i am just tired. It wasn’t like someone was scaring me or making me jump on purpose. I do suffer with health anxiety and stress and hopefully the meds i am taking start helping me soon.

Anxiety,"Hello everyone! I was hoping for some insight if it's not too much trouble. I had (what a doctor believed) to be my first panic attack on Tuesday. We were driving home to NY from TN. At first I thought I was simply experiencing car-sickness when I asked my friend to pull off on the next exit so I could try taking over driving responsibilities to curb my nausea and stomach pain. When we got on the exit I began to experience trouble breathing. Before I know it, my breathing became extremely shallow, my face turned numb, I was having chest tightness, and I had the feeling of what I can only describe as ginger ale in my head. I begged my friend to call an ambulance and by the time there got there I was so tensed up that my speech became slurred, my sight was shaky, my eyes were drooping, and my arms and hands became uncontrollably tight to my chest and clenched to the point that I could not move them (or it would be very painful to do so).  the ER they seemed so nonchalant while I was under the impression that I was dying. My family has a long history of heart attack and stoke complications, so these are the things that I was concerned about having. I could comprehend everything that was going on but I physically couldn't control my hands, feet, or face. The Doctor explained that my heart was fine and I was too alert to seem to be having a stroke. They hooked me up to an IV and gave me a dose of Ativan to relax. 15 minutes later or so and I was completely back to normal (just so confused). have a history of acute anxiety and am diagnosed Bi-Polar, but I have (naively) always considered panic attacks to be just a person going through an extremely stressful period of time or being dramatic. ince Tuesday, I cannot stop thinking about how scary that moment was and how I never want to experience it ever again. I've been asking around to friends and family and have yet to find anyone who has experienced the same type of symptoms in relation to a panic attack (lose of control of hands and feeling of dying). Ultimately, I feel like most people I've talked to about it (including the nurses) had the thought that I'm exaggerating.  anybody ever experienced these types of symptoms during a panic attack?

The main problem is the fact that we are living in the same dorm! o, I am seeing him every day. We have a lot of common friends here, also, which makes everything harder.  am feeling so anxious when I\`m in the dorm, knowing he is 5 meters from me, or he is in the room right next to me.  of this drives me crazy. I can\`t study, I can\`t relax and enjoy my last year here.  &lt;3SOO ANXIOUS",1634829926,684,137
Anxiety,"Hi everyone, 21 M here. I’m not sure if this is the right place to post but I couldn’t find anywhere better. o recently I've shifted to a newly rented apartment near my university which is pretty busy and loud 24x7. I’ve insomnia and anxiety and even the slightest sound wakes me up in the night and my anxiety doesn’t allow me to fall asleep again. I just can’t function with less than 7 hours of sleep. My body feels fatigued, my eyes feel tired and my brain just doesn’t function properly which is clearly affecting my studies. o, I’m looking for noise blocking options but can’t find any effective ones. tried wearing earbuds/earphones but those are not at all comfortable for me as I’m a side sleeper. I’ve noticed the sound of a fan does help to block outside noise a little bit but that’s not an option for winters. I’ve also tried to play static noise in a home theater, idk why but my neighbors had complained about it. Also as it is a rented apartment there is no way to do any physical modification to the house or change the house as I have got a contract for a year. this point, I’m really feeling hopeless and I just want to sleep peacefully once. If anyone could help me with any suggestions/tips it’d really helpful. I’ve consulted a therapist for my anxiety and insomnia and everything was pretty much in control before this shifting and she had advised me to sleep in a peaceful environment to overcome my insomnia otherwise I have to take sleeping pills which is really not a good option considering I’m very young and I don’t wanna be dependent on them for the rest of my life.How to deal with insomnia in a busy and noisy neighborhood?",1634829923,1656,304

When we hit teenage years things changed but I still didn’t mind but recently they’ve all been really toxic and it’s literally the source of my anxiety and social anxiety.

They make me feel so depressed and have worsened my social skills.

Anxiety," I'm a student who works with a national organization, which has college chapters in many schools across the country. I did a one year research position and produced a report on an issue I really care about. The report is about to get published on the national website, and one of the employees of the national organization told us there's going to be a lot of publicity for our articles. it's going to be put on the national org's social media (Insta/Facebook) and also there's going to be a push to all the different college chapters around the nation (which each have a lot of members).  national insta/facebook is fine... I mean there are like maybe 600 followers on the Insta at most and a like 20 likes per post. For some reason, I feel really uncomfortable with the idea of there being a push to each and every college chapter across the nation. Maybe it's just imposter syndrome or a feeling like my privacy is in some way invaded, but I just feel uncomfortable with the idea of that many people seeing my name in their inboxes with my article. Like once it's sent to these college chapters, it would go through their notification things for the chapter. The other thing that's kind of freaking me out is that the president of the chapter at my college kind of scares me. It always feels like whenever I'm around her, she's like turning her head and staring and trying to look at me.... I feel judged. Idk I feel uneasy I'm not sure what to say or do... on one hand, i chose to get involved with this research position, knowing there was a publication involved at the end. but on the other hand, i wasn't expecting that the social media push following this publication would be so huge. i'm a very anxious person and definitely worry about other people even perceiving me, so having it publicized that much after publication is causing me stress. i'm not sure what to do... am i being irrational or should i just tell the employee that i'd prefer for my article to only be shared on the national insta/facebook rather than to every single college chapter? pls helpShould I say something about my work being publicized to certain audiences?",1634829635,2147,386
Anxiety,"When I was a kid I used to be terrified about going to sleep because I would get nightmares a lot which is common for a kid and I grew out of it. now as an adult I still get them frequently and not occasionally like normal people. ometimes the dream isn’t vivid and I don’t have much of a reaction when waking up and forget about it quickly. But a lot of the time these dreams are fucking terrible. The nightmares are always so trippy like a bad acid trip. They always revolve around a horrible death about to happen to me or it’s a horrible death in front of me of my family members. They also consist of some of my worst fears like having seizures, being paralyzed, drowning etc. I wake up hyperventilating and sometimes unsure if I’m still dreaming or not which leads to a panic attack. My dad died when I was 13 and I’ve had several fucked up dreams about him and about seeing bad things happen to him. Those are the types of dreams my brain never lets me forget.  do you deal with this? I feel like there’s no escape… my brain fucking hates me. I know to avoid certain types of food before sleep and know to avoid melatonin.

Anxiety,"Hi Everyone, just need help on understanding what in the world is happening with me. I have been dealing with anxiety and depression for virtually my entire adult life (29 now). Always struggled most with obsessive thinking and intruding thoughts, mostly around things that will never happen but are based off losing control. Think things like hurting people, crashing car, etc. this has gotten to the point where every waking minute is obsessing over things, I go from one thing to the next and cant focus on any task at hand or think of anything outside of the obsession at the time. I am so on edge and so upset with where I am mentally and feel like I really have no way out, this is the first time in my life I have truly felt like I have no way out and I am just scared. I have always had hope and good time but right now I have nothing. I am feeling extremely distant from almost anything and everything in my life. I feel out of body experiences, I am struggling to recognize myself and others, constant existential thoughts. I feel like I am an animation and just cant seem to understand absolutely anything.  question is what in the world is happening to me? How can I fix this? I genuinely feel like I am losing my mind and I have been in panic mode for the better part of a month straight. Firstly, does anyone have advice for obsessive thinking and how to deal with it? econdly, am I just experiencing dissociative feelings from the anxiety or is this something more deeply routed? Any advice or even just people who can help me understand what's happening would be so appreciated.Just need advice",1634829330,1610,295

Anxiety,"Hi, question for you all.  I was recently prescribed .5mg lorazepam for anxiety as needed and to help sleep.  My anxiety seems to be coming under control, but my sleep is still pretty messed up.  o, anyway, I take .5mg around 8pm at night, and by 10pm or so I'm tired enough that I can usually fall asleep within a half hour of lying down in bed.  I've noticed, though, that the the next day around 9am or so that I start to feel randomly anxious.  Has anyone experienced this ?  I have never taken more than .5mg in any given day, and I've only been taking it for maybe two weeks, sporadically.  I'm going to check in with the Dr. about it at some point -- it isn't a major issue -- it's just something odd that I noticed and wanted to see if others had had it.  I know it's a super low dose and I'm kind of a wuss about medications, but was still curious. don't drink, but it kind of reminds me of when I'd have like 2-3 glasses of wine some nights, feel great, get a good night's sleep, and then around 9am or 10am the next I'd just feel like anxious as hell for no reason.   in advance.Question about lorazepam aftereffects",1634824718,1127,217
Anxiety,"I (22f) been suffering health anxiety very intensely for the last four years. It started when my cousin passed unexpectedly and I’ve been in and out of therapy, upped my anti anxiety medication, etc.  this time, I’ve been seeing the same GP who has been nothing short of incredible. He takes the time to listen to me, he has (literally) held my hand as I’ve cried and he has given me nothing but reassurance. o much so that he allows me special privilege to not make an appointment and just walk in when I feel I need him.  Monday I had a panic attack, I think, but it felt odd. I nearly fell off my chair at work and blood rushed through me. I called my clinic, asked if I could speak to my doctor, but he wasn’t in until Thursday (today). Okay, no worries… I’ll wait. And honestly, I work in a hospital, if anything were to happen I keep faith in the fact the medical crash team would be at my side in &gt;10 seconds.  calls me today and I explain the situation. Note, for the last 8 months I have had a fixation on my lungs. I always think they’re failing, or that I have COPD or lung cancer. He doesn’t say anything, he just sighs. And then says he thinks the next step for me is the psych ward, or to see a psychiatrist. o I chose the psychiatrist. He then proceeds to tell me I’m out of his hands now and he can no longer help me. I’m left stunned and I feel so stupid.  understand the fact that he can not treat me medically for anxiety, he is a GP. But I feel so stupid and so… hurt? that someone I trusted so deeply with the scariest part of my life sees this as a problem greater than what he can handle. I don’t expect him to be there for me every minute of everyday, but I found comfort and ease with him.  understand how it may sound. But I feel like my health anxiety is so out of control that I am literally, for lack of better words, insane or treading on borderline paranoia. I had a breakdown to my partner tonight, and she said I am overreacting in so many words, and she’s right. But I feel like I am much more mentally ill than I thought I was.  anyone relate?

I don't get that? My thoughts are never racing, my mind is mostly empty 99% of the time. I don't know why or what makes me ""anxious"" sometimes. only ever had one person (my most recent therapist) seem to understand this. We went through a list of situations where I'll have anxiety attacks (that's mostly how it manifests for me) and even though all of it was social, alot of it just didn't connect.

Haven't done that in a long time.    24, so I think I would experience a lot of social stigma if I were to need a hearing aid. :( I don't think people are really all that accepting when they see someone so young wearing a hearing aid. I think I might need one, though, because of the period where I listened to music loudly.    REALLY regret doing that. As I've said, I've limited the max volume, but I think it's too late at this point and that's made me feel terrible.   can still hear things like birds chirping and other soft sounds but that doesn't help calm the anxiety.

Anxiety,"o I've been struggling with what everyone says is bad anxiety for 6 months or so. I've had lots of blood work, heart tests, brain scans, etc. that all have come back normal.  question is, how can I TRULY accept that the symptoms I feel are just anxiety? Most of my symptoms are physical (feeling spacy, off balance, tremors, fast heart rate, hot sensations in my head, depersonalization, trouble processing information, etc.) so I'm sure you can imagine my concern with it not being anxiety.  feel like if I could truly accept that somehow then I'd do much better.Can't accept it",1634821478,579,101
Anxiety,"There was a time when I was here searching for answers to what was wrong with me.. Perhaps my story can help someone else. I am 30. should probably say that it took me a LONG time to accept that what was happening to me was anxiety because I deal with stress quite well and didn't feel like I was an anxious person.  suffered with physical symptoms of anxiety for roughly a year. It pretty much hit me out of nowhere (or so I thought) and the symptoms were so debilitating and affected my life and work very much. I honestly thought there was something seriously wrong with me. Nausea and dizziness.. for months! Weird heart rhythms, tingling in hands, stomache and feet. This landed me in A/E two times where they have carried out blood work and various tests (EKG, heart echo, CT scan etc). None of the tests picked anything up. I had a few episodes of what I can only describe as panic attacks. Chest tightness and dyspnea. Dyspnea was absolutely horrible! Feeling that something is wrong. That's the only way I can describe it because it genuinely is just that - a feeling. It massively amplified when I went to bed. For months I struggled with falling asleep because I constantly felt like my heart was beating out of chest, I struggled to breath etc. I went through a period of stomache issues with stomache pains, dodgy stools etc (which probably added to my anxiety) Jaw tightness/clenching. I think this is how you really know that this is anxiety - if you start picking up that you clench your jaw a lot. There were times when I would get startled by random things. By startled I mean that my heart rate would spike like crazy and I would be at high alert because of some random noise. This would sometimes happen to me at night - so some noise would wake me up and I would be on high alert. Irritability at innocent things. I think unless you have felt irritability caused by anxiety you wouldn't understand what it is. Because it is not the same as annoyance. It is almost like a physical feeling. Headaches. I have had headaches for over 10 years. I always thought - that's just how I am and treated them with paracetamol. is probably stuff that I have missed but let me tell you I thought this would never get better.. Here I am 1 year later with no to little symptoms. I am not healed yet but I am working on it. What worked for me: Propranolol - 40mg a day. This reduces physical symptoms and makes them manageable.2. Acceptance. I have anxiety. Once I have accepted it - I think it removed elements of health anxiety.3. Watching what I put into my body. I think what finally healed me is I have completed cut out caffeine. I suspect through years of drinking coffee I have managed to aquire some sort of caffeine intolerance. I have also reduced the amount of chocolate that I eat and alcohol as well as other anxiety trigger foods. amazing thing is that the headaches I have suffered with for years and years are gone. I used to consume so much paracetamol - I can't remember the last time I have been to the phamarcy to buy it.Physical anxiety - how it got better for me",1634820549,3089,572

Anxiety,"orry if this is long. o, my (27F) maternal grandmother passed away a few weeks ago. he and I were close when I was young, but over the last decade I stopped going to see her because it started to bother me how racist she was, and she was homophobic so I felt like I couldn't really be my very gay self around her. Anyway, the only funerals I have been to were not normal, old-age death funerals. They have all been horribly tragic: my little sister's 8 year old best friend who died in his sleep, my close friend who died in a rollover accident, and then my ex's uncle who had aggressive brain cancer. All of them have been gut wrenching, horrible deaths. This one...this is just a very old person who lived her life. And she wasn't even a very good person in my opinion.  I am very anxious about the funeral. I hate death-related things because of the other ones I've been to and my stomach has been in knots since before she died because I knew I would have to attend this. And now it's coming, it's on Tuesday. My girlfriend has very severe anxiety around being in public around a lot of people. he told me up front she wanted to be able to be there for me for the funeral, but didn't think she could manage her anxiety enough to be of any comfort. I totally understand and I was more nervous knowing she wouldn't be there, but my younger sister (22F)  is flying in from where she lives to attend and I figured she probably wouldn't be bringing her girlfriend with her, so I would pair up with her and would be okay.  morning I found out that she *is* bringing her girlfriend. My older brother will have his wife with him. And I told my own girlfriend I feel so much more anxious knowing that I will be the only one of my siblings there without my significant other. And she said she would try to go with me but would have to take her emergency anxiety medication just to make sure she could get through it. I was so relieved and thankful. And then, after she left for work, she texted me saying she really didn't think she could go and that I would be better alone there, not worrying about if she's okay during the funeral. I know she wouldn't be avoiding doing this if she really didn't think she could...but I feel like I can't do this alone either and yet I still have to do it. I don't want to force her to go. he would never do that to me. I don't even know what I'm writing this for, I just needed to let it out.

Anxiety,"I have been sufforing from anxiety since I was little, I showed many signs of phobias when I was 3 years old, I was afraid of the sea and swimming in general, of animals and once was even scared of ridding elevators because I feared they would fall. When I got into my teens, my social anxiety started showing itself, its increase also has to do with my increase usage of pornography but even without it, I still was socially anxious. I had headaches everyday for weeks on end and had to go to a therapist, I would take Clobazam everyday so the headaches would stop and before social situations, I would take valium. As I grew older, into my later teens, I found that alcohol and food was a great escape from anxiety during social situations. If you are on a dinner and you are always eating, people won't talk to you and the alcohol would give you a nice buzz that would make you more relaxed. my highschool days, it was manageable but still had panic attacks which were horrifying and last year when I got into college, anxiety got a lot worse to the point of me skipping classes because I would be afraid of the teacher talking to me, I failed many classes because of this and I did not want to go back to my therapist and pay a shit ton of money on benzodiazepines and doctor visits, money does not grow on trees and it hadn't helped me, the medication was only temporary, the real problem lied in the mindset. was tired of it and out of desperation I wanted to try LD, it has been shown to be extremely effective against people with death anxiety, general anxiety and depression. 2 weeks after taking it, people would score higher on optimism and overall had a better quality of life. I got myself some and a few days ago I took it and anxiety is basically gone. am much more confident, happy and less anxious than I was before, its not 100% cured mind you, and anxiety is important to have in controlled situations. But what I have noticed is that I can now go to classes without a problem, I do not sweat as much, I am not as self-conscious in social situations as I was before and overall my quality of life is extremely higher than what it used to be. it seems cool and it is, it was a pain in the ass to get it. It took me a few days of searching for a decent dealer, to know how to buy Monero(XMR), how to encrypt messages,etc... and had to buy an Ehrlich reagent to properly test it.

Anxiety,"Hey guys, I am an individual who struggles heavily with anxiety which has basically impacted my whole life since I was 10. It was more subtle back then but it got at its worse when I was around 14-20 and sort of stayed bad until this week. I really worked on it this year and it did improve but I'd still get horrible intrusive thoughts whenever I did anything because basically everything triggers off my anxiety. Worst of all I get horrible physical symptoms like shallow breathing and butterflies and especially a racing heart. Because I had anxiety 24/7, I had a racing heart 24/7! It really effected me so much to the point where last sunday I had a big sorrowful cry because I was just fed up with it. I was so done with it at this point, I just wanted to be able to watch and relax or play a game without going into full fledged panic or have a conversation with someone without getting anxious which would inevitably push them away. tried to figure out what the root problem was and I realised that when I got intrusive thoughts, my whole body would go into panic mode the classic racing heart, butterflies ect but thats what brought me closer to the root problem. When I would do breathing exercises which slowed down my heart, I realised I could think clearly in that moment but would quickly disappear as soon as my heart went back hence the intrusive thoughts begin again. Thats when I discovered that it must be due to my racing heart that is so used to beating fast that it almost never stops, leading me to a never ending anxiety cycle. I had tried RI's in the past but they didn't work they just made me have intense emotions such as mania and then worse sadness. Thats when I realised that I dont really think its a serotonin thing because I didn't really struggle with depression. o I then proceeded to do some research on medications I could try because I just really couldn't do this on my own at this point which is when I eventually discovered propranolol a beta blocker which is meant to slow your heart rate down and is known to help with anxiety due to this reason. I booked a GP appointment for the next day and got the prescription for slow release 80mg propranolol which meant I wouldn't have to take 3 a day I could just take one in the morning. o I took it as soon as I got it and holy shit it made a difference immediately. I did feel slightly lightheaded and had a slight headache but I couldn't worry even if I tried. I would an intrusive thought, expect my body to panic and it just didn't! Then the intrusive thought would just go away, its honestly a miracle! I have been taking it for the past 4 days now and everyday I am getting more and more better, heck I was able to watch something without getting anxiety and enjoy it! you guys get maybe more physical anxiety symptoms this could be a game changer for you. I'm not sure if it will help with those with more mental anxiety but because my mental anxiety was caused by my physical anxiety it could end up helping with that too! I really urge you guys to try this if you haven't already because its been an absolute game changer for me. I just remember crying constantly afterwards because I was so emotional. I finally felt so much more alive and connected to the world and not just stuck in my mind full of horrible thoughts. : truggled with anxiety especially the physical kind, took propranolol which cleared up physical anxiety which in turn helped my anxiety leaving me with little to no anxietyPropranolol has been a game changer and I feel mostly anxiety free!",1634811901,3558,661

Anxiety,"Hello,  Three months ago I was diagnosed with walking pneumonia at the ER. Three weeks later, after good recovery, I had a relapse. Five weeks later, I had sth like a relapse again, but this time, doctors were not able to find anything in the xray and CT that was indicating pneumonia. Only thing was that I had inflammation indicated in my blood.  then I've some sort of recovered, however I still have more or less constant chest pain regardless of movement or breathing, most days I'm short of breath also while sitting and sometimes my heart starts racing for no reason for a couple of hours. While doctors are doing a lot of tests, they're not able to find anything in my blood, lungs or heart. I have a long history of anxiety, especially I'm in fear of a chronic disease. My question is: Has someone here experienced sth comparable? Like that there has been a physical diagnosis, but in later stages your anxiety is ""mimicing"" the diagnosis/disease from beforehand?

Anxiety,"God, it feels like the perfect storm. tarted a new job a few weeks ago, REALLY struggling to work from home because I am very bad at learning from a computer and have anxiety about making phone/video calls (I actually feel more comfortable in an office where it is easier to ask for help). A few days ago I got a job offer in my dream city and in the field I am about to earn my MA in, which would be huge, but it is part-time and a 3+ hour daily commute, so I had to decline. These jobs (and especially jobs in this city in my field) are hard to come by, so I keep feeling like I made some mistake.  icing on the cake though is my gf left me. he comes from a very traditional culture and she thinks anxiety makes me ""weak."" This somehow superseded all of the talks we have had about it and the progress we were making. I'm devastated. I keep having what could maybe be described as panic attacks, and this makes it difficult to finish my school work or try to hang on to the remote position. The whole thing is a mess, and I honestly wish I could just leave the remote position without affecting my chances elsewhere, at least to have time to grieve. It's honestly just TOO MUCH. I desperately want to simplify and hopefully find a job in my dream city, but there are maybe 3 or 5 postings a week in this city or any other city I feel comfortable in. I feel like a fool for turning down a position but it's a delicate balance and I do not want to put myself in a worse situation by taking on a huge commute for a low-paying position just for the sake of living there and being in my field. Of course, my parents are also making me feel guilty for struggling with a good-paying remote position, even if it is affecting my work in school. orry for ranting.The Last Week",1634803091,1768,346
Anxiety,"I've always wondered if this is common with some people dealing with Depression and Derealization, I get these moments where this mental fog clears up, and they happen usually during showers or when I'm quietly by myself, and rarely at the movies.  like the blurriness gets lifted just for a moment, and my brain reacts by getting scared, like an ""oh shit"" moment where you realise that your emotions and mind is being muffled, and it's incredibly eerie..  fits used to happen for longer, accompanied by thoughts of dementia and other worst case scenarios, but I'm genuinely curious if anyone else gets this way, and feel scared knowing that your brain really isn't at it's full potential.

Anxiety,"Okay. I don't know where to start. I live in a neighborhood where all of the houses are connected to each other aka Row houses. They were built circa 1927-1936. Mine was built in 1934. Our house is pretty renovated I'd say. Our kitchen is modern. Our dining room is original but doesn't scream ""I have the possibility of having asbestos"" same without living room, my room all the rooms, etc. HOWEVER... the next door is being renovated. This house was built in 1929 and had original EVERYTHING. The guy who lived there before was super old. When they first went to demolish the interior, there was mold and other things which I was expecting cause the guy was old and everything was a complete mess. They finally got done with the renovations and sold the house for a shit ton of money. Two days ago, I'm sleeping and it was 8 am and I hear loud banging and drilling. I tell my mom and all we're thinking is, ""What could they possibly be doing now. They've spent a who two years on that place"". When my mom comes home she tells me she asked one of the workmen about it. He doesn't speak English very well and my mom said he said that there were asbestos sightings in the room next to mine. I immediately freaked out and spent the next three days, day and night just researching. I came across something about old 1930s bathroom tiles possibly having asbestos. These tiles were mostly 6x6, 9x9, or 12x12. Then it hit me that my bathroom is completely original. I measured my tiles and they're all 4x4 but let me tell you... It took me four hours to get the courage to walk into my bathroom just to pee. I am so scared that I could be breathing very contaminated air. I am someone who is extremely health conscious so this was completely insane for me. I am so scared and all I am doing is researching. It says if I suspect asbestos and the tiles are not disturbed then I should be okay but if the tiles are cracked, broken, or disturbed in any way, I need to get them tested. Lucky for me they are in perfect condition. My mind is racing and my heart is 10 miles a minute. JEEZ.Hyperfixation after discovery next door during renovations. (Asbestos)",1634797382,2147,400

Anxiety,"My seperation anxiety from my boyfriend has caused him to leave a job and be let go of from one in the past. He took off work for a few months a little over a year ago, but as my anxiety began to get better, we agreed he should start working again so he started a new job where he works 4-5 days a week and comes home between 2:30-3pm. It made me anxious at first but I very quickly got used to the routine and comfortable with it. I’m no longer met with anxiety when he’s at work, just bordum. However we got into a big argument a few months ago when he was drinking and speaking his mind, and he told me that he wants to be doing more with his life, working full time instead of part time and maybe going to school. It was a real wake up call for me and i’ve been 100% supportive of him ever since. I didn’t have an anxiety disorder when we first started dating, he didn’t sign up for this and it hasn’t been fair for him. He’s done everything in his power to support me these past few years and he deserves the whole world in return.He was recently offered a job where he will be working 5 days in a row, coming home at 5pm. Not at all what i’m used to, and the idea of our routine suddenly changing and him coming home later terrifies me but I encouraged him to take it. He starts in 4 days and i’m trying not to let it get to me but it’s 1am and sure enough the waterworks have come out. My biggest fear is ruining another job opportunity for him.

I’ve grown so much since then and have come so far, so i’d like to think that I will be able to handle this and i’ll quickly get used to it like I got used to his current job. are some things I can do to calm my mind? What are some things I can do for his first week of work to distract myself and pass the time? i’d like to start working, because if i’m at work it’s going to make the day go by much quicker and make me even more independent from him.

Anxiety,"Okay so I (20F) am in my sophomore year of college. I transferred from my original college out of high school to the one I’m currently at.  have a ton of anxiety and being online my entire freshman year probably didn’t help me work through any of it. o I thought it would help to transfer colleges to a bigger state school to push myself. I find that if I force myself into situations that I can eventually work through them and be okay. That was not the case. At the end of the summer when the first semester was about to start, I had constant panic attacks. I didn’t want to go and I couldn’t. In a last minute race against the clocks, I managed to get 3 of my 5 classes online and I ended up withdrawing from one just this week so I only go to one in person class. I commute about an hour and 15 to get there. I am completely against boarding in college dorms. I’d rather have my own off campus apartment where the noise and inconvenience of a dorm is at a minimum. We’ve been looking for one but all places have no availabilities.  got thinking about how I ended up in this place in my life. I’m 20 and have so many regrets due to my anxiety. There was a college that I fell in love with my senior year. I got a great academic scholarship and an athletic scholarship with the rowing team, a sport that I was involved in for four years. But I turned it all down for the most ridiculous reasons. One, as a freshman intro course you were required to take public speaking and Two, my boyfriend at the time had cousins that went there and in an attempt to control me even more he said that they would always watch me to let him know how I was doing. No thank you.  I want to transfer back there. I miss having a passion in life. Rowing was my passion. The school was the picturesque campus you’d see in movies and it is extremely small with a population of maybe 4000. Transferring again gives me so much anxiety but I do want to be happy. I’m not sure what I’ll do about housing since my opinion on that hasn’t changed. I’m also afraid I’ll be more behind in my major so I did reach out to see if they can tell me now what will transfer.

Anxiety,"It's been almost a year since I quit smoking and drinking and it's been an uphill battle ever since. I quit because it was effecting my health. I have hypertension and acute kidney failure from drinking and taking too much ibuprofen.  put myself in this situation because I've been dealing with a lot of trauma and I'm in constant pain. Drinking and smoking were the only things that have helped me stay sane over the years and now that it's no longer part of my life I can't keep it together.  I deal with debilitating anxiety. I can barely leave my house much less work. It always feels like I'm not breathing properly. My mind is always worried about having a heart attack or stroke. And because of this the simplest tasks have become extremely difficult for me. I can't work, I can barely function and if I didn't have my wife I would be done for.  been there for me through thick and thin. The worst part is I can't be the husband she deserves because of all this. I know she's tired. he's tired of seeing me suffer and more importantly my condition is sucking the life out of her because I'm always coming at her like I'm about to die.  difficult. he's seen me at my worst with this anxiety and now I'm starting to collapse and black out from these attacks. I've consulted my doctor and he's given me meds that only made it worse.  I know is I can't put my wife through this anymore. I want to tell her I love her when I'm feeling well. I'm tired of making sure it's the last thing I say to her. Because of all this I've decided to give therapy a shot. I'm starting tomorrow.

Anxiety,"I'm anxious for a lot of the day.  Like, there's usually almost always something that's stressing me out(noise, kids being rambunctious, schoolwork).  Also, interacting with others can being anxiety inducing.  I'd say this has caused others to talk to me more delicately.  It's a slight change in the tone and how they speak to me or reference me in conversation but I can feel the difference.  It can feel like they're being inauthentic.  Like, it can feel like they don't really want to talk to me but they feel obligated to because I'm fidgeting and by myself(which doesn't necessarily mean that I'm anxious or upset.)  There have been a couple people recently, though, who I've noticed have been just talking to me/about me(not, like, behind my back.  Like, if they say, ""(my name) asked about this."", or something.) in a normal tone and I cannot begin to express how happy that makes me.  It makes me feel like I'm just another person instead of the anxious person that everyone has to be careful around.  Like, even when I respond or talk in a more anxious manner(which, if I don't know them very well, can be hard to respond in any other way.), they still talk to me like I'm just another person and it makes me feel so happy.  It's the little things, I suppose.Treating Me Like A Normal Human Being",1634787783,1306,231

Anxiety,"I'm having a very difficult time. I keep thinking about my social anxiety and how it affects my life. From my experience, it comes from a lot of bad experiences, where people treat me horribly. I got bullied a lot in school to the point where I had a long period of suicide thoughts and fear of communicating with others. A lot of people bullied me and the others just laughed at me. It was and still is very painful. They made fun of my low intelligence and appearence. It was more painful to be made fun of my intelligence because I cared more about performing well at school, although I wasn't good at school. I tried to avoid people in order to avoid the possibility of being bullied. Even when good/nice people tried to talk to me, I tried to avoid them or say and do as little as possible. I felt unsafe, uncomfortable and anxious. Back then and even today, I still feel this way. Many people doesn't treat me well. It's a horrible feeling. I don't know why people treat me like this. But, This is why I struggle to talk to people. I fear/worry people will bully me just like many of my previous experiences. I don't think handle more of that.

Anxiety,It really sucks having anxiety. You know how many times I drive back home from the store because I didn’t have the guts to go inside because my anxiety gets the best of me. I try and talk myself out of it and 90% of the time I just can’t do it so I don’t even get down and just go home then telling my family I couldn’t make it in. It’s so embarrassing and I wish I could overcome it. There are also times I go to the cemetery to see my sibling and if there is people around there at other graves I will not get down what so ever and it just breaks my heart because I’m so anxious and I try everything to snap out of it but I just can’t.

I’ve gotten to the point where I can’t even take any medication without panicking and looking up the side effects. For example: I have a UTI right now and am convinced that the medicine (antibiotics) are going to send me into a psychosis or something. I also just started a new depression/anxiety medicine and was only able to take it one day because of my constant worry. I have begun to make myself physically sick, and my doctor has even done labs to confirm that I am not. I also used to be on vyvanse for my ADHD and it worked wonders but I just felt like I was going to spiral and go into a psychosis. I haven’t taken it in so long and I’m not sure what to do.

Anxiety,"I’ve known her for about a year now, we met at work when she had just started and we got along almost right away.  There were some bumps along the way (I admit that I caused) but she forgave me for them, at least I think.  Fast forward a few months later and she ends up quitting due to constant sexual harassment.  A few examples, one person asked her if she had ever been fucked while pinned against a wall and someone else just straight up tried to kiss her in the middle of the work place.  he quit 2 weeks later, this was back in April.   texted each other since then with me 90% of the time starting the conversation, there was even one time where I suggest that we get lunch and she agreed, but I told her that she had to decide the place (she’s a vegan, I’m not), that was almost two months ago, I kinda get why it would take her a while because she was working toward getting a new job, which she got, but that shouldn’t take two months.  I brought it back up again last week and she apologized and swears she didn’t forget, so I played it off by saying don’t worry I know you were busy.  Then the next day, we’re still texting and the topic of our location came up, she happens to be near where I’m currently working (I’m a delivery driver).  I decide to wait a few minutes, then she comes driving around the corner, sees me, parks, gets out, and sprints towards me giving me a big hug.  Even when we are talking she stops and says omg I have to hug you again.  This was the first time we had seen each other since April, and don’t get me wrong, it was great seeing her but at the same time I feel like I’m getting mixed messages because she does this, but doesn’t seem to want to meet up and get lunch?

It all started when I got a puppy ( which I have now rehomed ). 2 days after getting the puppy I started to experience the urge to cry for no apparent reason and overthinking everything that wasn’t even worrying me. It’s been like this since then, reminds me a lot of 6 years ago but not as bad, but still sucks to feel like this. I now have 2 children and some days are harder than others but I manage to pull through. I just miss how I felt 1 month ago completely happy all day.

Anxiety,"Firstly, I didn't know which of these things to flair as, as I feel TW, needs a hug, or venting all work.  I've been diagnosed with GAD and panic disorder from a young age, and I've been dealing with it for a long time.  I just got back from a little trip I took for my own mental health. Things were great, I was in a really good environment and I was really thriving. My first day home I was really tired, but I expected that since I had to drive quite a way. Now, suddenly, it's as if things have gone to a place that they were before the trip- really bad, heightened symptoms constantly.(which I should add is not my normal, as I'm being treated for everything. I just chalked it up to a rough patch, which is why I took the trip.)  seems to be freaking me out. I startle so easy. I've resorted to putting a night light in the corner of my room. Last night I had nightmares and this morning I was woken up by several sirens traveling by on the main road that I'm close to. I stay off of social media a lot now, but recently it's like I'm being bombarded with doomsday predictions everytime I just want to look up some news about my favorite video games. Like Google has a vendetta against me or something (which I know can't be true because it's just stupid algorithms.) all came to a head tonight. The weather seemed really odd to me. One second it was raining hard, the next second it was dry. Then because of the sunset, all the clouds made the sky look haunting. I looked out my window to see a big rainbow, so I decoded I was going to try to be positive and take a pic. I went outside, snapped a few. And then like out of a movie lightning went across the whole sky where the rainbow was, and it almost immediately disappeared. I jumped so high when it happened, and my heart starting racing. And then I got that oh so familiar thought: the world is ending. This is it, and I'm alone.  started hyperventilating and sat in a really small closet in my house, a place that I'm supposed to go if there's tornados and I can't make it to a safer location. All I had was my blanket and my phone and I sat there for what felt like forever just wheezing and trying not to make the situation any worse. At this point my brain told me that I couldn't move because someone would break in if I did (one of my worst fears). I sat in there until my mom came home from her job and called out for me.  know I'm not but I just feel so alone. It's so easy to look back in clarity and see that the thoughts are irrational but in the moment I felt so powerless. I'm crying now just reliving it in my head. I just hope that everything is worse because of the sleep deprivation from last night, but I'm so worried now that's something else is going to happen soon. It's unreasonable just to leave somewhere or take another trip. I'm sorry this has been ranty. I just feel like posting it here to people who understand a lot more than my family makes me feel a little less alone. Has anyone else felt like the world is ending lately?I'm just so scared of everything suddenly (TW for those suffering through it too)",1634782042,3099,601

Had a panic reaction, started hyperventilating, crying, almost went to the ER, called my dad hysterical to ask him what to do (I’m 30, and the cut was so minor it healed in 4 days with a band aid, although it did bleed a lot)- went to urgent care and there was an injured toddler there crying.

I cried and had a brief meltdown at the doctor’s and then was an anxious mess for a week sanitizing everything. won’t give examples for emetophobia since that makes sense to me.

I’m not sure why, because I’ve never had heart problems before, but it’s awful.I cannot go 5 minutes without thinking about my heart or checking my pulse. And because of the anxiety, it creates physical symptoms, which makes this all worse! the second I wake up in the morning it starts. of the things I do to comfort myself don’t work because it makes it worse! Like for example, I like to lay down when I’m anxious, but I can’t do that because I associate sleeping with your heart rate slowing down and so I get anxiety, and ultimately physical symptoms from that. I also listen to music while I rock back and forth (not sure why I rock but whatever) and I associate rocking back and forth with making your heart rate go up. While I’m at school it’s okay, but the second I come home it starts. I guess because at school I’m distracted, but at home I’m not so it’s worse. Not only that, but I associate being at home and having this problem so it’s worse anyway. genuinely so annoying. No matter what people tell me, I’m still convinced I have heart problems.

Anxiety,"basically my brain seriously sucks ass and I've been anxious for the better part of my life - to summarize and get the point across, I was put on fluoxetine at 6 because I was phobic as hell so yeah - and this is something I have gotten almost... used to? (lol I told a doctor ""yep, I am anxious and the sky is blue and grass is green"" the other day.)  It doesn't faze me anymore (""what?"" ""meeting diagnostic criteria for pretty much every anxiety disorder on the DM .."" )  so I guess whatever is causing me this decided that it's time to GO HARDER. plenty of years ago ( like .. 8 ? ) I had a bad dissociative episode (weird stuff happened and I may have overshared during a psychotic episode and I felt emptied of my long companion anxiety after a talk ; what followed was, essentially, the worst anxious streak of my whole life complete with peeing on the bus stop and not getting anything that was going on for a while and memory lapses and being literally unable to understand and recall written text for days and chronic paresthesias as sequelae .. ) . Doctors didn't help and I had to get out of shit on my own because I didn't want to be psychotic and disabled before even finishing college so yeah. I started just embracing my anxiety and weirdness because at least it's way better than whatever I felt ...  at least it was . I MEAN ... pandemic right? Pandemic is bad enough on its own. But pandemic when you're a brazilian girl in an essential high risk job you hate just to pay the bills, with an abusive boss, living with your only support (a family of elders ,) and the grandma who raised you passes away while you're struggling enough with ""hope to not become a germaphobe again"" ?? absolute living hell.   while I like to think and pretend I am okay - holy fucking shit I am sure I am gonna have another weird dissociative episode if things don't get better quick and it doesn't look like they will. o, question for my chronic anxious fellas - anyone ever had a bad dissociative and/or psychotic episode ? Anyone knows what I felt, even (sorry) ?  Lately I've been having migraines all day when I am outside and don't wanna leave home and my whole body aches from tension if I try to do my regular office work -  I found an insane amount of courage today to send a boss a mail asking to go on an unpaid leave because I figured it's better than just quitting or stopping going to work but .. yeah. It was insane of me. igh. Also, any neuroatypicals here ? I've been suspecting I might be untreated AD so some feedback would help ...  . Please don't tell me to go see a doctor - I have seen over 20 doctors for mental health in my life and no one really helped ; doesn't help that RIs give me bad adverse effects and I end up leaving them cold turkey in few days lol. The only med that has ever helped me is CBZ but ugh side effects  for asking so many questions kay. thanksuh, hi I may be in need of help ( 27/F )",1634779989,2928,565

Anxiety,"Hello, r/Anxiety ! This is a relatively long post so please bear with me. a month ago I broke up with a girlfriend whom I loved dearly and saw a future with. he suffers from GAD and while this didn't ""scare me off"" in and of itself, I was in the unfortunate position for months of no longer having her as a contributing partner to the relationship. Without understanding what was happening and mistaking her internal battles as a lack of commitment or care, my mental health took a toll as well. he is still in the process of accepting and understanding the role that anxiety plays in her life (in a way, the breakup became necessary for her to be able to do that without having somebody else to worry about/support). As I look back on the relationship I see how my uninformed efforts to help in particularly challenging times only made matters worse. ince breaking up I have read ""Loving omeone with Anxiety"" by Kate Thieda, and have found tremendous clarity. and I have spoken intermittently since breaking up and would both love the opportunity to try again, while also recognizing that there is much work to be done before that would be appropriate (work that would both serve as growth for each of us as individuals, and greatly minimize misunderstanding about her anxiety/not bring out nastiness in me when I ought to be supportive). I recognize that the challenges of GAD for her and for our relationship would persist into the future, and would willingly meet them head on - ideally with a version of her that has a stronger understanding of what's going on when anxiety rears its head and what to do about it. To my knowledge, she is pursuing various forms of CBT (changing therapists from one who primarily practiced AEDP, using workbooks, and becoming more informed on the subject overall), which even in this short time seems to have provided her with a deeper toolbox. I'm very happy for her and hope she continues to find some breathing room.  question, particularly for people who also suffer from GAD, is whether I have realistic /fair desires and expectations for a possible future. Have I done irreparable damage by breaking up in the first place? I'd also love to hear about any lessons learned from married couples who successfully manage to work together in facing this unique set of challenges. you!Ex girlfriend suffers from GAD - is it fair to try again in the future?",1634778189,2392,420

Anxiety,"o after 2 almost years I’m finally going on a date this weekend. I kind of just stumbled into it (she asked me out). I’m excited the woman I’m meeting seems super great but I’m feeling incredibly anxious.  have a lot in common, we're both introverts, we love animals, and have similar interests. But I can't shake this fear that my anxiety disorder will get in the way because it affects my life in a lot of ways, most notably I don't drive and have severe agoraphobia. I'm independent but I just constantly worry about that being a problem. recently found out after chatting with her she might be a bit of an adrenaline junkie, at least compared to me. he loves things like rollercoasters and rock climbing, and wants to go skydiving. I mentioned I'm not into that stuff, and she said basically ""don't try to change me and I won't try to change you"" which seems fair. But in the back of my head I'm terrified that my anxiety challenges will just be even more of a problem for someone like her. the other end though what if we do like each other and the anxiety isn't an issue for her?

Anxiety,"I’ve been diagnosed for about 4 years now and it’s been a difficult uphill battle. I’ve gone from shaking and turning red when talking to people I don’t know to being able to spontaneously converse without and anxiety. I thought majority of it was behind me as I could handle confrontation for the most part. with my country finally bringing back in person class, I’ve recently rediscovered a huge part of my anxiety I neglected. I studied hard and practiced for my presentation for my French class, but as soon as I got up I was already stumbling, trying to rush through it, turning red, and shaking like I would before when I was nervous around individual people. I understand presentations are nerve wracking for everyone but it gets almost uncontrollable for me which causes me to lose my train of thought and stumble through the words which I was able to perfectly recite the day before.  refuse to go on medication due to the side effects and withdrawals of pharmaceuticals and I just don’t feel comfortable relying on a drug. Especially for something I have controlled and conquered for the most part. question here is how can I go forward and reduce the stress that comes with presentations as I will inevitably have to do more of them.  I know exposure is one way but I don’t get much of a consistent opportunity to do so, so other ways around would be useful. over the counter medication that reduces stress for a given period in advance would be extremely helpful, if anyone could help, I would really appreciate it.Huge presentation anxiety",1634777720,1552,272

This wasn’t an entirely new experience for me, as I’ve had it in the past. I associate an inner dialogue with a great mood. is/was kind of a miracle drug for me. It all but cured my OCD. Because it destroyed the voice in me that controlled me. am currently titrating down off of my amitriptyline, in an attempt to regain some sense of self. just wondering if anyone else has experienced this...I’m a bit worried I’ll never hear or connect with myself in that way again. miss myself. I journal, but it just feels like writing words on a page. Is this what people mean when they say their medicine made them “a zombie?” the amitriptyline causing no dialogue, did the phentermine cause dialogue, what if I need a stimulant to hear or connect with myself? I just don’t want to be on anything anymore. I have so many questions. I can’t remember how I feel on nothing, honestly. coming off is the right answer, and my psychiatrist and therapist approve.

Anxiety,"I (30 M) almost 6 months ago started dating a guy (34 M) that i've since really taking a liking to. He's the second person I ever dated. Growing up I made it a habit to be used by anyone around me. This led me to avoiding relationships as I was terrified of being taken advantage of. attending therapy at 29, I decided to start dating. My first relationship turned abusive and I left.  second and current is much healthier. But im driving myself crazy with worry over something that maybe shouldn't bother me. its like this. A little while back after my fourth date with him, he told me this. ""I want you to know, that in the past I have had trouble in relationships, because I am not good at showing my emotions. And I just want you to know I'm trying"". At the time, I wasn't bothered by it, because it was early and I took it as a sign that he cared about what I thought of him. ince then things have gotten better overall between us. However there is one thing that has gotten worse.  doesnt make me feel loved, or wanted. The kind of person I am, I love to let the people I care about know that I care about them. Gifts, affirmation, spending time especially. I give that to him and then some. But in return, its almost nothing. No gifts, no time spent as he never initiates any visits or activities. But most of all, zero, and I mean zero words of affirmation.  first I didnt think anything of it. But over time, I realize what is driving me nuts is I dont know if hes happy with me. The one thing that I need in a relationship, is that mutual bond. I love being with him, but I have zero indication that feeling is shared. And it spikes me anxiety like nothing else. It leads to overthinking to the point where I convince myself that hes just with me out of pity. And it sends me into a depression.  brought that up to him once. And his response was that he is ""comfortable with me, and happy he's my boyfriend"". At first I was thrilled to hear this, as it was that affirmation I was needing. But since then things have started to feel even more distant. Things changed, like him not saying good morning, turning me down in spending time with him, just a general lack of interest in the things I say. I have asked him multiple times if things are okay, and hes said yes every time. But it just feels so cold, its eating away at me.  worst part is I cant tell if this is just, normal for some people and my anxiety is screwing with me. Or if my gut is right, and this is a problem.  the other side of things. He does do some things that make me feel better. Like being insistant in introducing me to to his friends and family, he did get me a gift for my birthday, he was there for me when I was going through a personal crisis. And when we are together, he will do things like reach for me, or scratch my head. But those things are few and far between.  would love anyones opinion or advice on this.I have been driving myself nuts in my relationship.

Like you suddenly realize you are stuck in this body and just the fact that you are existing gives you intense panic-like anxiety. It's like you became aware of your own consciousness and then the mind wants to escape from reality or ""shut itself down"" because being conscious is ""overwhelming"" for some reason. It is such a weird feeling, it drives me crazy and it has turned into a 24/7 obsession.   had this feeling before as well from time to time and it was triggered by a panic attack I believe. But now, all of a sudden, I am stuck in this ""autoloop"" where I have this hyper-awareness feeling all the time and I constantly dread my own existence. From time to time, I would also have panic attacks because of this as well. The fact that I am conscious feels weird and overwhelming for some reason. Funny thing is that I am not suicidal at all, I adore living, but I don't know how to ""make peace"" with my consciousness again.   yes, and I've been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder but I didn't start the treatment yet. I'm not sure if medications can help when you actually have this feeling about your own consciousness. I feel like I am the only one having thoughts like these and that doesn't make the condition any better :(Hyper aware of my consciousness + constantly on the edge of a panic attack",1634768518,1404,254

Anxiety,I'd waited my whole life until becoming a teen to fall in love. And it just ended up with me falling for an inanimate person that doesn't exist and is purely fictional. Don't get me wrong I'm aware of them being fictional but the thing is such rash and hard love. sucks because I was so excited to find love and the first person I ended up falling in love with was fictional. It's only enhanced my anxiety by thinking that this person that doesn't exist will be the only thing close to love I'll have.Venting about my love life.,1634767460,528,100
Anxiety,"For me it works like this: every once in a while, like every two years or so, I start experiencing a weird symptom. Not something common like a headache, but something actually odd that probably everyone would agree I should get checked up. I start worrying about it, but I'm unable to research my symptoms because that would give me an anxiety attack, so I just worry and ruminate. The symptom changes or gets worse (never disappears), and eventually I come to the conclusion that is cancer or some other deadly thing and that I'm probably going to die. I still can't bring myself to go to the doctor, not only because hospitals terrify me, but also because I don't want to be told that I'm dying. o I just live for months or even years in a state of never ending anxiety until the suffering is so strong I can't take it anymore and I have to go to the doctor. They tell me I'm fine and I get to feel relieved for a bit, until the next weird thing kicks in.  always worried excessively about this things, but this last year has been hell. I am so convinced I'm going to die this time that I can barely do anything to keep my life afloat. I find it so difficult to care about my goals and my plans like I used to because I can't see a future for myself, as I expect to be dead soon. I'm already mourning the life that I could have had, and that makes living my day to day difficult and sour. The anxiety itself is constant and debilitating, not just mental but also physical (brain fog, chest pains, dizziness, heart palpitations etc). I feel like a house with too many electric devices running, and if someone turns on a hair dryer I'll just shut down and be done for. It's been more than a year of agony this time and I will go to the doctor soon because I just can't take it anymore, but the thought alone still makes me sick because I don't want to die. I try to convince myself that I'm young and the possibility that I could develop cancer is rather slim, but my brain just doesn't CARE. There's no way it's going to be just somatic this time, and I'm just so terrified.  sorry this is so heavy, but no one in my life really takes this things seriously and I just needed somewhere to vent.

Anxiety,"This is long so please bear with me longtime 'friend' and I just signed a lease and moved into a townhome.  I'm 23 and this is my first time away from home.  I've been meaning to get out for a while, just havent found the right opportunity.  Friends would offer over the years, this one included, and I'd flirt with the idea, but back out cause of gut feelings.  I also got denied on my own cause of criminal background and no rent history.   retrospect, I dont know if it would've been impossible for me to get my own place, but it would've been a challenge.  When my friend asked me this year, my internal reaction was 'no.'  Ive even contemplated my relationship with this dude in the past but forgave him.  I thought, 'fuck it, dudes financially stable, got good credit, I need to get out on my own, i should try the roomate thing out.'  It made so much sense looking back on it but its hitting me harder than ever that I ignored my instincts and might be screwed.   trying to tough it out for now cause I dont wanna hate this experience but it's almost impossible.  The feelings of homesickness away from my mom and cat are natural but shouldn't this simultaneously feel good? Like this makes no sense when I explain it to people.  Hes not a bad guy, always pays his rent and certainly isnt violent or dangerous, but I dont like his company nearly as much as I thought I would.  Plus I dont like the place either.  It feels like a lot of this was his idea but obviously it's on me for agreeing.  I've vented to my parents about this and they keep telling me 'try it out for a month, if you cant stand it theres ways out.'  I wanna believe them and maybe they're right but this isnt a movie  I signed a lease and for now I'm stuck.  I'm not looking for a pity party but I'm in internal hell and just looking for some support or advice cause this sucks.

Anxiety,"This time, both myself and my 3-year-old brother. look at all of these rabies fear stuff (which I can't tell them to my parents because I see serious consequences!) time, we were going out and my brother ran into 2 dogs. They didn't woof or anything and I stopped my brother ONLY via command (no holding). The dogs were just passing near my brother, at least that's what I remember. ometimes, my thoughts go to a possibility of a scratch went unnoticed. But I guess if there was actually a scratch, my brother would scream or cry because of all the pain that the scratch gives. But can a scratch from a DOG not be painful or noticed AT ALL? I was further away from the dogs but I was close to my brother. Then, he held my hand, which it had some dry skin. They don't count as open wounds? OK, I tried to forget it and checked his face and hands for scratches. (rest of his body was covered in clothing), and I couldn't find a scratch on his face and his hand... well, I just saw a white mark on his wrist! I sometimes think that mark is from something else because during the event, his wrists were covered (only the hands were bare, and no scratch marks on his clothing either) and there were no scabs or broken skin, just a white mark without reddish places. But I can't forget it because it may have been a dog scratch that has went unnoticed, even by my family. I don't remember the dogs giving him physical pain or anything like that. If I can take a picture, I'll post them. today, while I was doing my homework, I felt like I was having rabies symptoms... then they went away.  don't want a rabies explosion in my family but I can't talk about it with my parents!

They grabbed me from off the couch and dragged me outside. I was trying desperately to get away. I was terrified. My friends stood around and watched. I was pinned on the ground as they wrapped the duct tape around my body, but I kept kicking my legs. One sat on my back, I struggled to breathe. I pleaded, I begged, as I gasped for breath.

They stood around and laughed. Called me a bitch, called me a pussy. I struggled and failed to get free. Finally, a girl who had been watching from the balcony took pity and told them to let me go. After what seemed like forever, they cut me free. There were no consequences for their actions, nobody cared. I had to deal with the humiliation, hopelessness, betrayal on my own.

That was really hard for me, the two biggest things that kick my anxiety into gear are angry confrontations and illegalities.   I am also thankful she felt open that she could talk to me.

They were ok with it. each day that I wasn't working, I felt guilt so strong I felt like I was suffocating, it reminded me of a traumatic situation when I was a kid and an older female relative had taken advantage of me and hiding that from my family caused similar guilt so I would get nightmares of the same things.  months later, I've given the exams and collected the paper work for the post graduate course , all of this had successfully kept the guilt at bay, but recently I applied for an interview (unwillingly) at a very prestigious place, I was fully expecting to get rejected, but I got a mail that ive been selected. this would be good, but I can't breathe. the suffocation is back and I don't know what to do.My sister is pregnant with her first child and is understandably busy, she is also sick and still working.

Anxiety,"Howdy all, just need some words of encouragement and affirmation that i'm just going through anxiety. Lately it's been somewhat controlled but the last two days have just made me feel it hard again, and when it gets going it makes me feel like i'm having a stroke or a heart attack, and makes my mind go into that spiral of what ifs, and making me listen to every little thing my body does. I know i'm not, but the feelings won't go away when i attack them with my logic. I just got done walking/jogging around my apartment complex's lake, got my heart pumping which felt good- My pulse ox before going out, and after coming back in was/is hovering around 98-99%- My blood pressure is 122/78. I do have primary hypertension, and i'm used to seeing it a little higher but i am medicated for it and take it religiously, but it is controlled.- No arm/back/neck pain anywhere other than my head, localized to a migraine style headache(which i'm going to go see an ENT next week because of constant sinus issues, which isn't helping it)- No swelling of the legs/feet/ankles- No vision abnormalities other than the damn astigmatism in my left eye- No face drooping, coordination is all good, and left side of my body feels totally in control- I do have GERD but i'm taking pantroprazole for it, but it does come up now and again.  all in my head right? Man, typing this out made me realize anxiety is a hell of a phantom to fight and it makes me look crazy.Anxiety flaring up again, could use some affirmation",1634759233,1503,274

There is not heart issues in my family. I have taken my blood pressure and it’s semi normal around 121 over 75. I’ve recently become really afraid of sudden cardiac arrest. During the summer a soccer player had collapsed on the field. Then twice in the last week. I first read of a girl who is in a lot more in shape then myself and she collapse during the Boston marathon and someone else I know collapsed at there desk at work. If someone who plays soccer and is an exper marathon runner collapses. Then there is a risk for me right?  since I knew about the girl I have felt pressure in my chest and left arm. I’m terrified that I have some type of heart issue.  parents think I am imagining the chest discomfort due to reading about the Boston marathon girl and it’s nothing. They are probably right since I’ve had no pain. But I just can’t stop thinking about it. It could come next time I run or during my marathon in a couple weeks or what not  anyone have this?

Anxiety,"Hey, all! How are you doing? Hope fine I was diagnosed with GAD around 13 years ago and apart from semi-annual panick attacks, I kinda live a normal life.  as time passes, this little thing looks like a ""pokémon"": the symptons evolve. when I was a kid, I thought the world was going to end. Felt dizzinness and lots of fear. ""Will the water end?"", sometimes I asked my dad. I went to college and it became short breath. And since then, this is it.  always took medication, mainly Fluoxetin 20mg. Around a year ago, I changed it for Venlafaxin 75 mg and got an overall gain in quality of life. Now, jump to 2 weeks ago. I forgot to take the med one day and felt really strange, like floating, but it's normal symptons of abstinence. Took the meds the next day and forgot the day after again. Then... Boom. Panic attack. this time... It was different. Instead of short breath, it was... Butterflies in the stomach. Now, I went to see my doc and he pumped it up to 150mg. 2 weeks have passed since the panic attack and 5 days now with the higher dosage. The feeling simply doesn't leave :( I already knew how to deal with the short breath, but this new ""sympton"" is so so so worst that sometimes I simply want to cry. does anyone knows if Venlafaxin 150mg takes more than 2 weeks to make effect? for reading and hope you guys have a wooooooooooonderful day &lt;3""Evolving"" symptons",1634755400,1378,256
Anxiety,"Ive dealt with depression for as long as I can remember, but not once did I ever think i had anxiety. I always have these ""epsiodes"" where my chest would randomly hurt so bad and i had trouble breathing and noticed my heart rate would go up no matter how hard i tried to calm myself down nothing made it stop. Not once did it ever occur to me it was anxiety, I have gone to the ER 3 times for it and came back with no answers except for the third time. Yesterday I was driving, singing my lungs out to Mitski as usual when suddenly I couldn’t breathe. It was so so hard to breathe I started freaking out but then decided to do breathing exercises bc I thought maybe I was singing too much. The chest pain began but this time it was worse than usual and the worst of them all my heart rate was sky rocketing. (went up to 160) I felt like I was dying. I felt helpless not being able to catch my breath and feeling the worst chest pain ever. I had to take an ambulance to the ER my parents were worried it was serious, but nope I was diagnosed with anxiety. I was told I had a panic attack and that they can happen so suddenly. I went to the doctors this morning and it was confirmed I do have anxiety, I feel so dumb for being so clueless this whole time. I would never wish a panic attack upon anyone they are absolutely horrible. What do I do when they happen out of nowhere without any trigger? i dont get it at all.

Anxiety,"I have an odd anxiety/panic attack inducing issue that no matter what keywords I use I can't seem to find any information in Google or reddit. To start, I have genral anxiety with panic attacks and depression that was diagnosed many years ago. I'm currently on a waiting list for a therapist in my area.I'm posting here as I feel completely alone with this issue and am hoping somewhere  someone knows what this is. It's a complete fear which makes me anxious leading into panic attacks from certain patterns, empty spaces or rooms, blank walls of any type or color (especially lighter colored walls), bright lights. I even have nightmares about these situations. Most people are afraid of the darks, I am the opposite. This only happens in man-made structures, not outside.I figured this might have a connection with the fear of holes like the lotus flower, but those images don't trigger me whatsoever expect being wierd (like the hand with fake holes)I have some pictures of things that have triggered a full blown out panic attack on imgur. The bathroom walls in a building I work in and Barnes and noble lead me to looking at the ground and covering the top of my eyes like I'm shielding from the sun. In the picture of the dark bathroom is has to stay dark and I cannot look up. ome other pictures are when I'm in the Oculus VR that trigger this as well.

This was way back in the earlier 2000s, way before the recession. But the strange thing was, the recession didn't come to my mind first, they happened at the same time as if there linked. Just to reiterate, they're not linked at all. happens with basically all of my memories. Basically, the memory isn't of the memory, it's tied to locations. But the location isn't relevant, it's not where I had the memory. read about associated memory, such as you smell freshly cut grass, that reminds you of being in your parents garden as a child but it's not that. not exactly anxiety related, but it does weird me out.What is this thing called that my mind does with memories?",1634752572,1011,191
Anxiety,"I've asked 2 drs (one GP, one Psych) about leave-- like FMLA -- to temporarily get away from the source (volatile coworker) of my severe resurgence of depression, anxiety, and (a new issue) insomnia. BOTH concluded something like 'you don't want unpaid leave...here take this benzo"". not anti meds, I take antidepressants and adderall for my ADHD. But I was surprised they literally both offered me (different) benzos when I said I didn't think going on MORE medication was a good long term solution for me personally. looked through this sub's past posts and a majority of the time it seems Drs seem receptive to FMLA leave when you need it due to mental health issues.  I feel like I'd be better off dead most days for a couple months now, but I'm not actively considering suicide (they both asked me if I was suicidal). I didn't want to lie and say I was suicidal. Is that the issue? it only happens if you're suicidal? at a loss what to do next.

I've spoken with it about her and she's explained it's irrational and has no basis but at the same time she can't control her it.

I'm doing my best to let her know that Im interested in her and that I'm not the type of person who will just up and leave, but as time goes on it's beginning to take its toll on me I don't know what else I can do. I've asked her if there are any triggers or things I can do to help put her mind at ease but she just says she has abandonment issues and she needs to work on it. At this point it's  here because I'm hoping I can get more insight into what having anxiety is like. I want to understand so I can help her, and help our relationship so I can better handle it for myself so it's doesn't get to be an unbearable load.  Any advice or tips on how to manage her anxiety/talk to her or what to do in general would be appreciated. Thank you for taking the time to read. Girlfriend dealing with anxiety about me leaving her, please help me understand what anxiety is like and how to manage it better.How to handle girlfriends anxiety.",1634743449,2271,429
Anxiety,"I've dealt with anxiety for some time. Usually I keep it under control. However, when it gets bad I get an extremely uncomfortable tight and tingling feeling under my sternum.  It often is the result of going several nights without much sleep.  As a result of the feeling, I often feel it hard to get much sleep the next night, staring a vicious cycle.  I've tried deep breathing, and while it does help, it doesn't get rid of it altogether. Does anyone else get this symptom? How do you deal with it?How do I get rid of the anxiety in my chest?",1634743395,545,102

Anxiety,"I don't know what else to do but post here, even knowing I most likely won't get a response.  past 2 weeks have been the WORT 2 weeks of my life. I have been on Lexparo 20mg for MANY MANY years but I have been so irresponsible about taking it the past year. Felt like I didn't need it so I was taking it so sporadically (one or twice a week for the past year). Been taking it again daily for the past week and a half or so.  past 2 weeks, I've thought I have had every condition under the sun. Been to the ER twice saying I had brain cancer (CT scans negative). Been to the ER saying I have stomach cancer (CT scans negative). ince then, I cannot stop with constant panic and worry. Waking up daily sweating and panicking. Which has led to me googling all day. ""Why can't I calm down, am I going pshychotic?"". ""Why do I wake up with random songs stuck in my head all day and getting Deja Vu, do I have epilepsy?"". It's just a constant worry about every thing under the sun. I cannot get a control of my thoughts and its causing me to not focus at work at all.  legit don't know what else to do. I have an appt with a Pschy tomorrow (after weeks of calling and begging them to get me in there). I am so scared they are going to see my condition and tell me to admit myself to a mental hospital.  want this to go away more than anything. I want my life back. I have an amazing wife and a beautiful son and I can't even be a good husband or father because all i do is pace around the house in a state of panic.  someone tell me this will go away and I can live a normal life again.

Anxiety,"Happy Monday!! o I recently took a job at a startup (going in to an office) and left WFH life at a larger company. Really kind of regretting that but that’s a diff story. I have been struggling and did at my previous job with social anxiety and perfectionism. I was in a sales role and now I do a hybrid engineering/sales role and just realize how much I seem to struggle with social anxiety and perfectionism. I kill it in my roles (usually) but I’m stressed to the max 99% of the time. I work out, eat right , and meditate. I don’t want to take medicine really. This new job basically hired me and threw me directly to the wolves with literally ZERO training too so it’s been really tough. question - how do those also with some social anxiety and GAD cope? Does this shit ever go away? I know I’m stressed bc this new job kind of sucks but I’m generally curious if I will ever beat this or maybe if there is a role I should seek to help minimize  my anxiety with my skill set. I deeply miss WFH (and my family) but I’ve only been in this role for 1 month and my pride and ego won’t let me leave I don’t think lol. It is some bullshit I got zero ZERO training though!! advice anxiety sufferers? What do you guys do for a career and do you like it?High functioning anxiety, perfectionism, and careers.

Anxiety,"Easing my way back into exercising broke my knee in July. It wasn’t too bad of a break, but enough that I wasn’t allowed back to the gym for a month. I have always had health anxiety related to my heart. It always feels like it beats way too fast. When I was 19 I was put on beta blockers by an incompetent doctor. I am now 25 working my way off beta blockers because I don’t need them. Anyways, I have been going back to the gym for 2 months now with the help of PT, but have avoided cardio. The idea of being out of shape again and my heart rate being elevated scares me so much. For the first time in 3 months I am doing the stair master (literally as I type this). My heart is racing a little because of the steady pace, but mostly because of anxiety. I am powering through it though!! Im sweating, feeling nervous yet so empowered. I have been resting my knee and taking care of it, but now I am taking care of my mind and my heart as well. I am passionate about working out, but my heart rate (which is 157bpm while working out right now) seemed to always hold me back. But here I am. I am accomplishing it and doing it healthy! Thanks for reading my victory. I hope everyone has a great day! You can do it!!I am doing it!!",1634740317,1229,246

I'm not happy about it, but I have to. And I am struggling, I feel like no one sees me, but what I said to my friend is, just take one day at a time it will end eventually.

Anxiety,"Hello. My health anxiety is out of control these days,  but I'm having a hard time knowing if it's just my anxiety or if this is the real deal this time.  am worrying about pancreatic cancer. I have some back pain that doesn't feel muscular, and I'm not sure what's causing it. I also occasionally have some upper abdominal pain, and tons of indigestion. Well, Dr. Google tells me that vague back and abdominal pain that comes and goes at first, and indigestion, can be a sign of pancreatic cancer. Well, crap. It is now all I can think about.  last night I forced myself to stop googling and try to read a new book to get my mind off of things. Maybe I didn't read the description well enough, but the main character in the book is doing freaking pancreatic cancer screening research.  I'm convinced the universe is trying to tell me something and this is the real deal this time. you are worried about a particular health issue, do you ever start seeing stuff about it everywhere you look? Like in the book you are reading? freaking out over here. I'm 38F and have 3 kids. I want to be here to see my kids grow up.Worrying about cancer. Just need to chat.",1634738613,1157,215

Before I knew this, my anxiety was at an all time high. I had my first panic attack, I was hyper focused on my breathing, daily anxiety was just atrocious. of yesterday/ Monday, I've developed a facial tic where my eyebrows raise quickly. Occasionally my chin will go up too kind of like a ""sup man"" head nod. Also, my lips/ jaw move as well. The main tic is my eyebrows. The tic is giving me even more anxiety than I had before, and I was wondering if anyone else also had sudden onset of facial tics. How do you handle them?

Anxiety,"I was in a relationship for 5-6 years and was in my mind now, emotionally abused regularly, was cheated on 5 times and ending up apologising to her for it and taking her back every time, I felt like I had to pay for everything including her loan, insurance, horse livery, and the mortgage and household bills. she eventually ran off with the guy I’d asked to be my best man, I was finally free, but I still struggled to leave, I had massive breakdowns daily, I had attempted suicide a few times and could not connect with anyone. Not for the want of trying after a few months I had tried to get back into dating but could never get a response or message back from anyone.

Anxiety,"I am so so happy! I live in a third world country, having access to vaccines is like parkour. well, after 9 months of waiting I finally got it!! I’m a minor so it took especially long to get that and A LOT of hard work. they just recently allowed it for our age group! only with comorbidities (I have allergic rhinitis) and since they take the ennoculation of minors seriously we had to do it in a hospital (absolutely perfect for my hypochondria) They took my BP, oxygen, and whatnot before and post vaccine. the doctors gave me a list of side effects to expect and when to go to the ER, I felt so reassured and safe. The side effects stories and the myocarditis definitely was in my mind, and hopefully i would be able to sleep properly tonight without freaking out about dying in my sleep but I feel like I have this weight lifted off my shoulder telling me that I don’t have to worry about covid anymore!

Anxiety,"To make a long story short, my Therapist is pregnant she said last week which I'm happy for. The issue is she wants to refer me out to a Chronic pain therapist which I don't agree with as my anxiety causes my pain (she said she would help me with anything that causes me anxiety a few months ago).  said she'll have an extended Maternity leave and doesn't know when yet she'd see patients or what capacity but ethically she has a duty to refer me to a Therapist best suited for me. I know she'd probably see less patients once reopening as now she has a child which is understandable but I was one of her first patients since licensed then once she started her own practice so it really hurts.  said once she returns her focus would be patients with diabetes not my chronic condition IB. I met her as she joined the one group in NYC that focuses on people with IB and IBD then she started her own practice. he was the first person in my life I trusted outside family and I said openly I trust her just two months ago which was a major milestone.  then I've had burning sensations and painful intense GI symptoms, trembling, loss of appetite etc.  issue is the person I would normally work with to fix this is now focused on finding me someone else and the cause of my anxiety. What do I do? How did you guys cope during Termination? My body feels like it's on fire and I've had brief trembling on and off. Also can't sleep through the night as I wakeup feeling overheated.How do you deal with Anxiety about your Therapist? Therapist Terminating.",1634735321,1545,289
