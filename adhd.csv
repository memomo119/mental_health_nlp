ADHD,"Hey friends. 25m here. Ive been recently diagnosed with adhd.  been no secret that I have it. Im very easily distracted, i have shit memory. I cant finish a task until its down to the wire and my life depends on it.. I have a hard time focusing, and unless i find something interesting I have a hard time actually retaining anything i learn. I have to fidget. Keep moving, always restless. I was a poster child for it this school and my parents just decided to ignore it &amp; not get me any help or medication. Fast forward, and as listed above  its starting to negatively affect my life so I talked to My doctor and after a half hour conversation and a couple tests(checklists) he prescribed me 30mg vyvanse. He said it should help me instantly, well. I took my first pill this morning 3hrs ago and dont feel any different. At all. Im 5'11 &amp; 290lbs.  (I drink coffee like its water, does this have any effect?) know if this Vyvanse will eventually help me? I have friends who take it recreationally and describe euphoria, better focus, all the shit that its apparently supposed to do. just want to finally be better.  yallFirst time diagnosed adhd? Vyvanse 30mg.",1635429501,1168,211
ADHD,"Hey Everyone  for the past few days I’ve been reading more and more stuff on this sub about issues that seem to affect ADHD sufferers to a greater degree than the general population.  to tell stacks of white lies, dissociating with friends and relatives, procrastinating till the night of the deadline, developing messed up sleep cycles etc.  understand that while most of these things affect the general population, in our cases it becomes pathological. Having a severe negative effect on our lives and self-image.  wanted to make a thread about what strategies you have tested and used to overcome them.  how do you sit and write three hours a day as opposed to 8 hours the night before.  was a character called Oromis in the Eragon series. They called him the Cripple He Was Whole.  somehow 12-13 years ago when I read the books, I felt a real connection to him.  had been almost destroyed in a previous battle, but had built up his strength again through a scaffolding of tiny spells and enchantments that allowed him to not just face, but even defeat some of the most powerful warriors of the land.  tell me your spells and enchantments.

ADHD,"Like the title says. I finally bit the bullet and saw a therapist and psychiatrist because I felt there were so many thing not working for me in my life. I’ve been on lexapro so long but my psychiatrist decided to try a new approach and considered adhd as my main issue and anxiety a part of that. he took me off the lexapro and put me on trattera. Within 5 days I’ve noticed huge developments in motivation towards my goals and ability to sit still and focus in. Equally, I’ve had some bad side effects. Tingling in my legs, dizziness, hot flashes, dilated pupils due to blurred vision, nausea.These things go away after about 5 hours after the dose, but the tingling stays, should I be worried?Started Straterra 5 days ago, already noticed huge changes, but the side effects are nasty, should I be concerned",1635428794,809,146
ADHD,"o I've been taking Adderall for a little while now (took a while to find the right dose, but that's beside the point). I definitely identify with a lot of symptoms of ADHD, especially executive dysfunction, and can see a lot of ADHD symptoms present in my childhood (hyperfocus, hyperactivity, problems reading long texts \[which is still present\]).  when I take Adderall, I get a lot of energy, become very motivated, and my mood improves. The ""mental wall"" I feel that gives me the feeling like my brain isn't working to its fullest potential is gone. I've done some personal research on this and the effects of Adderall on me sound a lot more like the ones I hear people that don't have ADHD have when they take it. I've heard people say that Adderall calms people with ADHD. It's honestly making me question my diagnosis, especially since I'm in a psychology class right now and we recently talked about misdiagnosis/overdiagnosis of ADHD. anyone else diagnosed with ADHD feel similarly when they take their Adderall (high energy, motivation, and mood)? Is it semi-normal for people with ADHD to feel this way when on Adderall?Effects of Adderall Make Me Think I Don't Actually Have ADHD",1635428534,1192,204
ADHD,"o this morning, I woke up with the intent on doing yoga, ended up going to get my phone to start a yoga video when my wife stirred and so I just cuddled til she woke and we had breakfast before work. During this whole process, I had a song, Light Up The ky by YellowCard,Yellowcard, stuck in my head on repeat. On the way to work me and my wife were talking about my ADHD and I informed her that I noticed when the lights changed at intersection, sometimes they don't always  change exactly the same time. This time it was the left side that changed first and then the right (they were tenths of a second apart, but still noticeable) which then made me think about tar Wars and whether or Han shot first... yeah, that's how my day started. I actually enjoy having adhd at times because it makes for an interesting conversation at times.Funny bit this morning.",1635428133,859,161
ADHD,"About a year or so ago i was given bupropion to help manage some attention deficit issues i was having while on anti depressants (citalopram). Im fairly certain my personal brain goblins are the classic mix of depression and adhd/autism.  on just citalopram, i did get the ""quiet brain"" feeling i keep hearing about on here and I definitely have been brought out of the pit of depression! I was still pretty unfocused though, although not completely paralyzed like before. I could finish tasks here and there in spurts but I feel like i was still in the adhd mud. I didn't wanna die anymore but i also wasn't getting very much done.  doc later gave me the bupropion to work with my current pill and honestly for a time it did help me focus! After a while though i just ended up feeling angry CONTANTLY. Any little thing would make me blow up and I even yelled at a few completely random people in traffic. This made me kind of freak out and realize something was definitely wrong as I never lashed out in this way before at others. looked up some side effects of bupro and noticed that excessive anger was a rare side effect! I stopped taking it to see if my mood improved and it did! I feel much more centered and much less angry which honestly is kind of a bummer cuz i did receive a bit of a focus boost while on it.  else have similar issues with this? I'm going to look into trying a stimulant instead as I'm ALWAY tired despite sleeping almost an entire day so I know I'm probably running low on some sort of brain energy juice.  taking vitamin D supplements already to no noticable effect...Bupropion and excessive anger?",1635428017,1628,300

ADHD,"I use all sorts of coping mechanisms to try to be productive and disciplined in the evening after work but it often goes wrong, and weekends are a write off if something happens that isn't exactly matching how I visioned the day going.  something interrupts my flow of chores or tasks, I get absolutely derailed and that's it, the day's ruined.

ADHD,"I started a job a month ago that requires coordination, concentration and dexterity/attention to detail. While it isn't always busy, you do have to remember important things to proceed to the next step or process. Last week and most of this week I forgot to take the Concerta I have because I was self conscious about having the medication rattle in my pants pocket and people figuring out what it was. In addition, my sleep schedule has gone down, from 6-7 hours a night to 4-5. my trainer, who is a great guy, can clearly see I'm making more mistakes than he was when he started. I like asking questions to follow up on things and be curious about what I'm making, but I'm worried that I'll be asking the same thing over and over. I've been working on things and then later realizing I forgot to add a part, or switch on/off a knob, or fill out a form, or do something extra. And it shows.  wonder how I can mitigate this, because this is a great place to be with lots of room to move around, and I would hate to continue giving off an aire of incompetence. I took my medication this morning and got about 6 hours of sleep. I don't feel as aloof as I've been.

ADHD,"I. Just. Cannot. Progress. had a bit of a \*\*\*\* start in life, had undiagnosed inattentive ADHD through my whole youth and could never focus or make a decision on anything, especially a career. cruised along in a couple of low paying council jobs in my late teens- mid 20s and was desperate (and still am) to do something with my life.  make matters worse, I made the terribly foolish mistake of pursuing a useless photography degree when I was 26. I then panicked and tried to become more employable by doing a masters (which I failed) in marketing management. Nothing has worked out, no sod will hire me for anything decent where I can train and now I'm a 32 year old CLEANER. day this eats me up inside and takes a hit at my self esteem.

ADHD,"I’ve been incessantly reading about the dopaminergic dysregulation in ADHD because I don’t get it lol. Off the meds, I’m extremely sensitive to sensuous pleasure, feel pumped all the time, even when I’m alone I feel like I’m constantly having a party with myself. I’ve found out that this can be explained by the fact that ‘impact dopamine’ is far higher than ‘passive dopamine’. A way to understand this is that the name ‘baseline dopamine’ (passive/tonic) doesn’t mean how much pleasure you receive from a stimulus but how content you feel when not under the influence of a stimulus; and that under influence your system sprains and pleasure hormones burst out (explanation is metaphorical and not literal) point of confusionMy medicine makes my pupils tiny bit when they run out my pupils becomes massive and then they stay that way until the next dose. This makes no sense for me since the passive dopamine is low. I read a study that hypothesised ‘adrenaline brain part’ (simplification) in ADHD is hyperactivated but I don’t think so because another study found equal net-worth of the hormone (norepinephrine) between patients and controls except for the frontal cortex (where it was less). However it might work in the previous framework. Thoughts?

ADHD,"I think the best advice I have ever received after being prescribed Adderall was from a close friend who also has ADHD and the same prescription. he told me to keep my prescription a secret from my friends for at least the first year. And while that seems crazy, I think she was so right.  am AMAZED by all my friends who constantly ask their ADHD friends for some of their medication. These friends are not college students, they are mostly professionals with thriving careers...and they are still looking to score a bump of what I consider medically necessary.  prescription is a 30 day, one pill a day, on-the-nose monthly refill prescription. I don't have any to share.  I am such a people-pleaser and I do have major issues with rejection (because I HAVE ADHD, but that's another story.) because I was new to the medication, I can totally see myself thinking ""well, I don't really need these pills for this lazy weekend, so maybe I can save it and I can give it to that friend that has been asking....."" etc etc etc and next thing you know I am being hounded by all these people who are undereducated about stimulant medication while I am in a vulnerable and transitional state.  that I have been taking it consistently for a few months now, I feel more emboldened to refuse requests. And after a solid year of taking it, I am sure I will have the backbone I need to fend off these moochers.  feel conflicted because I know that visibility is something we all need right now. And by hiding my medication from others, even when I am only trying to protect myself, I do feel like I am contributing to all these shady misconceptions about our brains and the medicines we do need.  do you think of this advice? While it helps me as an individual, do you think this tactic ultimately helps or hurts the ADHD community?**  note-I am an adult in my late 20s who has told my partner and close family members about my prescription. This advice/rule is meant only for your larger community of people---I think it is important to tell at least one other person close to you that you are starting a new medication in case some freak emergency happens.Do you think this is good advice about medication?",1635426492,2194,396

ADHD,"I've been in highschool (freshman year rn) for about 1-1 1/2 months maybe and I havent made any freinds here, I always had a problem with talking to new people, going into 6th grade from 5th was easy because I just sat with my one freind  that came from my elementary school with me and I kinda made freinds that way, I've tried talking to people every once in a while but it's always just something dumb that completes the convo in like a few seconds, I dont know if its caused by my meds or me breaking up with my ex just before school or I'm just like this, I never knew how to talk to people and to go to other peoples house and hang out I was always the kid who sat in my room playing xbox 24/7, I always thought it would be weird to ask where someone lives and I never know how to start or get into a conversation with people I don't know, but I feel like If I stop taking my adhd meds I'll be more active and talkative and wont really care about how to start something just to do it but I have school, I'm not getting good grades now if I just leave it it'll drop and I'll have to make up for it, but I'm tired of just going through the motions with nothing to really look forward too other then getting home and getting on xbox or oculus or sleeping, I really just need one person here, one freind to sit with and to kinda meet people through them but I dont think I'm gonna get that satisfactionMy adhd meds, I feel like a zombie",1635426399,1438,288

ADHD,Yeah so i live in a country where no one knows about adhd. After researching about adhd and seeing all the memes i was convinced that i have adhd but wasn't able to get diagnosed. I've never been able to study for my exams so i thought that i should try some medication if it's adhd. I went and got ritalin. I took a 10mg dose yesterday and a 20mg dose today. The problem is that i don't notice any change before or after taking the meds like i just took a 20 mg dose and instead of preparing for my exam tomorrow i just wandered around my house then scrolled Instagram and when i realized that i wasted so much time i came here to rant.If the Ritalin isn't working does it mean that i don't have adhd or something else.

ADHD,"To start things of, I'm a 37 year old cisgender man living in the United tates.  Like most of you here, I had a really hard time when the pandemic happened last year.  I broke up with my girlfriend only a few weeks before all of the shutdowns, then I was laid off from my job directly because of the pandemic in ept. 2020.  I had suicidal thoughts and began seeing a counselor for depression and anxiety which I knew had been affecting me my entire adult life.  Things seemed to be going well as I got a tech related job at the local community college and I was exercising and eating healthier, but it all fell apart again when I lost all motivation to get up and go into work. I started researching depression and anxiety more, and eventually stumbled on descriptions of ADHD symptoms, particularly in adults and realized how much they described to me a T: ability to hyperfocus on something to the exclusion of important responsibilities, struggling to maintain a clean and organized living and/or work space, inability to maintain employment for long periods of times, relationships suffering because of a lack of effort to reach out or respond to people in my life that reach out to me.  As a kid I was given an ADD diagnosis and prescribed Ritalin but my parents took me off of it after only a month. finally made the effort to receive an official ADHD diagnosis and along with the ADHD diagnosis I was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder and ocial Anxiety.  None of these surprise me and it just feels like I'm getting a professional to confirm what I've known for a while.  Another key part of the ADHD diagnosis is a cognitive IQ test on which I scored in the 98th percentile overall and the 99th percentile in a few categories.  I'm not sharing these scores to brag, but to illustrate something I've been told by everyone I've ever met about how incredibly bright and intelligent I am despite my apparent disorder. many that post on this subreddit report a feeling of relief and grief after receiving an ADHD diagnosis, I only feel extremely frustrated and incredibly sad.  I cried many times this morning because I hate my brain.  I don't care about how smart I am.  I could care less if I was one of the smartest people on the planet.  I would give up my extreme intelligence if it I meant I could have some sort of normal life.  But I feel like my brain won't let me.  I struggle relating to other people, even my close friends who are also quite intelligent. don't want to be smart.  It's all I've ever heard my entire life from childhood onward and I just don't want it anymore.  It feels like madness to be so observant and analytical.  I think most people don't know what to do with me, and so I just avoid interacting with others because I think people don't want to hear my thoughts.  I'm bawling my eyes out as I'm typing this because it's so frustratingly lonely. I know I have to live with my brain for the rest of my life and that even if somehow I get medicated and/or coaching that deep down my brain is still what it is.  And I hate it.  I hate myself.  I know why my parents ultimately didn't want anything to do with me and why they set me loose when I was 17. was hoping the official diagnosis would improve my poor mood from the last several months of lethargy but instead I feel much worse.  I'm overwhelmed with having to take the steps to receive treatment and the self-loathing I've kept suppressed has finally reared its ugly head. hate that I can't motivate myself that I need to take these steps to try and improve my health.  I hate how the diagnosis has just made me feel more powerless. don't know what to do.Given an ADHD and gifted diagnosis as an adult and I am frustrated and incredibly sad",1635425983,3738,686
ADHD,"Yo, I'm brand new to this subreddit, so forgive my mistakes should they occur.  just thought I'd check here, because Google hadn't yielded any particularly helpful results, but I am testing out a methylphenidate (Cotempla) after being on an amphetamine (Vyvanse), and not only is it doing jackshit for my ADHD, I actually have been exhausted both times I've taken it, and ended up sleeping for hours.

ADHD,"I am almost done with the initial stage of therapy. have gone through an IQ test, DIVA-5 test, and tommorow my mother will be taking a test where they determine if my symptoms persisted during childhood. am 99% confident that I'll get a positive diagnosis, because I've answered almost every single DIVA question with a ""Yes"", and I am pretty sure that I'll be getting a combined diagnosis, as I have both inattentive and hyperactive traits. already doing better since I've learned that I have a very high possibility of ADHD, and since I started catering to that, I have become a lot more efficient and can understand myself easily. I came up with tricks to keep up with everyday life. I am curious how much better I'll be doing with meds.

ADHD,"I’ve been in therapy and have been seeing a psychiatrist for about 6 months now. I have always been against medication, but my anxiety and slight depression was bringing my marriage and other aspects of my life down.  speaking with my therapist he said that I inhibited signs of ADHD, but wanted to treat me with Effexor, so I have been taking this for about 6 months. I have not noticed a difference in my ADHD tendencies (impulsiveness, difficulty staying seated at work, not absorbing information, etc.). The only difference is that my anxiety has gone down a little bit and I don’t really care about anything anymore. I do get some minor mood swings that my wife notices, but nothing major, so after telling my psychiatrist this he wanted to prescribe me medication that is used for bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. I did not take this medication and decided to find a new doctor as he just seemed to prescribe more and more medication without really listening to me and getting to the root of the problem.  I will be seeing a new psychiatrist who has excellent reviews and I am honestly excited to be able to have someone actually listen to me instead of speaking to me over the phone for 10 minutes and then dosing me with more meds.  a venting post, I will keep you all updated with how the new appointment goes!Going to see a new psychiatrist today",1635422996,1359,243
ADHD,"This is in the UK. just passed my test (manual) first time, after taking a *long* time to learn, and barely got any faults at all. bought a new car, took it out for a drive because I know the roads, they're easy round here.

ADHD,"I started at a new clinical site this week with a nurse practitioner. he's nice enough but pretty aloof, and talks really fast and at length almost constantly. I thought maybe it was a personality quirk but as we worked together more she warmed up and I realized we were alike in attitude and our workflow. Then casually in passing she mentioned she has ADHD and apologized if she came off strong, and things made sense. It was also a pretty emotional moment for me. went undiagnosed for 26 years, which were total agony academically. I wanted my parents to have me evaluated, but they repeatedly refused. o I thought it was in my head until I got to grad school, and I fell so hopelessly behind everyone else that I knew something was different about me.  forward a year and a half on Wellbutrin and I ask my preceptor if she was willing to share about her experience with ADHD. Growing up was also hell for her. he said she was also diagnosed late, in nursing school, and felt a similar mix of anger for not catching it sooner and relief from finally figuring out what was bothering her. We had the same treatment regimen and followed the same course of improvement after starting medication. We also both started seeing changes when we transitioned from sitting in lecture for 9 hours a day listening to droning, to the crazy fast pace of ER's and rural clinics that were more suited to our minds. Plus the same struggles with dosage adjustment and juggling multiple patients with our own mental health. he gave me a preview of what it'll be like as a provider with ADHD and gave me tips on how to live our best life with what we've got. I thanked her, and we got right back to work. I look at her, now I see how I'm going to be like in the future. And given her long career and how loved she is by her patients, staff, and definitely by her students, I'm happy with that. Felt like I was lost in a sea of laser-focused, hyper type-A, gossipy students and money-driven, jaded clinicians that all look at me a little funny. Many, many, many times I questioned why I even wanted to practice medicine and if I belonged in that community. This week was the first time I felt truly validated and safe in both education and healthcare, and I just wanted to share how at peace it makes me feel.I'm a PA student on rotation and finally met a preceptor also with ADHD",1635422662,2361,438

ADHD,"I’m a 22 year old woman and I’m in therapy for a year now and I always thought that there’s something wrong with me or that something doesn’t “work” properly. I’m not diagnosed with anything even though I struggle with (moderate probably) anxiety and depression.Around 6 months ago I started researching about ADHD after I related to a few posts I saw about it on social media. The truth is I strongly feel I have it. It just makes so much sense to me.I told my mom and she basically laughed at my face…well she was nicer actually, but it felt like she did. I’ve always been a quiet and shy kid. When I was in primary school, one of my teachers had told my mom I wasn’t focused in class and I was distracted. he took me to get tested but they didn’t give me a diagnosis. Given the fact that I’m a woman I wasn’t hyperactive and it was 15-16 years ago, it could be a false one.I have struggled to concentrate as long as I remember. It was okay in primary school, because my mom helped me to study, but after that my grades weren’t as good, I couldn’t focus, I was pretending I was studying and I became really good at improvising. I wasn’t a bad student but I never seemed to bring myself to study no matter how much I wanted to. ame thing with university. I hadn’t passed more than 15 classes, I couldn’t study even though I knew I had to. What saved me ? Covid and the fact that we had the exams online. Other students gave me most of the answers. I’m 3 classes away from my degree and all that without opening a single book…you can say I was lucky. But I started studying graphic design this year and I’m afraid that this will happen again.I have other symptoms too. Like talking too much and loud, interrupting others and forgetting what I was saying mid sentence. I lose my focus even when people to talk to me directly. I forget to reply to texts, I forget to/can’t keep in touch with friends, I get bored easily, I hyperfixate on things and then I lose interest and my mom has to tell me to do something 15 times for me to do it and the list goes on. know that it could be just in my head. But I relate too much with everything I’ve seen and read. But I’m also afraid to tell my therapist and that she’ll act just like my mom. Btw my best friend studied speech therapy and she is familiar with adhd and she told me that I have obvious symptoms, but idk…anyway I decided to right down every symptom I have, I also printed posts about adhd that I relate to and I found a self report with a symptom checklist for screening and I’ll bring all that to my therapist so she can see I’m serious about this.

ADHD,"Kind of a long one, because I kind of wrote everything out step-by-step. Hopefully it helps/resonates with at least someone on here.    ***tl;dr - if you get that excited feeling when relating to someone's story where you just need to blurt out YOUR story related to it, try to blurt the IDEA behind the WHY your story would have related to theirs, rather than just the raw facts/details of your story (which really only serves to replace theirs). This lets you blurt something out while letting the conversation stay a conversation (rather than stealing it to make it a monologue).***       It's pretty common for us to have problems resisting the urge to blurt out personal versions of a story that someone else just shared. We see it as showing that we care about/can relate to what they'd just been talking about, but other people typically see this as not having listened to their experience and just wanting to start talking about your own experience.    o - what I've realised works well, and is reasonable to implement/maintain (at least for me) with a tiny bit of practice:    Instead of just blurting out the ""what"" version of your story that matches theirs, blurt out the ""why it matters"" part BEHIND your story instead - use the specific story in your head to extract the idea/concept you want to use to relate to them, but keep the fact that you have a personal version/personal details of that story hidden at first. The ""why it matters"" version, without explicitly mentioning your own details, does two really important things:    1. By not including specific details about your own version of the experience, you haven't made the story about yourself.  2. Usually, by connecting with the person you're talking to about the IDEA of the experience they're sharing, it opens it up the conversation a lot more naturally to follow-up questions for both of you (which may eventually lead to you giving the specific details about your own version anyway).  3. Okay there's 3 advantages - it also still lets you blurt out something to make you feel like you've connected to the person by linking your own experiences. That's a super important itch to scratch for us (or at least for me), and why I find this approach so good for me (because I'm not trying to stop/reign in my ADD conversation impulse - I'm just nudging it in a slightly different direction that's more people-friendly).    Okay, example time:    They open up with a story about going to City X, and how great of an experience it was for them, and how they loved the feeling of how alive the city felt.    You had a very similar feeling/experience in City Y, and are now super excited that you have this in common with them and want to share everything about City Y, in a ""Me too!!"" kind of way.    Instead of ""City Y"" popping into your head, and then blurting out: ""ya, I went to City Y, it was also awesome! I loved the feeling of it too, and it was cool in [THI OTHER WAY] and [This other way].....and [this other way]...."", as their eyes gradually lose their excitement from originally sharing their own story....  What you should try to force yourself to do is have ""City Y"" pop into your head.....think about it for like TWO seconds while they're talking, and figure out WHY exactly their story about City X made you think of City Y...and then blurt that out instead, in an open-ended comment way. omething like: ""yes, how cool is it when you can feel that vibe of a new city, and how alive the crowds feel!?""    What you've done is:  - till blurted something out, venting some of that pent up excitement at being able to relate to the other person  - Blurted it out in a way that still, implicitly, let's them know that you have a shared experience/are on the same page  - Rather than having completely hijacked the conversation and made it all about ""factoids""/details of your own, you've instead put it out there in a way that invites even more comments about your comment. Maybe they add a completely new kind of idea about something else they enjoyed about City X, and you can add a different something about things you enjoy about new cities (remember that - although you're using a specific example in your head to draw your ideas from - keep what you say generalised, to prevent yourself from hijacking with too many details).... Maybe they also get excited about having something in common, and ask you for specific details about how exactly you know that you enjoy ""vibes in new cities""....or anything else. Who knows. The whole point is that it will continue to OMETHING, rather than turning into a monologue from you.    Anyway. uper long post, like I said, but I've only really just realised that this is what I do during successful story-swap conversations with people (and what I usually do wrong during unsuccessful conversations like that  :P).    Hopefully this helps someone out there channel their excitement/impulses in a way that make connecting with people feel more natural/less embarassing.LPT for avoiding railroading a conversation by constantly jumping in with your own experiences",1635421010,5089,882

ADHD,"o I'm (F21) in the process of titrating on Xaggitin (methylphenidate hydrochloride). It was going really well for the first few weeks, moving up from 18 to 36 to 54mg. My psychiatrist prescribed me a month of 72 mg, but I thought I might not need to move up because I was feeling pretty good, so I stayed on 54 mg a few more days. Three days ago, I took my medication in the morning, and it did absolutely nothing. The next day was the exact same. If anything, I felt stoned. I was completely unfocused and felt like I was about a thousand miles away. I decided, since it was still early in the day, to add the 18 mg that would bump me up to 72mg. I think it helped a little, but basically didn't bring me back to the 'normal' I've been accustomed to. I took 72 mg today again and feel genuinely fucking terrible. It's been a steadily increasing inverse relationship between racing heart/palpitations and anxiety (and yet somehow also ridiculous fatigue), and the actual efficacy of the medication decreasing seemingly every day. How is it possible that I've gone up a dose, yet the medication is getting less effective (keeping in mind that I increased to 72 because my lower dose of 54 was also becoming steadily less effective)? I feel like I've hit a wall, apropos of nothing. Has anyone else dealt with this? factors: I avoid vitamin C except in the evenings, I take zinc in the mornings because I've heard it helps with absorption, I always take my meds directly after a breakfast of at the very least salmon and zucchini or another vegetable, I do a pretty good job of staying hydrated and I try to get adequate sleep, though admittedly it's been closer to 6-7 hours than 7-8 hours the last few days, what with uni and foul 9AM classes. Another potential factor is that I have AD and live in a part of the world with a really aggressive transition to low light days, so it may be that the onset of that is impacting things. I went out with a friend and had a few drinks (read: 3) last night which is unusual for me, but I spaced them out with glasses of water and rehydrated with water and electrolytes when I arrived home, so I can't imagine that this was a huge factor in how I'm feeling today. Any thoughts would be appreciated (and I know this isn't the place to go searching for medical advice, and I will be reaching out to my psychiatrist shortly–it's just that it will take a while for her to get back to me, and I'm trying to get some perspective in the meantime by asking around).

I’m homeschooled which is a blessing and a curse, but i’m very behind on my assignments so I was trying to work on catching up. Impossible. I have felt so terrible and empty these past few days and I’ve had no motivation for absolutely anything. I had one assignment to do and for three days straight I would sit at my computer and just look at the screen and then get distracted and do something else. I couldn’t bring myself to do that assignment. The farthest I would get would be writing a sentence and then my focus was somewhere else and I couldn’t bring myself to touch the assignment again. I just couldn’t. It was terrible and I felt like such a disappointment and failure. But tonight, at 4am, I found out I could do that assignment on my phone. I wanted to check if there was another way I could possibly get the assignment done and I had a hint of motivation and hope that using my phone would do the job. I don’t know how it happened, but I ended up completing the entire assignment and even doing more all on my phone while laying in bed. The thing is, I know I wouldn’t of been able to do that on my computer without destroying my mind. Like, I wouldn’t even of been able to force myself, at least not with how i’ve been feeling. Does anyone have any clue why this happened??Couldn’t do homework on PC but could do it perfectly on my phone??",1635414721,1477,280
ADHD,"Inspired by person who posted none of the meds they tried allowed them to ""focus for 8 hours straight"" like some people experience (not sure if this is the right sub for this question) one of the things with ADHD is executive dysfunction, right? And meds are supposed to help people with ADHD with that, and if it works properly, it's supposed to help reduce distractions and improve focus.  for me, the meds help me focus and reduces distractions, yes, but it doesn't help me focus on what I should be focusing, and yeah, it makes it easier to do what I should be doing, but easier doesn't necessarily mean it's going to happen, or put simply, executive dysfunction.  question is, for non-ADHD people when they take meds (or ig it'd be considered drugs in this case), is it more consistent for them to be able to focus on what they need to, like it literally is just an energizing focus drug and they can *choose* what they want to do?** part of the main point questions (unrelated to above; but med-related):• Why is the max Adderall XR dose 30mg, but the IR is also 30? Assuming IR doses are typcically taken 2x a day, and that IR forms have a higher abuse potential... idk wouldn't it make sense for the XR dose to be higher? The main reason for no caffeine with stimulant meds is side effects, right? Like insomnia, jitters, anxiety, etc. I've found that they work synergistically (too much coffee by itself makes me jittery/anxious, meds make me tired, but both together keeps me more awake and I'm also able to consume as much coffee as I want without the jittery). I've also only been diagnosed for a few months, and I'm not dependent on coffee (like no caffeine withdrawal). Does this indicate I should think about increasing dose or switching meds? I'mma bring this up with my doctor, but some knowledge on this would be helpful on structuring that conversation.  I'm noticing that water just kinda goes right through me. I'm trying to stay hydrated and supplementing with electrolytes, but it's hard when one minute, I'm watering my dehydrated self, and the next, it feels like my bladder is about to explode like no gradual build up, just really sudden gotta go feeling.

ADHD,"Y’all… my label maker is saving my relationship and I wish I would have gotten one YEAR ago.  here is how. You know how we lose everything? Well my unconscious way to avoid this is just putting the things where I use them and never putting anything away. This works great for me, but for my neurotypical boyfriend, he is sick of living in a disaster zone. Well the best solution I’ve found to this problem is to just buy containers for this stuff and giving it a tidy place where I use it. works great when I put things away, but my boyfriend has a tendency to “just shove stuff places” and I can never find anything. o he just takes everything that was on the surface he wants cleared and puts it in a bin, and I can’t find anything. He also doesn’t take note of each item he puts in bins, so when I am looking for something like my chapstick, he will say he didn’t touch it and doesn’t know where it is 🙄. I bought this label maker, and I labeled the containers, then I started labeling the things, and it probably seems comical to label chapstick with a “living room chapstick” sticker, but I gotta tell ya, it stays in the dang living room. I label my charge cords, I label my remotes, everything. o now, when he wants all of the things to go away, he looks at the labels on the bins, and puts everything away. We legit NEVER fight about the house stuff anymore, and this was honestly a weekly battle before. the best part. ince labeling the places, I am finding that I am more likely to put things away too! My ADHD mind sees the “art supplies” drawer, and I set things back where they go!  I bought the Brother Pt-d400 label maker. You can add little graphics and borders, and I found some cheap off-brand label stuff too.

My senior tutor has told me off for it (a bit hypocritical because he does the same thing).  identified that I avoid answering them for a combination of the following reasons: very anxious about the outcome of my email (these are rare) will be tiresome to collect all the information I need for an email (if I have to cross reference dates, explain a timeline, include lots of detail) exhausting to have to fake being polite  that last point, I don't mean I want to be rude, I mean there's so much B I have to include in my emails that doesn't involve the subject matter.

ADHD,"Hello, am a 21 year old woman, and after doing some research I am pretty sure I have ADHD. I am in a way worried that I won’t get diagnosed, if that makes sense?  have been to a psychologist before. Beforehand, I told my parents that I thought I had social anxiety. My parents are very «against» diagnoses, and always think I am overreacting. I also have a bit of health anxiety, and I think that because of this they invalidate my actual worries about my health. When I told my mom that I wanted to go to the doctor to tell him about my anxiety, she was worried that getting a diagnosis would affect my thoughts, and make the anxiety worse. Turns out I do have social anxiety, and I was sent to a psychologist who helped me and «cured me» of my worst symptoms. that I have read quite a bit about ADHD, things have fallen into place for me. All of my procrastination, anxiety and stress could be because of ADHD. I always did well in primary school, but struggled with homework and never studied for tests. My grades got worse as I got older. I never studied for tests, or if I did, it was the night before. But I graduated from high school with a high GPA. I got into the school I wanted, and I’m still getting good grades - but I feel like it’s because i’m lucky. I am struggling to follow along in class, I havent read a single page of a book unless it’s under pressure, and I don’t do any school work unless I absolutely have to. When I was in primary school I could read for hours without interruption. Now I can’t even finish a movie without being on my phone at the same time. I am still getting good grades. This is also part of my fears when it comes to getting a diagnosis - am i doing «worse enough» to get diagnosed? am either very effective or not effective at all. If I get stuff done (even if it’s just grocery shopping and working out) I feel super proud. But I need to write lists that I can «check off» to get it done, and plan it the day before. Other days, I can lie in bed all day even though I have things i need to do. And even though I feel awful and sad that I’m not getting anything done, I just can’t seem to get myself to do it. Even though it’s just vacuuming the floor or doing laundry. am so emotional, and it’s affecting my relationship with my family. I can’t go shopping for long with my mom, for example, because I get overstimulated - my back hurts, i get sweaty, there are too many people, the lights are too bright etc. This makes me irritable, which again makes her irritable and not wanting to go shopping or do things with me. When we were on a family holiday once, I had to go back to the hotel room because there were too many people, while my family went and did fun stuff without me. I envy my sinlings because I know my parents think they’re easier to deal with than me. am so indecisive and I think it’s getting worse too. Even if I just need to decide what alcohol to buy for the weekend, i need friends to help me choose. I can stand by the candy shelf for ten minutes without having the slightest idea of what to get. I even call my parents sometimes to help me decide what groceries to buy - it feels so stupid and I feel like a kid who needs help with the stupidest things even though I am highly functioning and I live by myself.  have a long list of symptoms, and I can’t list them all here. My point is that I’m scared of going to a doctor with my concerns because I don’t want to be invalidated once again. When i read about ADHD, it’s as if everything falls into place. But what if I’m not struggling “enough”?  And what if I don’t get a diagnosis? Do I have to struggle with this forever?Struggling to go to the doctor for a diagnosis",1635409132,3692,721

I really got good at maintaining $3000-$5000 but because of my drastic change of 1st-3rd shift I would sleep during trading hours and subsequently had to pull out.  have nothing to fall back on, had to pull out the remainder of my money in crypto and stocks to pay bills..

Two hours later and It's basically leveled out. No anxiety or anything like that during the first hours, just a strong feeling of ""this is definitely stimulants kicking in""...of you know what I mean. question is to people who has experience with upping dosage, is it normal and a part of adjusting to the new dose and does the body ""get used to it""?  do feel calm and collected and focused, and I do know I respond well to methylphenidate.

Dysgraphia, expressive language issues, and possibly even dyspraxia.

ADHD,"... and I am, as they often say around here, bricking it.  been around six months since I (41M, UK) stumbled into the ADHD community and I started to realise that maybe, at middle age, my brain hadn't been behaving as advertised for the longest time and that maybe I'm not just a lazy, scatter-brained, unfocused screw-up. GP referred me to the local psychiatric team, and two successive psychiatric evaluations (one via Zoom, one in person) agreed to refer me to a local NH Adult ADHD service. I badgered them every few weeks to find out what the waiting times were like (my GP said it was up to 2 years) but the reception staff at the specialists informed me that it had reduced down to around 6 months . I got an appointment text through for my first proper specialist assessment (the first is via phone, the second in person) and, yeah, I'm panicking a little. My wife and daughter are doing their best to reassure me, and I've already had multiple professionals say 'Yeah, it's probably ADHD' but I'm terrified that the specialists will tell me I'm fine. I have no idea where that leaves me.  tell me I'm just overthinking this.First ADHD specialist appointment coming up...",1635401773,1179,209
ADHD,"37/m - primarily inattentive.  Yes, I got diagnosed wayyy late in life. Today I took my first dose of ritalin 20 mg extended release.  I also suffer from panic disorder so I was a bit nervous to try it.  I recorded my thoughts and feelings. I was also at work so I couldn't constantly record stuff. - Took my first dose with coffee - Nothing - Noticeably better mood.  I'm not feeling like I have to rush to finish a lot of stuff and therefore feel like I'm being ""actually productive.""  - Took the time to organize a cabinet because I thought it would be better in the long run (I don't usually prioritize long term utility at the expense of short term) - Better mood still felt, realizing that I may be using alcohol to get the feeling of calm contentedness that I'm feeling now.  Also noticed that I had more of an urge to be friendly and interact with people. Decrease in social anxiety? - Pleasant mood is fading, definitely falling back to baseline.  got about 4 hours of a day that was easier to think, easier to accomplish.  I did have a very slight headache.  I think I expected to feel like I drank too much coffee but it was nothing like that. It was calm, like I had the time to do things the right way and not jump from one to the next.  I still felt forgetful. I'm wondering if this pattern continues (4 hours of effect for an 8 hour drug) if a dose increase is in my future. It wasn't nearly as dramatic as I was anticipating, but it was definitely better than my baseline.Took my first ritalin today and wanted to share my experiences.",1635401658,1551,292

ADHD,"Hey all.  to share a story from what happened today at work. I've got a pending degree in the IT field, and simply cannot get an interview despite numerous attempts to alter my resume and CV, both applying with ADHD as my disability, and without. I think it has to do with my age, but I digress - I physically sell my body for hard labor, because I can't get a desk job to save my life, apparently. the place I'm working has a very small knit team. I was referred to the place by a friend, and in our group there is only three of us. We have a boss, a lead, and me. Normal org charts respect the boss over a lead, but apparently not here.  furious, but I'm sure some of you will appreciate what I've been going through. Fuck. explaining to someone who doesn't have ADHD how hard it is to stay on task when you're learning a new skill. It's not terribly difficult to paint, or fix things, but when you're naturally curious like I am, paired with the infinitely wonderful distraction ability we all share in different flavors with one another - it's a perfect shit storm of fuck ups at work. do you deal with a boss telling you one thing, and a lead telling you to do something different? Especially when a lead is getting mad at you, for ""having to hold your hand"", and ""going around his back"", when all I've tried to do is get clarification on parts that don't make sense.. afraid to switch my insurance, because I heavily need to get back onto medication. It took me a really long time to believe that, but it's absolutely critical. The meds I've found that work, they're so damn expensive without state insurance, but I'm not making enough money to afford it and medical insurance. sure my spending habits will get better with medication, but that's such a scary thought, cutting things so close to zero every month just because of medicine. But it's impacting my family life, friends, and now work, and I don't know what else to do. I've tried behavioral health, I live the r/HydroHomies lifestyle, and I stopped consuming legally recreational 'medicines' to try and help. Hell, even tried vegetarian, cut out dairy, and stopped eating bread/take out. But I still can't get free from this ongoing burden of unintentional self-harm through my social shortfalls. .I &lt;3 you all though.

ADHD,"orry for any mistakes in advance english is not my native tongue but I'm trying :)  well, as the title says - I'm just wondering when it became more possible to be diagnosed with ADHD as a girl in Germany? I had a discussion - that ended in a kind of screaming match - with my parents because I wasn't diagnosed with ADHD in my childhood and it just ruined my life and academical future. not diagnosed yet bit I’m 99.999% sure I do have it, currently trying to get an appointment at a Uniklinik. For reference I'm more of a combined type with less hyperactivity and more inattentiveness. father is pretty sure I don't have it, but never tried to get himself informed about it since the day I told them that it's possible i have ADHD. He told me I rely too much on the internet (well, where else may I find so many resources and experience reports?). mother said it was impossible for me to be diagnosed in my childhood because noone knew about ADHD in girls during my schooltime (elementary school 1998-2002 then 'Gymnasium' till 2010).  she told me she wanted me to go to evaluation for psychological problems the time I was 12yo but I didn't want to go. Yeah sure, which 12yo can make lifechanging decisions for her mental health and have that much self-reflection to evaluate her brain malfunctioning? I'm sure she just doesn't want to take responibility for this sh\*t ruining my life, but that's another story. yould you please tell me if it really was impossible as they say? you for taking the time reading and for your answers!When did AD(h)D in girls become 'popular' diagnosing in Germany?",1635401228,1599,287

ADHD,"tl;dr: I got diagnosed with adhd I'd say nearly a year ago? since then, my psychiatrist has tried a few different medications on me, but none of them seem to help at all, and I'm wondering if this is a common problem, if anybody knows why this is, and if anyone has any ideas moving forward (such as when I have my next upcoming appointment with the psychiatrist). longer version: like I said, I got diagnosed around a year ago. probably also of note is that I'm 18, have primarily the inattentive type, and have also been prescribed a drug called wellbutrin/bupropion, which I believe doesn't react very well with some adhd meds, hence why I've been prescribed the ones I've had rather than some others. first one I tried was vyvanse, which I took for a few months I believe. however, I got a lot of side effects from it like mood swings and difficulty focusing for the first bit, but any visible benefits, so we decided that it wasn't worth it upping the dose because even if it did help I'd have to go through all of the side effects again. second one was atomoxetine (I think), and the first time I took a pill, within half an hour I was shaking, unable to think or speak clearly, and was advised by my family doctor and a pharmacist to absolutely not take another dose. I'm on biphentin (and have been for a few weeks), and this is the first one where I haven't had really bad side effects, but I feel like it's not working at all? or at least it's not making anything any better. I still procrastinate for weeks on easy-to-complete important tasks, and I've barely noticed a change in my ability to focus. it's like nothing has changed. this point I'm losing hope that medication can help me at all? I've tried a few at this point, and none of them have had any effect on me. I have an appointment with my psychiatrist coming up, but it's in almost a month away, and besides she doesn't have adhd and it's not like she has access to a community like this; so I want to know, does anyone have this same problem, and what do you think I should do to help myself?medication hasn't been working for me at all - is this a common problem?",1635400613,2138,401

ADHD,"I have the most unstable appetite and I wonder if it’s due to my adhd. I struggled with ED in high school but have since thought to have a healthy relationship with food. Now I have weird habits of eating and I wonder if it because of my past relationship with food or adhd. My appetite I’ve noticed is based on my menstrual cycle, as the only time I genuinely feel hunger is the week prior to starting my period. Otherwise I simply eat because people around me are eating. I just recently noticed this pattern once my boyfriend started asking me “what did you eat today” or “have you eaten today” and many times I’d simply forgotten. It isn’t like it was in the past where I would purposefully suppress my thoughts of hunger or avoid meals but I go the whole day without eating without noticing. When I do eat, I eat a lot, and when people suggest a meal or going out to eat I get excited but me on my own, the thought of eating doesn’t cross my mind unless it’s the week before my period. o my question is, is this something else people experience with adhd or is the an extension of my previous ED?Do you struggle with appetite?",1635400333,1131,215

I started to take ritalin at age 16 years old right now I’m 19 years old, I  started with ritalin 10 mg for 2 years but in those two years I felt like in a emotional roller coaster because it was shorter-released, I used to have a lot of mood swings and I survived for 2 years, when turning 19 I talked to my physician and she told me about changing it to concerta (long-released) so in that way my body wouldn’t absorb the entire pill in a short period of time and get those swing moods. Okay so right now I’m taking 18 mg of Concerta per day, when I started to take it my mood was really good for a couple of days but after 2 weeks I feel depressive even taking antidepressants, I feel with low energy and motivation, so I decided to increase my dosage to two pills per day one in the morning and one in the afternoon to see if maybe that could improve, like when I started with 18 mg now with 36 mg I feel really good when I started the medication but for couple of days but after 1 week I’m feeling bad back again I don’t know what should I do?

It took a few hours for the first dose to kick in but I  have had similar effects described by others here. I had a brief ""euphoric"" moment, improved concentration, less easily distracted and less fidgety. I even felt happy doing mundane jobs like tidying my room a bit and doing the dishes. However, I experience far less improvement then I would expect after what ive read here. I.e. would still get distracted/zone out sometimes during my university lectures (way less often but it would still happen), I would also still get fidgety as well and play with my pen. I don't know if it was just my imagination but it felt like the medication would wear off very quickly too (Like an hour of its peak). Also noticed an increase in energy and heart rate, causing a little bit of discomfort.

ADHD,"Why does it feel like you are fighting for a diagnosis rather than simply looking or asking for one? it took a lot for me to admit I needed support and although I've always been supportive and there for others with mental health issues or behaviour stuff I've always seemed to suppress my own. It's taken a lot to reach out for support and look for the official diagnosis rather than just assuming I was struggling like its a normal day to day. after my first GP meeting they agreed that it seemed looking for a diagnosis was a good idea. This can take 18 months to 2 years to get and in the meantime to help with the depression and anxiety they gave me sertraline. On my second appointment the GP and I discussed the tablets and how I was feeling, we had a good conversation Purley around depression and how I'm now feeling.  was no conversation about ADHD or the autism diagnosis I'm seeking. And although all my behaviours and past point towards this she felt that I'm ""clearly"" depressed and that there is no way I have ADHD as I am ""up"" when I go there and self-aware!

I can accomplish tasks that should take 10s if not 20s more hours that I can do it in. This doesn't mean there can't be issues or problems to resolve that are uncertain, but as long as I can solve them alone its no problem.  If I had to paint a shed and I needed to pick a color. I would think through and make the best choice of color. Task done.  2: If I had to paint a shed, and a color needed to be picked, but I had to get chosen by an art shed paint consultant, I now am thinking about all the uncertain possibilities that could happen once I have to bring someone else in. 99% of the time I know logically they will just say paint it blue. Cool easy. How I think is that they will pick some crazy color that I won't be able to find, so I'll have to somehow find it or have the art consultant change his mind. Task not even started.  I lack is any task that has any uncertain outcome. The uncertainty of the outcome weighs me down so much I find it so difficult to start. I make impossible large because I think of all the outcomes that could bring on even more work. I blow up the simple tasks because I find logical reasoning the task might get bigger. I do say logical because I don't make up 1 in a million type scenarios.  example; This week I had to recreate a 4th Qtr. report for a client because they made a big switch. basically a 30-40 job. I heard about over the weekend. Monday morning I just started cranking because I knew exactly what I had to do.. I knew how much work it was, but I also knew exactly every step of the way to archive it so I didn't even flinch.  on this MONTH task list... I need to transfer a lease of a commercial coffee maker because we switched offices. I need to just tell them hey we moved and took it with us, bill us here. Literally been 3 weeks and I have yet to do it. I have never done this. In my mind this 10 min task will somehow blow up in to a huge ordeal. Example we can't do that, we should have not taken it. Now its going to be this huge thing etc etc.  If I can see a task start to finish in my mind its easy.

I was on meds for years until when  I was about 12 when my step dad decided I should be taken off them after doing research into ADHD meds causing brain damage.  i was on them as a kid I was very outgoing, social, active and always wanted to be out doing something and be with people. But now years later, I'm insanely introverted, only wanna do things alone, I never go out except for work, I can never bring myself to wanna be around people, I'm always finding excuses to get out of things and all I do is sit around watching movies or gaming. been really thinking about getting back on meds.

I have a lot of trouble finishing projects, maintaining hobbies and even finishing books and tv shows that I’m interested in, and I’m too indecisive to make any progress towards goals in my life or figure out a career path to take. am definitely struggling to function as an independent adult in certain ways. Unlike a lot of my friends my age my sleep schedule has not adapted to working and I will still stay up until 3 and sleep till 1 pm when I can. ometimes I sleep late on workdays if I feel like I can get away with it since I work from home, but I know it’s a bad habit and I end up feeling lethargic and depressed all day. I eat like crap, don’t cook much and feel overwhelmed at the thought of cooking new things because I don’t know how and when I don’t know how to do something I just avoid doing it instead of learning how. It’s hard not to constantly compare myself to my peers who are morning people, cook regularly and eat healthy food, exercise, etc. I try to implement routines or plans for myself (melatonin and light box to help with sleep, getting up at a consistent time, exercise routines and resolving to eat better) but I never end up sticking to them. I just write a plan/routine in my notes app, feel motivated, and then never look at it again. After failing to change my habits and stick to my resolutions so many times, I kind of go into things expecting to fail. Help??

ADHD,"I’ve recently begun working an office job, and I have very mixed thoughts about it. While I enjoy having a stable income, I feel like my brain and body are melting as I sit for 8/9 hours a day. I’m usually very active, but incorporating activities feels overwhelming. I’m learning a job that I’ve been told will take a year to learn, so I understand there will be some learning curves, but I feel like I frustrate my supervisor. I will space out while she is instructing me on something important, and not even realize it until it’s too late, I’ve misplaced files, and there seems to be a billion spreadsheets for every task. All of this is condensed to a computer that I’m locked to for hours.  do go on walks most days after work, but my brain is so frazzled after working hard to focus that it takes me two hours to cook a simple dinner, and by then, it’s time to wind down for bed. I don’t plan to stay at this job permanently- maybe just a year or two before I apply for grad school (which is a whole other thing).  was prescribed 40mg of Adderall in University, took a break, then tried 20mg of Vyvanse. To provide some context regarding my concerns, I’ve struggled with very disordered/restrictive eating since I was 10/11. This resulted in me becoming anemic, and having hypoglycemic episodes. While my eating patterns are far healthier than they have been in the past, I’m concerned that the side effects of taking medication will trigger my disordered eating. During the time period I took medication, I was in the process of recovering- but the side effect of completely losing my appetite made it VERY difficult to eat on days I took my medication. I want to note that I very sporadically took my medication because of this side effect. is a huge part of me that doesn’t want to rely on medication, but at the same time, I know many people find it beneficial. My focus was fantastic when I took meds, but I stopped taking it because I really needed to get in the habit of eating full meals.  anyone have experience with this?

ADHD,"TLDR; Today I had the first of two sessions of ADHD assessment, and it went ‘well’ and I’m feeling kind of complicated about it.  had an exam this morning which was really hard. I studied as much as I could for it but it required obscene amounts of memorisation and my memory is crap. 12 hours after the exam and I’m beating myself up over two questions in particular. The first is something new I’ve been trying to learn over the last few days. I must have reviewed it 15 times and it just wouldn’t stick. The second question is something I picked up very quickly and have answered correctly numerous times in the last few months, and yet today I just couldn’t remember if the answer was one thing or another. Just *poof*, totally gone. o I had that experience this morning, feeling totally defeated and fried, but also feeling hopeful that tonight I would be taking steps to make my life a bit easier.  fast forward a few hours and I’m working through the psychometric assessments and I kind of feel like… I’m flying through 4/5ths of them? I’m pants at any of the number ones. But the visual ones in particular, the woman doing the testing was like “I shouldn’t say this, but you’re so good at this!” I’m tired, but I’m working hard because it’s feeling so good to be getting the right answers. I needed this today. But also I’m thinking “wait. I didn’t necessarily want to ace this. There is so much that these tests surely can’t pick up? Like, sure I’ve managed to remember some animals repeated at me because I chunked them, but can I show you the long list of things I’ve been putting off? What about how I frequently forget my own phone number or can’t remember the four digit passcode of my bf of 8 years’ phone?” now questioning whether I even have adhd symptoms. I suppose that’s the point. Maybe the testing will show that I don’t and that doesn’t invalidate my experience, just that maybe I need a different explanation and solution. But it’s scary to have gotten to a point where maybe the thing I’ve been using to explain why things feel especially hard for me might be snatched out from under me and then I’m back at square one.  guess I’m not quite sure what I’m looking for, but I’d be interested to hear if this resonates with anyone else?

The worst part is that even though I really don't want to keep doing this, there's nothing I'd rather do instead. I feel like I've completely run out of options. tried so many different things just to end up where I am now; 24 years old, no degree, broke, living with my parents and absolutely zero prospects in life.

ADHD,"TL;DR: I was prescribed medication before getting a formal diagnosis and I’m concerned about the effect my medication had on my assessment. Have any of you gone this route of getting a formal diagnosis after being medicated?  everyone, so my Psychiatrist prescribed me Adderall a few weeks ago after trying all kinds of combinations of anti-depressants and anxiety medications for about 3 years. We even tried maxing out Wellbutrin and that wasn’t enough. Adderall has truly been life-changing for me. I genuinely started thinking my “depression symptoms” were incurable/unmanageable, but since becoming properly medicated I’m content for the first time in my life and things are finally just easier.  had an ADHD assessment yesterday (because of state regulations despite being medicated) and I’m incredibly stressed about it. It lasted about 2.5 hours and consisted of an interview, IQ test with different batteries, written test (just symbols and stuff though), computer test, and a “personality test” to complete at home. I feel like I didn’t get to say everything I wanted to say and I know I struggled a lot with the IQ test (especially math—I was timed out of a lot of questions). I’m just really nervous about my results, and I don’t know if it’s imposter syndrome or legitimate grievances.  my main question is: has anyone done ADHD testing while medicated? I obviously told them I took my medication that day (I considered not taking it but had to drive an hour on a long stretch of boring highway and knew I needed it to drive properly). I’m just worried that it skewed my results especially on the cognitive tests. I’m sure Adderall being effective for me factors into their conclusion, but I don’t really know.

ADHD,"I (22 M) was just diagnosed with ADHD, which is... a lot. I'm partly processing, partly asking for advice, so buckle in and I'll try to sum it up into a nice question format at the end. started to notice that something may not be right last summer, when I was working a job outside my very flexible and forgiving job in the family business for the first time. Being in high school and college, I knew that I was forgetful and made careless mistakes, but I got good enough grades and had enough stimulation/variety to get through without much consternation. All that changed when I was on a consistent grind with few deadlines and little accountability. I have had 3 different internships since that point, each of which I have absolutely loved, but I kept running into a massive lack of focus and inability to get myself to work. It was incredibly frustrating because I *wanted* to do the work, but just could not do it. ounds familiar here, I bet. I have the language to describe what has been happening to me now, which is liberating, but also confusing. finally clicked for me last semester when I was doing a social work internship and had several clients with ADHD who said things that hit just a little bit too close to home. I relocated twice over the course of the summer, but promised myself that when I was able to settle, I would seek a diagnosis. I ended up moving back home (lots of baggage there, but I am glad to be here for the time being), and broke the news to my parents that I wanted to get some answers. That experience was... less than ideal. My dad was somewhat understanding, as he revealed to me (later, in private) that he suspected he might be in a similar situation but keeps himself in check partly because of his very stimulating job as a lawyer and partly by judicious use of caffeine and alcohol to keep him alert and calm (which I know may sound slightly alarming, but I assure you that he's actually very well put-together, and I know a thing or two about alcoholics from my family history, but we'll get to that). I talked him through how alcohol and caffeine are both unpleasant for me, and he respected my desire to seek out some more help. My mom, however, wouldn't hear it. he chalked it up to my diet, exercise, and social habits, and said that I never had a problem before so essentially I just needed to get over myself. Having expected this response, I was not destroyed, but certainly dismayed. ended up talking with her more about how just getting a diagnosis and more information did not mean I was trying to write off my problems and that I did not intend to immediately get medicated, and she reluctantly agreed to let me seek a medical evaluation. Well, after doing intake with a PMHNP and then doing a QB test, she told me that I had ADHD. Again, not a surprise for me (though I was hoping that a diagnosis would help me to feel like there was a clear path forward, ha). After talking the doc through my family history of alcohol and substance abuse, as well as the fact that I know I have addictive tendencies and respond poorly to caffeine, she recommended that I try trattera/atomoxetine, which is one that stood out to me in my research because it also reduces symptoms of anxiety. now I'm suck in a conundrum. I have my test results, and I think I want to move forward with medication, but I don't think my mother will be supportive, and my dad won't either until she at least stands by. When I am in conversation with her, she says that I should be working out, eating differently, and out socializing with ""good people."" Never mind the fact that I am in church groups four days out of the week, I regularly talk with close friends from in college who she loves, and I spend lots of time with my high school friends who are some of the best people I know; she is also the one who cooks most of the time in my family, and she does a really good job making sure that we are all given nutritionally balanced (and lovely) meals. Admittedly, I could be doing more to get moving, but I have always found my motivation to work out extremely low. Last summer, one of my online school classes was running, and I did fine because my grade was on the line, but I honestly hated every second of it and didn't experience any pleasure from it (so if anyone has tips on how to make movement more engaging, hit me up, I'm desperate at this point).  really overwhelming. I don't think my mom is a bad person, but she is the strongest-willed person I have ever met and I do not think she is aware that other people just are not that way. he has always had high expectations for me, and I have appreciated how that has spurred me to be my best self, but I do not know how to explain to her that this diagnosis doesn't change that I'm her son and that I'm still capable, I just need a different kind of help because my brain is different. It feels frustrating to get through to her because when she brings up these concerns, and I address them calmly and factually, she gets upset that I am ""not listening"" to her. ure, I could just go around her, I'm an adult, but as I am living off my parents' generosity (and insurance) for this period of life, I do not think that is either a right nor wise thing to do. r/ADHD, what articles or books are out there for someone who is hesitant to address ADHD? Are there reputable and engaging resources to help me get through this process?

ADHD,"I could use the help of this community; a friend of mine (female) was recently diagnosed with ADHD and as she explained her daily struggles pre diagnosis all I could think is how unbelievably parallel it sounds to my wife (35F).   I began doing more research on common symptoms of ADHD in adults, discussing them with her mother as we both have a shared concern for the growing intensity of her daily struggles and we both are convinced she should absolutely talk to a professional about a diagnosis.       on why we believe she may have ADHD... this is a bit disorganized and I apologize for that.. incredibly impulsive, especially when triggered - I will literally walk into a room to find it partly dismantled (as in the physical room - walls/trim/etc).. most of which get probably 80 or 90% completed but not totally or hundreds of dollars of supplies showing up to the house for a new hobby she's decided to undertake and rashly bought for it.  These hobbies usually last for an extended time (a year or so) and she will be insanely hyper focused on them, to the point of essentially neglecting those around her, but for one reason or another - they'll fade and a new one will pop up.   A lot of the time its because she'll set insanely high bars for herself and anything less is failure - whether it be a to do list that no 3 adults could possibly complete in a day, expecting to be a professional within a few weeks, or like when she had her Etsy shop with made to order products and gave herself two weeks to ship but would run herself ragged to get product out the next day no matter how many orders came in or how stretched thin it made her   is overstimulated incredibly easily, unable to handle any sort of stress at all, and her frustration tolerance is near zero which sends her into intense mood swings at least a few times a week (on a good week).  Work is especially triggering as it's, by her own admittance, an easy job but one that can be menial or tedious, but just about anything/one can set her off - from a small hiccup in a project to the kids being typical toddlers or even a person saying a mundane sentence that she twists into something it couldn't possibly mean and takes as an insult/attack on her - to the point that all of us, myself and her family, find it hard communicating with her.    This usually all comes out in anger and she has a tendency to blurt out sentences that can be pretty vicious without thinking about the consequences of it.    has incredibly low self-esteem, is always anxious in social settings, is easily embarrassed by literally anything (she won an award at work and could not have been more angry at me when I bragged about being proud of her).   he is very prone, as I stated before, to having emotional outbursts when she perceives someone as not liking her or slighting her in any way (I recently bought the wrong kind of bread and was scolded heavily for being inconsiderate of her requests... she doesn't even eat bread, only our toddler and I do - but she took it quite hard).   lot of these swings in mood and energy will come with what feels like a paralysis of anxiety... she should be doing other things (according to her) but will instead just lay scrolling through her phone unable to pull herself out of it (also, according to her).. which just leads to more anxiety later that she failed/is now overloaded/etc   could probably fill a few more paragraphs with day to day struggles we face,  honestly.. problem is, my wife is very resistant to facing any issues.. it took me 4 years of urging (with plenty of angry push back) to get her to even consider therapy.   I could really use some suggestions, if any of you have been in a similar position - what approach to broaching it worked best?   I don't want her to think its an attack or that I'm judging her.

I am trying to convince my mom to take me to see a doctor to see if that's what is going on, but I get the impression that she thinks that I'm just being lazy or looking for attention.  have struggled with several things for as long as I remember. My thoughts are just all over the place, I can think through anything with any kind of organization. I feel like I'm never really here, like I'm stuck in my head. I can't sleep. It's like I can't turn my brain off.  I procrastinate a lot. Caffeine helps a lot of this.  just cannot get anything done. It's like I'm constantly putting everything off or just completely ignoring it. of the hardest things is that I'm either all the way off or all the way on. Either I am just kind of floating around/spaced out, can't do anything, or I am super into something like I can't pull myself away, and I don't eat and I don't talk and I get really agitated and stay super spaced out if I'm forced to stop. But after I get super into something, I'll do it nonstop for like a while, but then every time I try to do it again I can't enjoy it or focus on it.  haven't really talked to anyone other than my sister about what they experience with ADHD, so am I just a lazy teenager who doesn't force herself to do anything? I am really just now realizing that maybe some of this stuff is not something that everyone experiences. I feel like maybe I really am just being dramatic or something, but it has all gotten bad enough that I'm desperate to see if ADHD is what's happening and try medication or something if it is.  be very grateful for any advice. Thanks!maybe I have ADHD or maybe I am just dramatic",1635389798,2009,388
ADHD,"I have a hard time going to sleep when i should. Id rather play games, scroll through social media, eat, or just fucking sit there because i cant sleep.

ADHD,"What the title says. I not only have ADHD but also pretty bad allergies and asthma, as well as occasional depression and frequent anxiety, and I keep the meds for these things on the coffee table.

We aren't minimalists, there's stuff on counters and shelves everywhere here. Nor are either of us are shy or sensitive about our meds, we don't hide that part of our lives from the few friends that actually come into our home. Overall, we feel relatively little embarrassment about the fact that we have bodies and brains which occasionally don't work right. For some reason, though, she's always trying to clear ANYTHING that's left on the coffee table and as a result, basically hides my meds from me. doesn't see it that way. he keeps putting them in the bathroom, or putting little boxes on the coffee table and tucking the bottles away inside them. I told her maybe a basket would work since I could see through it to the bottles, but she got one with basically opaque sides and it's exactly the same problem as stowing them in a box. No matter how many times I try to explain my perspective to her, she just won't stop freaking out about my small amount of potentially-life-saving clutter. is starting to become something we fight about, and I'm now fearfully keeping an inhaler in my pocket at all times because I'm worried she'll hide it from me when I really need it and I'll die or end up in the ER. any of you have the same problem, and if so how have you handled it? Is there a storage solution you've found that works? Is there a way to explain this that will actually get through to her?

Everything that I think of doing only bores me even deeper.

ADHD,"I am a 28-year-old female who is diagnosed with ADHD as a child, with a few years of treatment. For all of my young adult and adult life, I’ve managed without medication. Don’t get me wrong, it has been hard at times, but I was able to manage fish in grad school, starting my first career, and getting married. The last few years, my ADHD has definitely been getting worse, or maybe it’s just living with someone who’s pointing at all out. I have serious trouble focusing, I like attention to detail, impulsivity, I have trouble following through on things and completing tasks and more. I Lack self-confidence as well. And on top of that I do have anxiety at baseline, generalized anxiety and some social anxiety. add in that I am a new mom, with a 10 week old at home, and battling lack of sleep, and hormones with all of my underlying emotions. My mental health has not been great lately. I definitely feel flat, and get overwhelmed easily. Luckily my baby is a fairly good baby, so it could be worse. My husband has continue to point out that my ADHD symptoms are worse, but I can’t help feel just depressed and anxious all the time. hard because my husband also has ADHD, and is treated. And he is in the medical field, so has a lot of knowledge. He’s determined that the root cause of all my problems as my ADHD, and that is what I need to treat first. I really am not sure the right thing to do, and I have a psychiatrist appointment booked. But even tonight, he asked me if I was given a choice what I would do, and I didn’t know.

I was friends with everyone because of my sense of humor. I never cared about how I looked, or maybe I did, but I was always confident no matter what. After 6 months on Vyvanse, I had lost 20 pounds. I am 5’4 and was originally 115 pounds. Then about a year later, my appetite came back and I gained it back. Well that’s when the eating disorders came. And the constant anxiety.

ADHD,"Hi guys, I need some advice. Over the pandemic I completely changed my lifestyle around. I was very very heavy set growing up and I frequented from 150-170 lbs throughout college (5'6F btw) and then I realized I wanted to make a change and started intense cardio and weight training exercises, while simultaneously keeping an extremely healthy diet (which was a struggle everyday) . I managed to lose about 25 lb from my start weight landing me in the 130 lb ratio. I recently started taking 30 mg vyvanse for ADHD and it is bringing back every ED thought I have ever had. I have frequently struggled with BED and this medication has helped immensely but I realize when I don't take it the BED thoughts come creeping back. My GW is 120 lb. I am not even sure if I am able to reach that with my frame but the vyvanse effects make it easier. I guess my advice would be how can I approach this from a healthy perspective? My trainer tells me to eat more in order to burn less but my ED and vyvanse tell me to eat less. What are your experiences with this drug? I am not abusing it because I actually do suffer from ADHD but I feel like I am abusing the appetite suppressant components. It is so much easier to not eat especially when suffering from bad body image thoughts, but I fear I will eventually gain the weight back when I stop taking it.Vyvanse and weightloss",1635386682,1365,256
ADHD,"Hi, I’ll try to put as much info as I can without making this too long.  son was diagnosed with ADHD at age 6, he is now 10. At age 7, he started Focalin XR (I think 10 mg). It wasn’t perfect but worked for a while. He would zone out sometimes. He lost weight- probably the worst side effect. He was a respectful student, eager to please. Pretty average academically (when on meds), does well in math. ocially awkward.  eventually tried adderall xr. The night after his second dose he went to his playroom to play video games at 2 am (something he has never done before and never since), he became frustrated with a game and smashed his remote into the tv, breaking the screen. Then he had a meltdown. I immediately stopped the adderall. He went back on focalin for a while.  he’s on Vyvanse. He was on 20 for a while, it was good while he was homeschooled during the pandemic. His work was either independent or one on one with me. Very little distraction. He went back to school and after a few weeks it became clear the vyvanse was not helping him. He told me he was struggling bc he couldn’t focus.  children are too loud. I got him headphones. He’s struggling staying seated. They gave him a sensory cushion to sit on. The school has been very helpful and responsive. His IEP is being developed.  Dr. and I decided to raise the dose to 30, he’s been on it about a week. First couple days were promising.  he told me “the meds are making him depressed, the sadness is overwhelming, and its not worth being able to focus. He will just try harder to focus.”  obviously broke my heart and I’m having serious guilt. I told him he’s not going to take it anymore and I will come up with a new plan. His Pedi and I also discussed Concerta. My Pediatrician did tell me that if we change meds again maybe a specialist would be in order.  going to keep him med free for at least a week to see how it goes. He forgot his med once when he was 8, and his teacher called me because he was running around and couldn’t stay seated. He’s two years older and this teacher is more understanding so I’m hoping it will go ok.  have also been calling a counseling place (for weeks), still having trouble finding someone who can see him. Not enough mental health professionals- too many struggling kids.  feel my son has moderate ADHD, but also anxiety, depression (possibly from meds), and he may have AD-level 1/Aspergers.  now that you know the situation I’m looking for advice.

I’ve always felt like something was wrong with my brain, but just chalked it up to general anxiety.

It's absolute garbage (to put it nicely) that so many of you have to fight with your doctors and pharmacies to get prescription treatment. You shouldn't have to do that, full stop.  have not had that experience. I'll explain why I'm telling you all this below.  went to one doctor, in my insurance network, recommended to me by my therapist. His main practice is addiction medicine, I am in recovery myself, and I had a frank conversation with him about my history of addiction and substance use, current sobriety, my ADHD symptoms, my life goals, my reason for seeking medication. First talk lasted about 45 minutes, and he sent me an ADHD assessment questionnaire. econd meeting was about a month later, he went over the assessment with me, and said ""looks like you got the thing, let's try you on a low dose of Vyvanse and see what happens."" About 30 minutes. Monthly 15 minute appointments for the first 3 months after that, within those first few months we upped the dose to just below the max and I stabilized.  then made a career change and left private practice. His physicians assistant took most of his clients (including me) to another addiction medicine clinic. We meet every 3 months and she sends 3 individual prescriptions to my pharmacy. he loves me as a client because I'm easy; I'm strong in recovery, my prescription is stable, and I'm just grateful to have a doctor willing to treat me.  the original doctor and now his old PA meet me exclusively via Telehealth. I've never had to actually go to the office. I meet them from my bedroom desk. If you live in the Mountain West part of the U, and you want to try them out, send me a DM and I'll let you know where they're at and give you their number if you're in state. You might be able to work with them without ever going in.  second time I went in to the Kroger pharmacy that's literally a block from my house, they told me I needed to do some online coupon thing to save some money on my prescription. They told me what to google, and then helped me find the numbers they needed to give me the discount. They are always pleasant with me, and aside from being perpetually short staffed and busy as hell they're great to me. Never once a comment or stink eye about my stimulant prescription. Always ""Here you go, have a nice day.""  writing this to encourage anyone who is considering seeking a diagnosis and treatment (whether prescription or otherwise) to PLEAE do so. You might have to try a few doctors; you might have to try a few pharmacies. It is worth it. Don't get discouraged before you even try by all the very true stories about shit doctors and pharmacies out there. You might find one of them on your first try and need to call another one. Or you might win the lottery like me and find someone who actually cares about helping you accomplish your goals and live your life to the fullest.  prescription did not solve all of my problems, and my life isn't rainbows and unicorns. But my CONTANT brain fog is gone since I started taking meds this spring. I still have a ton of executive dysfunction, and a lot of the same issues that I had before. My eyes still randomly unfocus and my brain goes blank for a minute, usually after my meds have worn off for the day. However my biggest benefit from meds is that when I finally decide to fold that laundry or write that paper, it hurts my brain so much less than it used to. I still need all the coping skills, life hacks, lists, reminders, etc. But my brain doesn't effing hurt so much anymore (now it's just my soul that's in constant pain 😎) are decent doctors and pharmacists out there.

But then it becomes so much I can bare it anymore and finally tell them how I feel about getting ghosted then result in them saying some excuse or I am not always going to talk to or something along those lines. I get annoyed and block them which resulted in almost all the girls in my grade 8 class not liking me. I tried a new approach were I just don’t make the joke about delivered (I think just it annoys them).

ADHD,"FF. I've been dealing with depression on and off since I was a child. My first few tries at antidepressants did nothing so I gave up on trying to get better and tried to just live with it. I had a baby in 2019 and decided to try again so I can be a better parent. I asked for Wellbutrin, having heard good things, and to my surprise it actually helped.  end up asking by doctor for a psych referral to get an assessment on my depression and the psych tells me I don't have major depressive disorder (I was diagnosed with this as a child), I have ADHD which has caused depression, but since the root cause is not depression by itself antidepressants typically don't work. He then tells me that it's interesting that I started Wellbutrin because it has been prescribed as a low dose treatment for ADHD, hence my improvement.  recommends ADHD meds and I go back to my GP for a follow-up. Only to be told I can't have ADHD, if I did I would have been diagnosed as a child (nevermind the fact that the psych told me women were frequently undiagnosed as children in the 90s). am on meds now and have seen MAIVE improvements but this comment has stuck with me and really brings to light the issues with getting diagnosed as an adult.My doctor ""You can't have ADHD, if you did you would have been diagnosed as a kid""",1635383888,1308,247
ADHD,"Maverick my 12 year old offered to hook up his old Xbox for his 4 year old brother Broderick earlier today. He found the disc's and the pad to his Disney Infinity got it hooked it all up and went upstairs to find the characters. I made the mistake of walking upstairs to get my phone charger. Now to normal people this isn't a mistake but to me, the girl who was starting dinner and had just put oil in a pan to heat up, it was a terrible mistake. I walked into Mavericks room to see how it was coming and ended up helping him find most of the characters, I didn't ask him to do any of this and I really appreciate what he's doing for his brother. o why not help right? Except I walked upstairs to quickly grab my phone charger while the oil heated up on the stove.  one point I said ""Get my charger and put it in the tote with the characters before I forget what I actually came up here for"". far too long I yelled DAMN IT HANDI there's oil on the stove. wasn't ""burning"" but it was turning color 🤦🏼‍♀️ that's how I almost burnt the house down.... are super fun, also this is always what happens when I set deadlines for myself.

I feel like boredom above everything has been a defining factor in my depression which to me seems like it would possibly point to being an ADHD issue.   have tried a few ADHD meds again a couple years back ( family doc prescribed ) but there was not any real guidance given and the meds that were taken didn't provide the expected results.  I've been debating about trying them again soon as kind of a process of elimination.   guess I just need help trying to figure out how people go about determining their ADHD?  Like if I showed up in a doctor's office I would imagine that I wouldn't be a ""typical"" ADHD person because I feel like depression has crushed a lot of my personality away.   me part of what makes an ADHD person is a person that has a high level of curiosity but an inability to maintain / control that curiosity.

I am now taking generic concerta 36mg after trying wellbutrin, strattera, and vyvanse. Concerta is by far the best and it has helped me so much already! I started it less than a week ago and i already put in job applications which is something i had been procrastinating since February. I want to keep taking the concerta but the main/ only side effect i get is loss of appetite/ nausea. I have a hard time eating even though i feel the physical side effects of hunger like headache and a stomach ache. Food is repulsive even my favorite foods. I know that this is very common. I have been tracking my calories in a fitness app and i eat between 800-1200 calories a day now. I am a little over weight and need to lose about 20 pounds to be a healthy bmi. I want to lose it in a healthy way and i know that I’m not eating enough calories (I’m 5’9). I read about a girl who had an ed and she used to take stimulants on an empty stomach and barely eat all day. he recovered but she said she has permanent nausea and stomach issues from doing that. I don’t have an ed but i can’t figure out how to eat more than a few bites of food even in the evening when the meds wear off.

ADHD,"Over the last few years I've occasionally come across ADD/ADHD stuff on the internet, and my internal response was ""yeah, that describes me pretty well."" and then moved on with my scrolling. It wasn't until recently I found myself down the rabbit hole after watching a video on one of my hobbies where they briefly touched on an issue they had because of their ADD, and I remember thinking ""wait, that's an ADD issue..?"". And from there I started reading more about other peoples experiences with ADD, uncovering more issues that I relate strongly to that I had no idea were symptoms of ADD. most of them were like I had written them myself, and forgot about it. ome made me laugh, as they made comments about how they developed a strong interest in Hydroponics and Photography and spent hundreds of dollars on them only to never eventuate. My hydroponics setup sits in it's box, along with hundreds of dollars of photography gear, in a room with all the other stuff I've bought for hobbies that I lost interest in shortly after starting them (calligraphy, cnc machines, trading cards, homebrewing, etc). tuff I'll never get rid of, because I tell myself one day I'll do it. (Happy 3 years to my CNC machine still unused..). realized that maybe I'm not as much of a shitty human as I thought, and there might be hope yet. o I booked in with my Dr to get a referral, worried what he might say, he gave me one. Hurdle 1 complete. I called the Dr.. ""end through your referral, if you're accepted you'll find out within the week but the first appointment won't be for 6 months"". pretty anxious. Realising that so many of my issues, that up until now I thought were just my shitty personality, could potentially be helped.. But.. I'm afraid that when the time comes to talk, I won't explain myself well enough. Or I'll be dismissed. know realistically, they're a professional that deals with ADD/ADHD patients all the time. urely they'll know. It's really hard not to think I have it, it makes perfect sense of everything (zoning out daily in conversations where they talk for more than 2 minutes, walking around the house in autopilot and putting whatever is in my hand in the most obscure spot, no sense of time, making up generic responses to ""how was your weekend?"" cause I literally can never recall what I did on the weekend, focusing on new hobbies but never finishing them, always missing deadlines, getting to the end of my easy work list and hitting a wall). know I should be open to the idea that I don't have it. But it's really difficult when I relate so hard to pretty much every post about those with it. Even as I write this I feel like a fraud, despite feeling 95% positive that I have it. not entirely sure what I expect from this.. I'm not one to write on reddit. Just feeling a bit overwhelmed I guess? Realistically all I can do is wait to see if I've been accepted for a consultation, and then wait the 6 months.

They explained it a bit further by saying I can have the symptoms but not the actual disorder because if I'm being enough of a functional human being then it's not technically a ""disorder"".  being said we haven't gotten into my personal concerns about my symptoms, we've talked a lot about anxiety and not much else, and the next session, we agreed, will just be me telling them about my own experience and why I think I have it. o who knows. The table could be completely turned in a week.  still, I feel like ""you're too smart/you're too successful"" is one of those things too many of us hear and the rest of us fear hearing. It sounds a little like ""you're not suffering enough or in the right ways by my metric to warrant me taking your concerns seriously"". It definitely felt a little crushing to experience it myself, after hearing about the same thing happening to others so many times, but I'm trying not to let it get me down.  successful but I'm also suffering and incredibly frustrated with my inability to stay focused and get tasks done with enough time left to literally just enjoy my life. It sucks to feel that way, try to find help, and then to feel like you're still not being seen.  anyways, to end this off in the best way possible: I'm keeping my head up high for now and I know that I deserve the best care I can get, and that I will get it eventually, with this therapist or another (and once again, it's too early to tell). And for my friends reading this, in case you needed to be reminded: **you know your brain better than anyone else**. Keep advocating for yourself. &lt;3new therapist I'm seeing for ADHD said they doubt I have it because I'm in the top 10% of my class",1635378914,2201,402
ADHD,"TLDR- American medical system sucks.  have had such stressful time with getting diagnosed and treated. Months of waiting to get initial evaluation and then seeing a Psychiatrist.

Well, I have a heart condition. o I had to get cardiac clearance from my cardiologist. 6 weeks of going back and forth. I took a letter and Ekg to cardio and finally Psychiatrist and Cardio talked. Cardio says he thinks I'd be fine but wont clear me. I ask nurse to Psychiatrist. Can I just take an informed risk anyway? he goes, ""yeah, that should be fine. I will let Psychiatrist know.""

ADHD,"[BBC Youtube video]( bias is leaving many women with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) undiagnosed, leading psychologists are warning.  The stereotype that ADHD affects only ""naughty boys"" means it is estimated tens of thousands of women in the UK are unaware they have the condition, and are not receiving the help they need.  Another factor leading to slow diagnosis is the fact that symptoms of ADHD in women tend to be more subtle than in men, meaning signs can be missed.  These women have shared their stories of their struggle to be diagnosed. a short post, that wasn't long enough, botted, can't remember what I said, hope a copy pasta from the video is ok.Why do some women wait decades for an ADHD diagnosis? - BBC News",1635378656,743,127

Went to renew at the end of the month, only to find out they no longer had a provider for my state.  I’m an adult. chedule an appointment as a new patient with a PCP. PCP flat out says “I don’t and won’t prescribe adults that kind of medication” after he questioned me about my personal, nothing medical, history.  he gave me an anxiety and depression questionnaire to fill out and bring back to him.   do I do now?

I answered the basic mental stuff before the appointment basically just as an update to records (still depressed guys, you don't have to make me do this lol) and then after the normal weight height stuff I answer basic nurse quesrtions about seeking a test, and then she hands me an old iPad with a bunch of adhd questions, and boy let me tell you, if those questions represent typical problems adhd people have then I am \*definitely\* cause I felt like I was acing that quiz, where my honest answer to almost every question was ""almost every day I have this problem"". Doctor came in later and basically after I described my focus and executive issues, he was like ""ok yeah we're putting you on Vyvanse today, this is how it works"". I was afraid I'd have to fight to convince him I wasn't wrongfully self-diagnosing. But either I'm textbook adhd or this guy's a good doctor, maybe both. Either way, feels good that it wasn't super stressful or that my experiences weren't discounted, I just wish he had listened when I mentioned it earlier on a depression med checkup. My heart goes out to those on this sub who get doctors with outdated or straight wrong ideas about adhd and deny you care. I hope you get it soon.

ADHD,"  might not be the right place to post but it's all I got rn. it off by saying I've had undiagnosed ADHD for years. It feels really fake to say that or to even mention it to friends but I came from one of those families that refused medication thinking that doctors were liars and pills would zombify children. Despite this I have 8 other siblings who half of which were diagnosed before my parents decided not to take us to a doctor anymore.  I'm 24, fresh out of college at a new job. Friend of mine who was undiagnosed for years finally got some medication and a diagnosis last year. he offered me some of her medication to try (mostly to encourage me to go to a doctor/make me take my ADHD seriously. I tried some, and it changed my life.  I really want to cry knowing how incredibly difficult my life has been the last decade when I started taking school seriously, and that I've had a problem this entire time. I had such rapid onset clarity, such a clean and less ""distracted"" less free flowing thought into any and everything when I was on it.  The next day I went back to normal and I cried. I've never taken my ADHD seriously, my siblings who are into their adulthood have been talking to me about it now encouraging me to chill out a bit until I can go see a doctor and get a diagnosis.  I'm gonna be real with you, waiting 2 weeks from now to go to a doctor feels like hell. I am fighting off such a depressive episode just for the sake of starting my new job tbh. I'm so fucking angry at my parents for never taking this seriously. I could have felt like, OK for most of college had I had medication. so sad. I can't believe I felt ""human"" for the first time in my life from a pill I bummed off of a friend. I just want to feel normal again I want to cry.  I have all my housemates home right now so I'm trying to stave off bawling like a baby over this but jesus christ the rage and sadness I feel about this is disgusting.

ADHD,"hello! I'm new here so feel free to ask any questions or redirect me or anything you think may help as I'm kinda just going to share my story.  really quite struggling. moved around a lot as a kid. I was always really gifted. traight As always till basically college. Always had an insane amount of energy and struggled a bit to sleep.  Funny enough my mom is actually a special ed teacher and she suspected I had some ADHD symptoms but because my grades were always good she didn't see the need to seek help. My main ""symptoms"" as a child that I remember of was just being really energetic, restless and being completely unable to handle my emotions at times; i.e. excessively crying at certain times, excessively laughing at inappropriate things, excessive talking, and lots and lots of dreaminess in the classroom. It hurts me to think that I still managed to do so well in school and could've probably done even better if I had had some sort of help, though perhaps I truly didn't need it then. mom was always quite strict w me academically and the pressure was insane, though I myself was quite competitive and liked doing well.  In high school I overworked myself to death. I would wake up at 6am (school would start at 730) to volunteer at my school's library, then I had class (I was taking IB and AP level courses), after school I would go to academic clubs and after clubs I would go to track practice which was intense AF and lasted about 3hours every day. Then I'd go home and do homework till bedtime, when I'd often struggle to sleep. The strict routine that I was following those 4 years allowed me to stay focused. I struggled a bit with procrastination, impulsivity the few times I hung out w friends, and dreaminess but managed to do well enough to get into an ivy-league. all hell broke loose. I struggled w drugs, partying, cheating on my boyfriend and a crazy toxic relationship w him, depression, and even got arrested for shoplifting. They diagnosed me with bipolar and I took lithium for some years. I somehow still managed to graduate w an honors degree, though looking back at my grades I only did well in my passion (and major), which is literature and did poorly in all the other stuff. till, I had a degree of structure then since I lived w friends who had a similar schedule and I had a job I had to show up to and my boyfriend to keep me grounded. covid happened. I went back home w my parents and matured immensely. I got over partying, reckless sex, drugs, etc. (and still am over those now), and opened a youtube channel. I realized I didn't need my bipolar meds and that I was probably misdiagnosed. I wasn't happy at all because I was home for 1.5 years without a life but I evolved as a person. till, I struggled with impulsive spending (my biggest struggle in college also), lack of consistency on youtube, and lack of focus in school (procrastinating lots but blaming it on the pandemic).  thing; I am consistently late. I have not been on time to ANYTHING in god knows how many years. I mean that; it is not something I even try to work on anymore. I am not on time to class, work when I had one, dates, friends hang outs-- nothing. It's like I don't know what time is.  the pandemic eased, I came to Paris (from home in the U) to do my master's degree. I have no interest in doing the immature shit that was ruining my life in college but all hell has broken loose in another way. For the first time in my life I am living completely alone; no parents, no friends, no boyfriend. Just me. the past three months I have blown up all my savings. I am going home to the U tomorrow for a week since I have a school break and have no clue how I will manage to pay rent when I come back. I haven't shown up to class. All I've done is spend money and walk around Paris. I've had 0 structure. For the first time ever I've stopped working out and put on weight. I've been quite happy but it is only because I've been literally living a dream (wandering all day, reading, writing, meeting people, buying expensive things) Idk how I thought this could go on forever.... blew up the money I had saved for some laser treatments on a single pair of balenciaga sneakers. I blew up the money I had for my flight home in December too. I haven't posted to my youtube at all. It sounds so insane now that I am typing it and just don't know how I got here. My thought process always goes along ""it's fine, I'll figure it out later."" I've come to the conclusion that I cannot say no to myself. Truly. If I want something there's nothing I can do about it. I'm an actual slave to my emotions and have no concept of time.  am especially hurt because I am truly such a special person (not to sound conceited but hear me out). I am so smart. I don't even go to class or do the assignments and am doing better than most of my friends. I am super creative. I have such good ideas all the time and I dream of being self-employed and doing well on youtube. I am also quite charismatic and good-looking. I meet people--celebrities even--quite often here and befriend them easily. It pains me so much that I have all this potential and dreams of living a great life and impacting others and that I am so stuck. Unable to move forward or discipline myself in any way.  symptoms of restlessness and lack of concentration/dreaminess (except on the things that interest me) have never gone away , by the way. reached out to my mom about it. I didn't tell her the full story (aka she does not know at allll the severity of it all; she doesn't know that I miss class, that I've spent all my money, etc.) But I told her I was struggling to focus. My brother walked into the convo and told me to make calendars, to-do lists, etc. They definitely minimized the situation and simply made it sound like I am lazy and unmotivated and for the longest time I thought this was the case too, which has greatly impacted my self-esteem.  decided not to tell them anymore and have requested an appointment w my school therapist though that will take some time. I still have a bit of an impostor syndrome and think that maybe I really don't have adhd just like I didn't have bipolar, but it's at the point where my life is severely impaired and I need some sort of help. I have a strong will to get better, so for that I'm grateful. this is so long, I really have no one to tell this to, but I'd appreciate any support or comments.  long but really struggling, please help",1635376750,6460,1213

ADHD," Let me start by saying this; I haven't been diagnosed with ADHD. That being said, I am curious if I have it. I was always a good student in school, (well beside barely doing homework or forgetting stuff all the time, or procrastinating with everything). I was called lazy for not doing my homework or slacking off (I know I'm not I've had a job since I was 15 and moved out on my own at 18) Now that I have been out of school for a few years and am farther into adulthood and social media has developed, I have notice things about ADHD that seem to resonate with me. Usually symptoms that I'm like ""hey I do that"" or something that fits me. I noticed that I could play a video game that required lots of multitasking for hours, but then a simple thing like writing a list of groceries was just not worth my brain energy. I didn't really think about the possibility of having it until my /O said it jokingly and I looked more into it. As I have looked more into it I've been skeptical (because you know, Google) but I do think its something I should talk to my doc. about. My whole thing about it is I don't want to feel like its something I'm striving to have I guess its more like I'm looking for validation? Like so many thing would make sense if someone said yes you do those things because of XYZ? Idk I guess I feel lost and looking for answers. o my long winded questions is did anyone else feel lost before they were diagnosed? Or feel like if they were told no that they would feel like an imposter for thinking that was the cause?

ADHD,"Hi, Everyone! I hope you are all well. I'm writing wondering if it's worth it for me to get tested. I'm pro-meds and pro-therapy, I just don't know if it will benefit me specifically. I am as certain as I can possibly be as a non-doctor that I would be diagnosed as someone with ADHD. I exhibit enough to warrant a diagnosis, but I also function pretty well. I'm a 32 year old female teacher and am damn good at my job. I've had it for 11 years. I am not worried about losing it.  am currently taking Lexapro and Wellbutrin for anxiety and depression. My anxiety is in a fabulous place right now. My depression is not. I'm extremely tired all of the time. That is also because I'm also grieving the loss of my mother. Perhaps that is making me pay more attention to everything related to ADHD in my life. Everything is 400% harder to accomplish when I am grieving. Being over-stimulated easily certainly doesn't help.  is my first year back in the classroom after teaching virtually for a year and a half. I forgot how constantly stimulated I was. Little kids are amazing, but they are not patient. They ask questions when I'm talking to other people already. They make all sorts of noises. It's really distracting! ometimes I wanna pull all my hair out. This is all normal, and was definitely distracting before, but I think I'm noticing it more because teaching on Zoom is pretty darn different. Plus, the kids are all a mess due to the lack of structure for the past year and a half. They have to learn how to ""do school"" again. (not knocking em, I know it's normal... But that doesn't make it easier for me!)  how much I am distracted makes me wonder if it's worth exploring. I get crap done. I'm stubborn and work my butt off to reach my goals. I find myself in the hyper-focus/flow mode often enough that I can perform tasks needed to survive (work, cooking, hygiene, taking care of my pets, etc.). I think I have pretty good coping mechanisms. My mom taught me so many things as a kid that really helped. But I'm exhausted and cry on weekends because I feel like all I can do is recover on the couch. I'm not doing things I like because I'm too over stimulated to be able to. I'm not feeling rested after sleep. I forget what I'm saying while I'm saying it sometimes. Managing time is hard for me. I have no sense of it. I lose my phone every damn day. I binge eat.

ADHD,"First, if I'm not posting this in the right place, I really am sorry. I am pretty new to Reddit and still trying to figure it out. 😅 I'm not really sure where to start and I'm sure I'll ramble, but since elementary I have always done really well in school, and had extreme anxiety. To the point I'd be having anxiety attacks almost every morning on the bus from worrying I forgot to do homework or forgot it at home. And if I did end up forgetting it, I would have a panic attack in class, to which the teacher would just send me to the bathroom to calm down. I always felt different, but then decided this just must be how it is for everyone and I just suck at handling it.  forward to college and suddenly I am not doing well at all. I was valedictorian in high school, how am I doing so poorly?? o the end of my first college semester I told my mom I wanted to talk to the doctor about migraines (which I do get), but really to talk about anxiety. At my appointment I try to bring it up but start hyperventilating and swinging my hands to try and breathe, and scared my poor doctor. o at age 18 I started on antidepressants/anxiety meds. For the next few years my PCP would try different medications because nothing seemed to be having much impact. I gained a lot of weight and really just lost myself. My PCP suggested I go to the free counseling center on my college campus but for some reason I couldn't get myself to go. finally graduate and get my first ""big girl"" job. I loved it, got promoted, then my job hopping began. In the past three years, I've had six jobs. Each one I loved at the beginning and slowly got tired, bored, restless, whatever you want to call it. At one of my jobs, I worked at a mental health center and my office neighbor was a therapist and suspected I had ADHD, because 1. he was a therapist, 2. he was an intelligent woman who also had ADHD. My PCP wasn't too fond of prescribing a controlled substance so I had a low dose, extended release ADHD med. But it was too expensive because insurance stuff I don't understand. o I just kind of gave up.  2019, my brother got sick, and that prompted me to get serious about therapy. I was 23 at the time and found a therapist with an opening. he agreed that ADHD was a possibility but wanted to rule out bipolar and others. Also, I would have to go to a psychiatrist. I found a psychiatrist and she said I would have to do four hour testing. Excuse me? FOUR hours?  then covid came around and everything kind of got pushed to the back. I quit therapy and my psychiatrist was switching positions. I was doing okay-ish but everything kept piling up. I could feel a huge breakdown coming. I make myself get back into med management, she suggests (encourages) therapy as well. My therapist is like ""oh, yea, definitely ADHD and unfortunately with how severe yours is, not much is going to improve until we get meds."" Which would usually make me a little hesitant but she's the type to really want to exhaust all options before going straight to meds. he puts in a referral and a month later I'm going to my four hour testing.  have no idea what to expect, I'm nervous, I just want to cry and quit. It gets started and it's actually not that bad. Kind of fun. I hate talking about this, because I don't like bragging about myself but I truly am not bragging. But the tester (doctor) just keeps saying things like ""holy shit"" and other surprised phrases. I was like ""oh no, it's horrible, I'm doing this all wrong and he's amazed someone could mess it up so bad."" The next day we have our follow up and he's like ""so, you don't have ADHD, but you are in the 99th percentile for your group in IQ."" And honestly I am so hard on myself I would have been disappointed if it didn't come back high. He said one part I missed one pattern one and the only person he test that got them all right was an engineer of some type. And the only person to do better on spitting a story back at him was a news reporter whose job it was and had years of practice and mine was just my natural talent. After he finished I just broke down in tears and asked what was wrong with me then.  feel so crappy because everyone is like congratulating me and saying how great that is. But to go for so long to feel like something is different about yourself, to feel like you struggle more than most at some basic things. And what does having an official statement of me being smart bring me? I felt so defeated and hopeless.  continue with therapy, but I felt like we were getting nowhere, and it seemed my therapist was a little disappointed, too. But then yesterday I had an appointment and she tells me the doctor added ADHD diagnosis. he already talked to my psych nurse about starting ADHD meds. he seemed really hopeful and positive. I still felt really nervous for today (my psych nurse appt). I was so scared it would start and she would tell me it was a mistake and I don't have ADHD. But, no, she talked to the doctor, I do have ADHD, inattentive type. I just have to have a drug test and EKG and then she can prescribe meds.  don't even know if this has a point. I've just been so overwhelmed, and feel so relieved, but still so scared. I kind of feel like the testing doctor was preoccupied with my IQ that he missed my ADHD? Or thought I was too smart to have ADHD even though that's not how that works? But I am thankful he revisited it.  you've read this far, thanks. If you have any advice, different perspectives, anything, I'm open. I still feel so lost as it's still sinking in.Diagnosis Rollercoaster",1635374917,5563,1058
ADHD,"hort background: I have had a history of chronic anxiety throughout my life. But it was exacerbated because within a short time frame I had a very, very ugly break up, my mom died suddenly, and I was diagnosed with stage 1 cancer. have been taking mood stabilizers for years and generally my baseline is sad but manageable with some days being worse than others. I am still dealing with health issues from cancer related treatments so my mood is dependent on how I feel physically some days. I am in the last year of my PhD and having issues starting my dissertation. When I was 13 I was diagnosed with ADHD but treating with meds ended when I ""matured and started to doubt the diagnosis (this was the early 90s). Without meds I was able to get into a highly competitive graduate program and have managed websites for a large company... But lately I lost all motivation and became very depressed due to anxiety episodes due to past trauma. My psychiatrist and I decided that we should try to treat my ADHD again as it may be causing my racing anxious thoughts and resultant depression. have been on slow release Concerta for 2 weeks now and I am declining into an emotional mess. I am very angry, not eating (feel sick), and crying profusely about situations that have happened in the past. I deeply dread they will happen again. I am hyper focusing on negative things that have happened in the past to the point I am unable to work on new projects out of fear. I am so stressed that I am completely shutting down and laying in bed all day. anyone else experienced this? I am supposed to be upping the medication amount every week but currently I am so upset that I can't get out of bed or leave my place.  if there are typos. I am on my phone and shaking from stress.

ADHD,"Hello all, am not really sure what I'm asking, really. But basically, a while back my psychiatrist asked me if I had ADHD or if I had interest in being evaluated for it. ure, I'll get evaluated. And so I followed through and several weeks later I have been diagnosed with ADHD inattentive type. But I still don't really know what that means for me... I saw the same doctor to be evaluated for Autism. And I have another appointment or two for that. My doctor said that after we finished that he would schedule a final appointment to go over coping techniques and to talk about what these things mean for me. I guess I'm impatient cause that will likely be about 2 months away with how busy his schedule is. But honestly, I don't know understand why I am standing here. I know I can google what ADHD means. I'm currently listening to the 30 Essential Ideas in the sidebar. But, I guess I just don't get it yet. Because when I last talked to my doctor he asked me if my psychiatrist had prescribed me medication yet. My psychiatrist appointment was 2 days after that one, I hadn't talked to him yet. When I finally talked to my psychiatrist, he hadn't been given my diagnosis yet so when I asked about it he saw it and said ""Oh. I hadn't checked it yet. But now that I see it I will look it over and we can talk about it at our next visit."" That's in 4 weeks. And I'm scared because I trust my doctor and psychiatrist, but I don't understand. I suppose I will ask both my doctor and psychiatrist what it means when I talk to them next, but I am stewing over and need someone to explain it to me. maybe?: Could someone please point me towards something that is easily digestible that will clearly explain what ADHD is so I can try to make sense of what that means for me? anyone else feel this way when they were first diagnosed? I honestly feel like I'm going crazy. But I think it's also my fault for not asking first off ""Why do you think I have ADHD?"" when my psychiatrist first mentioned it. love,Diagnosed a few weeks ago.

ADHD,"As a kid I (M16) guess I was naturally stimulated by everything; energised and enthusiastic about learning and always the type to ask questions. Everyone thought I was a gifted kid and most still do, but for the past 2 years, I've suspected be having ADD at least. I've struggled emotionally, maintaining friendship circles, suffering constant social anxiety (which I am now rid of), and other obvious ADHD stuff that I would only know about because of this sub. After months of being on the NH waiting list, I was told by 3 separate professionals (2 mental health professionals, 1 GP) I have all the correlating symptoms and I should try and get a diagnosis. Fast forward a few repetitive meetings and overall poor communication between my family and CAMH, my dad got a phone call today basically saying that CAMH have spoken to my school and I cannot be tested for a diagnosis for ADHD because I went through secondary school no problem. I asked why I can literally not function in class and can't sit down to do work before I want to do literally anything else or nothing at all, they said it must be anxiety driving me nuts and I should get a letter soon about how to deal with it; I broke down on the phone right there. I only got through school because anxiety kept me from failing and I cared so much about school that I had panic attacks before meaningless class tests which forced me to learn at least a little bit. I revised for my maths, physics and geography GCE's the night before and day of and got a 9 (A++) in each. I read on this sub I might be twice-exceptional but how do I communicate that to someone on the phone who thinks I only have bad anxiety and refused to listen to any rebuttal I had about me being bored in lessons and having to teach myself the entire specification at home the night before the exam? Is it even possible to get diagnosed anymore? Or is there another factor to it I'm missing and I genuinely am just lazy?

I was returning the stuff, I couldn't remember how I had paid for it and forgot the receipt at home, so I felt kind of dumb.

I was wracking my brain for a full 6 minutes just standing there trying to remember what I needed.

ADHD,"Allow me to start with a brief history of me, ADHD, and ADHD medication, TL:DR at end went my entire grade school career undiagnosed. I believe this was a mix of two factors: 1) My parents were very hesitant to get me tested because my older brother was previously diagnosed and had a bad experience with his meds (turned him into a zombie apparently) and 2) Because of my natural intelligence and genuine interest in most of my school material, I did pretty well in school growing up. till, was never a student to study, complete homework, or really even acknowledge that school exists outside of classtime.  came to bite me in the butt in college when all of a sudden class time alone became a lot less valuable proportionately, and the subject material in my classes was less engaging for me for whatever reason. After 2 years of hell, I finally realized that I had ADHD and that was why I was so incapable of motivating myself to work hard. Wasn't long after that I found a local psychiatrist to diagnose me and soon thereafter I was on meds.  first meds were non stimulants, which did very little for me. After a couple months, i was then put on 10mg of Ritalin. Again after a month, I complained to my psychiatrist that I truly wasn't feeling any difference. He reluctantly put me on 20mg, adding ""we can't keep increasing your dose forever tho"".  my disappointment, my main results of my medication was just a slightly more depressed mood and  a sharp decline in appetite. I had occasional bursts of energy/motivation, but always felt like I was only motivated to prove the drug was working, not because it actually was. The lack of appetite was also a major concern, as I've struggled with being underweight my whole life and being able gain muscle mass with relative ease is very important for me, and that requires stuffing myself every day. I lost weight very quickly in the few months i was stimulants.  my 20mg refill ran out, I never called for a new one. ee, on a few days I had experimented and double, even triple dosed myself at times. till felt very little, and ultimately came to the conclusion that the cons of the medication outweigh the pros.  core of my question is this: for someone with ADHD as bad as mine, and coping mechanisms as bad too, is it even realistic to think I could ever lead a functional life without being hopped up on meds? I really do appreciate many aspects of my ADHD brain, it makes me witty and outgoing socially and also creative when I'm to myself. I really would love to be able to keep my ADHD and only fix the very worst of it. Is it at least a little common for people with very bad ADHD to still conquer it on their own / without meds? Or am I going to have to deal with a hard pill to swallow?

ADHD,"Hey there, fellow procrastinators, the past month, I've recently started a journey to learn software development. I need a project to work on while I study and take online courses, and I realized today that a great way I can do this is through creating an ADHD app! There's only a handful on the iPhone app store, and they don't seem very effective at all to me. It's mostly ""Here, remember to write down your routines and stick to them! We'll send you a notification to remind you!"". They seem to be made by non-ADHD people that think that they can solve our problems by creating a daily planner that simply yells at you when you don't open it enough. My mission statement for this app would be ""An app made by someone with ADHD *for* people with ADHD"". want to know about the solutions that you have implemented in your lives that have *actually* become a concrete foundation of your day-to-day life, instead of hyperfocusing and sticking to it for two weeks and then inevitably forgetting about it. example, I love sticky notes. Whenever I have a new deadline or a task I need to complete, I scribble it down on a sticky note and stick it on the wall. I was thinking this app could have a section where it's basically just a digital bulletin board for sticky notes that you can carry around in your pocket throughout the day. would love to hear your input (anyone and everyone) because I really do want to make this app for you guys. I read through this subreddit every day and laugh to myself about how similar we all are and I genuinely want to help us all become the best versions of ourselves possible. are some questions I'd like you to consider: What is the most effective tool/way for you to succeed with ADHD? (Bullet journal, sticky notes, calendars, or maybe you created your own system!) What features (big or small)  would you love to see in an ADHD app?

I’m not so sure if this one is also the adhd thing or is it possible that I actually had some sort of learning disorder all this time.   is this somewhat common with ADHD or not so?Is this an ADHD thing?,1635371316,577,108

ADHD,"TL;DR at the bottom. I'm sorry if this kind of post isn't allowed. 20F if that matters.    I'm not even sure where to start with this. I've rapidly found that college is not for me. I've tried twice to ""test the waters"" of community college classes, starting with just two ""fun/simple"" classes each time. I got kicked from three out of the four because I couldn't keep up. It was essentially a repeat of my experience in middle school and high school.    I also quickly realized that tons of entry-level occupations are just. Too. Loud. I may not have a breakdown on the job every single day, but long-term it sounds like an absolute sensory nightmare, and I'd definitely become a ticking time bomb for a breakdown eventually. A lot are also number-oriented (ex. cashiering), and I'm dyscalculic (""math dyslexic"").     I looked into apprenticeships and trade schools, but damn, if I can't even pass ONE college class thanks to my ADHD, is that even realistic...?  In the instance it's NOT like college and will be fine, there's, again, lots and lots of extremely loud options (hair dryers, dental drills, construction drills, blenders and kitchen noises, etc.).    I'm rapidly alternating between ""I need to get over it and just do it!!!"" (which I know won't work) and, ""The entire world is literally designed against me and I'm destined to just lie down and die"".     *I need help.* I need leads, I need college alternatives, or ideas, or just-- I don't even know where to continue looking because I've already looked in some places and I'm just hitting dead ends.I'm literally disregarding and throwing away the dreams of all my interests (biology/entomology, illustration/comics) just to find OMETHING I can ACTUALLY work with. Anything. eriously anything.    *I am just so desperate. I need ANYTHING right now.* Even just hope.  if anyone else has ideas as to where else I can ask/look for college alternatives (even completely disregarding the sensory issues), please let me know. I figured to ask here first since I know ADHD can come with sensory issues like mine.    orry this is so long. ADHD + auditory hypersensitivity + dyscalculia makes just one (1) college class impossible, and shoots down almost all job leads. Looking for options that aren't college, and/or looking for job ideas that aren't too loud. Extremely desperate.A literal cry for help; in DESPERATE need of leads for college alternatives, sensory-friendly jobs, ANYTHING.

ADHD,"I've gotten my diagnosis a few months ago, and am slowly starting to learn what this means to me. One thing I've been noticing is that it's really hard for me to regulate my emotions. This most often happens when my partner(s) aren't there, and I slide into thoughts like ""see, they don't love me"". Or when I'm not included in a conversation, which makes me think ""see, I don't belong anywhere"".  are very strong emotions, and lead to some very difficult times. I'm trying to tackle this with a therapist with ACT, but that takes a lot of time and effort. I was wondering if someone here has tips and/or tricks that have helped them deal with stuff like this.  already seen the suggestion to make some post-it notes (or other reminders) that remind me of when I _did_ feel loved, or _did_ make me feel included.

ADHD,"o yesterday I forgot to take my meds, which is normally terrible just because obv school stuff. I was doing surprisingly decent, but it felt off from the last/other times I forgot my meds. I don’t really know how to describe the first part. After school ~7, the feeing I had was amplified a bit and I started feeling significantly different mentally, but not totally different. I went on a game with my friends but left after 10 minutes because one of them kept on laughing at me getting mad over a bunch of small things. then started messaging a few of my IRL friends and was being irrationally mad and I felt like they played a part in me feeling this way even though I know they didn’t. I really cannot phrase how I felt very well during this time, but i’ll leave screenshots of the conversation in the comments. I think there is a possibility I might have BPD. I am only 14, so I am aware that it isn’t that likely or that it’s just in my head. I know I am not the type of person to fake mental illness, I’ve been diagnosed with ADHD/ADD since I was seven and hate people acting like it’s quirky and fine, because it’s not an ok thing. Again, I still know that I am 14 and I could just be jumping to conclusions, but stuff like this has happened before and i e been thinking about it a lot now. I am not considering this to be equivalent to a diagnosis, or any form of validation, I am just looking for insight.I need insight on something that happened",1635370170,1456,279
ADHD,"Hello I’m a 20 something male here. Recently I had been suffering from depression and anxiety for a couple of months. I also have adhd, but my psychiatrist wanted to treat the depression and anxiety first. Eventually I convinced him to put me on focolin (can’t spell sorry). He said that even with clients with adhd he gives them focolin as an adjunct to depression medicine. I just started today, but I feel a difference. It can still be hard for me to do one thing, pick a video to watch and all that, but I don’t feel the negative feelings that I had before. I feel oddly a bit my energies, confident, happy, like I want to do things. People say medicine isn’t magic and I’m of course gonna continue with therapy and other stuff, but like wow.

ADHD,"I am here on the quest for information regarding my 6 year old daughter. I read every similar post word was just as I am currently especially down to the new behaviour from a girl who is beautifully behaved so I am looking for advice on how to go forward, especially want to hear what you would have liked to happen as a child I have always wanted to 'raise adults not children' as I say because they will be adult longer than children. If I'm going about this wrong I really appreciate advice especially if am I genuinely want to know the stuff that may be hard to hear. personally am trying to deal with the behaviour by rightly or wrongly assuming she has ADHD and trying to find better ways to order our life around ways things work for her we've already got a tasks board so she can have a picture of things to when she needs to do a task i.e a coat picture when she needs to get coat on, which has been a god send for the week. And constantly reminding myself she works differently to me it's not something she even knows she is doing, which when she runs through the house after she just hurt herself an hour ago and I tell her not to constantly, or making sure I have them time and patience to sit through talking through things when something needs multiple sentences to understand and trying to keep things short, we even just sing the main words in a sentence because helps her remember it better. Either way these things help her so they will stay, but her out bursts are definitely more extreme and I've noticed but I have noticed the last few days that changing words and explaining things multiple ways help like she needs certain words to understand, (one example being her dad wanted a yes no answer to ""do you ever sit in the front of nannies car"" and she couldn't give a yes/no answer to that but after multiple attempts and gets stressed that she doesn't understand ""have you ever sat in the front of nannies car"" and she answered straight away) I have come to see that for  whatever reason she doesn't see the world the way I do and I'm going to have to learn with her how I can make our world work for her. It's definitely a struggle as it's like she speaks a language neither of us know and I can see she is starting to get upset sometimes that she doesn't get things. am making these changes as I think if it helps her it's happening at home but I am due to have the conversation with school next week and I don't know where that will go, she started a new school a month ago, and we struggled with getting heard at her last school, this was before I fully looked into adhd and it just clicked, now her old school said she was just behind due to missed class time due to covid, I could see she could focus on some things and others she would just miss or do one thing then never complete work I know she can do as I helped her through homeschool and I saw she needs constant breaks and tools/rewards to keep focus but they didn't take in my concerns because she never caused trouble and asked for help, and basically hid her struggling from the class. o any ideas how I get her new school to listen because I see her missing out on learning just because she loses focus when it gets boring or she has to listen for long or giving up when she gets something wrong.  also need help on how to get her dad on side with actually being proactive about this basically her dad has had so many comments that people with ADHD think he's possible to have it but he won't get tested, I'm not even sure if he's going to support her getting tested, he hates labels and thinks they make people weak as where I think it empowers them. I hope he can support her he doesn't stop the ways I've changed her home life but he doesn't do them constantly we are not together so I need him to take part. did getting diagnosis help, I'm not saying I never will and if I need to push for school to support I will but is it enough to make amendments to help her world work for her I don't want to put her on medication just to fit into everyone else's world I believe the world should fit everyone in not the other way round so medication we've tried to make it her world too and it's still causing her too much stress. o does she need to go through diagnosis.  for any advice givenHow to approach ADHD with a child that shows traits",1635369785,4329,835

ADHD,"I make things monochrome because I can't tolerate ambiguity. All the expectations I have are formed based on a mind obsessed with categorisation. Everything outside my mind seems perfect. Absolute. People are smart or they aren't. Competent or they aren't. Winners or losers. Like when cheesy romance stories end and you're just left with ""well, I guess they literally lived happily ever after"". That's what my mind does. There's no nuance, no individuality outside of me. I have a bizarre obsession with not making full judgements about anyone for anything, or trying not to. It's a desire to be seen as complex and deep masquerading as ""oOoh look at ME, I take nothing at face value because I'm sPeCiAl and iNtElLigEnT"". If I can't meet this imaginary standard of perfection I have, I'm not worth my time. If maintaining routine, working out, performing exceptionally academically, being mindful, avoiding addiction/bad habits, seeming the ""smart one"" in conversation and looking good all the time doesn't come as easily to me as it does to fictional characters, I'm not worth it.  don't know when I became so ridiculously disconnected from any regular thought process, but that's how I am.

ADHD,Been having problems getting my script due to shortages. Didn't want to run out so cold turkeyed it today. Didn't feel great. Went skateboarding and when I mean that I mean full on shirt drenched in sweat trick skateboarding. I take it very seriously and the dex has helped since I started 2 years ago. Anyways I got to the skatepark feeling blah. Warmed up and skated hard 45 mins hoping to create some natural endorphins (which I barely have). Felt a bit better. Went to a spot next to a mall with a good ledge expecting to get kicked out quick so I was the Tasmanian devil just back to back working on a trick I was filming.  No kick out but tired myself out and was soiled in sweat. Had about a 30 minute drive home and felt back to normal.  For context I wake up early 630 and take meds then all at once even though they should be spread out but anyways I think a lot of it is mental.  I'm sitting in bed watching a movie feeling 100%. Is this the calm before the storm.  From what I read the 1st couple days are the worst. I just heard people with nightmare stories and I am at a loss as to why but at the same time I've detoxed off heavy opiates several times which make Amp withdrawal nothing. Not planning on taking any tomorrow and playing it by ear. But the shortage I guess is real because I can't even get dex which supposedly isn't very common. Not like Adderall at least.

It was really cool having a good social life for some time in syllabus week, too! 😂 classes started though…  started not being able to be with my friends nearly as often. Even though that somewhat took a toll, it hasn’t been too bad. I’ve basically been in a cycle of spending days catching up on HW and days trying to put back together my social life… the forgetfulness I experience has caused me to have to deal with lots of damage control. For example, tomorrow I have to go to a car wash and spend $80 for them to detail my interior. I need to do this because I left my car windows down all night and it rained… - I almost lost a whole load of clothes because I was going on a retreat for the weekend and didn’t give myself enough time to take them out.- I have missed whole assignments because, even though I did it on time and put my best efforts in, I ended up submitting the wrong assignment.- I forgot to take a whole exam and another huge assignment in this class which led me to have to explain to the professor how I forgot to take an exam he had open for a week..- I am stuck with a roommate who I really wish I didn’t have because I forgot to keep contact with a better roommate candidate at orientation. - the list goes on… this week has probably been one of the worst weeks I’ve had in a while. - To get out of an exam I had not prepared enough for, I went to the doctor to get a note so I could take the test another time. - I studied so much for this exam but my study skills aren’t good and I ended up getting a worse grade than my last exam which I barely studied for and was supposed to be harder than the second one 71-&gt;68).-  I feel like I’m losing touch with many friends and haven’t been able to see much of them at all- ince I skipped all my classes this week, I’m going to have to spend tons of time catching up- On top of all this; I have to watch a movie for one of my classes and write up some notes on it, I have to finish a huge psychology research paper, I have to finish a paper that was due almost two weeks ago, I have to finish a few other smallish assignments, and then also start studying for any other exams coming up.  outside of my schoolwork, I have to worry about going to the gym, church stuff (RCIA/retreat leader stuff), work, trying to maintain a social life, preparing to leave for Florence, Italy for three months next semester…. be honest, I’m so exhausted right now.

Or when a subject I'm studying just takes over my mind and I become a machine, learning weeks worth of content in a night. problem is, when I can't find the switch to turn on that focus for whatever I need to get done. It's like majority of the time the thought of doing those tasks is agony and I know I'm going to be fighting for my life if I try to attempt them. I'll be using so much mental strain to stay on task and only able to work at the slowest possible pace and overall have a bad bad time. o why would I sign up for that when the wave of motivation and drive could strike at any moment making me actually *want* to do the thing effortlessly. results though, is potentially a week or more where I'm in limbo like waiting for ""the mood"" to come, just doing nothing and achieving nothing and becoming more stressed because I know that the longer time goes the less likely I'm going to suddenly switch on to the task. I can try the little tricks to try help it along but no guarantee it will work. And don't even get me started on the times it does come but you're accidentally doing the wrong activity and now you can't stop.  like having a sports car but the accelerator just goes on it's own randomly so you might just be rolling all the way to your destination when you could've ridden a bike there faster, but maybe you zoom there in record time without the effort of biking, who knows?   **hyperfocus is annoying**   **why would I do the thing today when I feel** ***meh***  **when tomorrow I might feel** ***zoom***  **so I'm just waiting all the time**The whole ""hyperfocus"" software we all came pre-installed with is great and all but really buggy.",1635366159,2030,381

ADHD,"New to this forum even though it’s long overdue.  was recently diagnosed with ADHD (Male 35) from my therapist but as he’s not a psychiatrist, he isn’t able to prescribe any medication. I’ve been at the end of my rope, having just recently lost a job due to a lack of performance. A job I could do and did enjoy but just could push through the activation energy needed to start and then the focus to finish projects. It all makes so much more sense now. Yet, I’m still where I started without any medication to help out. The tools learned from my therapist have helped but not to the degree I was hoping for.  story short, does anyone know of any programs/services that may help me out? uch as a separate service that can diagnose/prescribe?

ADHD,"I'm stuck in a life that's unfulfilling. There's so many things I'd like to do and habits I'd like to have, but I can't bring myself to do them. The effort required to build the life I want seems insurmountable. I want a clean apartment I simply need to clean a little bit each day. When I take something out I should be able to put it back. When the dishwasher's clean I should empty it, and then put the dirty dishes inside after I use them. When I take a shower I should put my clothes right into the hamper.  examples are endless and I could expand them far outside the apartment.  little consistencies feel impossible though. I'll be able to keep up with them for a bit, but then I'll miss a day or two and then everything spirals out of control again.  It's like the Greek myth of the Titan who's forced to push the rock up the mountain only to have it roll back down once he reaches the top.  easy to say that it's not my fault, I have ADHD, things are just harder for me, etc. But it's still my fault that my life is like this. I'm the one who makes the messes that I eventually have to clean up again. I'm the one who's incapable of keeping up with little consistencies.  am I supposed to do about this?

I’m at a low dose and it’s very ineffective.  admit, in a bout of discouragement, I double-upped on the dose and it worked magnificently; I did this for 3 days before marking it as a mistake and   figuring I’d might as well just wait until we could get the prescription upped to that dose (we’re increasing in 10 mg intervals, I presume, so it’ll likely be a sec… lol).  mostly stressed about being drug tested.

My wife was diagnosed with ADHD about 2 years ago and it was a big relief for us to finally understand some things.  me it was good because things that would irritate me I understood were beyond her control. That doesn't mean that, at times, it can't be difficult.

And again I'm talking about necessary things, not little, or petty things.  I'm just at an impass because I know it's hard for her and I want to help her and be supportive but also, sometimes I feel helpless and need her to dial in, or do her best to. o of anyone has any resources or anything like that I'd appreciate being alerted to them.  just as a heads up I'll be disconnected from the internet for a few hours so if I don't respond, or respond late please know I really appreciate any feedback and will get back as soon as I can.)  obligatory, I'm on mobile, excuse grammar etc.Living with ADHD but not having it",1635365005,1425,267

ADHD,"Hello everybody, am looking for help with my friend who became my roommate a couple of months ago. Let's call her Judy. I have known Judy for some years. We are both in our late twenties. Judy has always struggled in her private life, as well as in her job. he was diagnosed with ADHD at the age of 22. moved in with me after basically getting evicted at her last place. he was living with another friend who struggled with addiction, and I don't know the full story, but they both got evicted. I live in a shared house with another friend and we decided to let Judy come live with us. But there are some struggles and I hope to find advice on how to deal with it as a friend and roommate. I **don't want to evict Judy beause she has moved a lot in the last 2-3 years, and by now she would have no chance to get an apartment, which means she would end up homeless...** Chores: here, we already found kind of a solution. he doesn't have to do chores she dislikes, so no compost and no toilet cleaning for her. We, the two others, have days when we do our chores, she instead has timespans where things have to be done, e.g. one week to clean out the cupboards.* Rent: At the beginning, she forgot to pay the rent several times. This has improved, she now pays on time. But I still have to remind her on the last day of the month because otherwise she forgets.* Forgetting things: This is a larger problem. he took my mail into her room and forgot that she took it, therefore I received an important letter from my employer too late. he puts her dishes into the kitchen and forgets about them. he cooks food, forgets it in the kitchen and leaves it on the stove until it becomes rotten. he used my large backpack for shopping and forgot it at the mall.* Procrastinating: We can't take off every unpleasnt chore of her. If she has to do something that she doesn't like, she sometimes procrastinates for weeks. he had accumulated lots of cardboard, so we agreed that it's her turn to bring out the cardboard. This tooks her weeks, sometimes she would open the closet with the cardboard, stare at it for minutes, then closing it again. The same with putting away her food scraps. They sometimes lay around for days until she puts them away. The same with my water bottle: she took my water bottle out and broke it and we agreed that she would replace it. This has taken her over two months to go to the store 5mins away to get a new bottle for me. he once even put her shoes and jacket on and went downstairs, only to stand aoriund for about ten minutes, then come backup and say that she will to it another time.* Lying: This is the toughest one. he lied several times. Not because she is a mean person, I'm 100% she doesn't intend to do harm. But it's clear that she gets overwhelmed with stuff and then backs off instead of taking accountability. For example she accidentally melted one of my fancy lunch boxes and tteid to hide it. It of course came out that it was her. It took her several weeks to replace it, and I got really frustrated about it because it is something I use very frequently. he then lied by claiming that exactly at the shop where she should buy the box, they don't accept her card. Which is not true because she has the same card company as I do and my card is accepted there. really want to give her a chance to develop and be in a stable environment at least for some time, but it sometimes is really stressful. Judy is in therapy but unfortunately she can only get a session every other week, whoch isn't enough imho.   Our other roommate isn't home as much, but she had also gotten annoyed by thing not being done. Also, she thinks it's not fair that when she broke the hairdryer, she immedately went to buy a new one two days later, while Judy can take weeks to replace things. And in general, that she takes good care if she uses my stuff and doesn't loose it, while Judy looses or breaks things all the time... I also don't want to make a asymmetrical arrangement where only the other roommate can use my stuff\* but not Judy, that seems contraproductive to me...   But I also don't want to constantly be a mom to Judy who reminds her of everything and is constantly angry because things are broken or missing...   think it's important to say that judy isn't depressed, she rather is hyper energetic most of the time. he also doesn't have blockages to do fun things. I know that struggling with unpleasnt things but having an easy time doing ejoyable things can be a trait of ADHD and I'm sure she's not doing it on purpose. of the stuff in the house belongs to me, eg kitchen supllies, living room invetory etc.Looking for help with roommate/friend",1635364099,4677,878
ADHD,"Long story short, I just moved to CO from WI and my PCP back in WI has refused to give me any more refills. I tried to let him know I was establishing with a new PCP here in CO but it has been (I cannot emphasize this enough) a hassle. I initially had an appointment at the beginning of this month - it ended up being an eye doctor (I asked the clinic to clarify if it was a primary care physician MULTIPLE times, they said yes). Obviously, I had to reschedule with another doctor and the closest appointment I could get was the first week of December. I let my doctor know about this problem and it did not change his mind at all. asked for any suggestions/advice from my past clinic and all they said was I could go to urgent care and present my case. Otherwise, I would have to fly back to WI for an appointment to, ""reestablish care"" for a prescription. I am hoping that there may be some better suggestions on here? To preface all of this, I  have been taking my meds for years (finally got to a lower dose that manages my symptoms with minimal side effects) and I am in a rather rigorous PA school program - I feel extremely discouraged and know being off of my meds will adversely affect my schooling and clinicals.PCP back in home state refuses to refill any more perscriptions",1635364093,1285,245

Of all of the difficulties i’ve had to live with day to day, the most problematic for me was my anger management, or lack there of. Growing up i was a happy person, but anger was a very strong emotion for me. Best described as a kettle boiling over. I don’t remember ever going from 0-100 in a flash, my level of anger would climb as the situation continued. Definitely quicker sometimes than others, but there was always a climb. As i grew up and matured, i was aware this was not okay and that i needed to work on it. Over time, i learned to catch myself before i let the “kettle” boil over. I got better at letting things go.

ADHD,"My university has an adhd/ld center where they have two coaches who specialize in adhd you can meet with to kind of help you with school. I met with one of them for the first time the other day and just kind of talked about some of the things ive been struggling with or want to improve on. We came up with a study plan for myself that works with my schedule bc consistency is something i struggle with. thing i brought up was that I want to do an internship or research over the summer but have a hard time applying for them because,1. it doesn’t seem urgent enough since summer feels so far away and i have a hard time motivating myself, and 2. i struggle a lot with rejection and i discourage myself from applying for things i may want because i feel like other people are probably more qualified or have better social/interview skills so i should just save myself the criticism. I know this is a poor mentality to have and im working to make it better, but the whole time she kept asking me if i thought point #2 was actually adhd related and if those were just things about myself that are separate. he asked me thing like 4 or 5 time in the 45 mins we met for and never really addressed it at all just moved on to something else.  guess my question would be was I wrong to bring that up or to contribute those things about myself to my adhd. The only purpose of having those two coaches is because they specialize in adhd so im sure their very knowledgeable on the subject matter and have met with a lot of people. I don’t know, I just thought that my emotional sensitivity to a lot of things was a byproduct of my adhd. I’ve only been diagnosed for a few months and certainly don’t know as much as i still would like too.

But as I got older it started to really affect me to the point where it makes it hard to function in school/work. I have been going to general therapy and it hasn’t been very helpful so I decided to speak to my primary care doctor.  My primary care doctor referred me to a neurologist and today I went. He honestly made me feel like I was making everything up. first thing he did was make memorize 5 words that he asked me to repeat later on and then he asked me draw two shapes. He didn’t really ask me about my concerns and when I did tell him he just said “oh it’s normals for students to not want to do their work”. After he just checked some of my reflexes and then left the room. he returned he said that he doesn’t believe there is much wrong with me, and he doesn’t like to prescribe meds to people in their 20s. He also went on to say he doesn’t like to prescribe meds to adults b/c there are adverse affects later on like heart problems and that it can affect fertility in women (??????) Im not sure how true any of this is .

Last night, for instance, I assumed she'd already eaten as it was 8 pm and picked myself up a sandwich after work. I also forgot to get the milk she asked me to get. When I got home and realized she hadn't eaten and that I'd forgotten to get the milk, I immediately felt like a total jerk and begged her to let me get her something to eat and pick up the milk. he just kept saying it's fine and insinuating that I was inconsiderate and that she'd never do forget to get me food like I did to her. continued to beg her to let me get her food, but she refused and remained angry. It was at this point that I tried to explain to her that I genuinely just spaced out and it has nothing to do with me not caring, I just want to get her something to eat. every time we have such fights, I try explaining that me forgetting is not personal or an indication that I don't care about her, it's just a symptom of my ADHD. Despite this, she insists that I'm inconsiderate and goes out of her way to make me feel bad about it.  get me wrong, I completely understand the frustration on her end. he tries to tell me that I'm invalidating her feelings, but I always tell her that she's 100% allowed to feel frustrated, annoyed, angry, or whatever feelings come up. I also say that what she *isn't* allowed to do, is take those feelings out on me directly and intentionally make me feel like an asshole because of it. All I ask is for her to express her frustration in a more productive way as to not make me feel like a total jerk over something I essentially have no control over. explained my ADHD issues to her way too many times to count, and while she seems to understand it logically, she doesn't take it to heart and completely contradicts it all when she's upset at me. I can promise you that I don't use it as an excuse. I even told her that there *have* been times where I was an inconsiderate jerk and didn't blame it on my ADHD, because I genuinely didn't feel like that was the reason for what I had done at the time.  understand that while I cannot change the way my brain works, she doesn't *have* to make it her problem as well and she's entitled to decide that she doesn't want to deal with it anymore.

ADHD,"I started Ritalin (10 mg 2x/day) a month ago and I definitely feel a difference, but maybe not enough? The first thing I noticed was how quiet my inner thoughts were. As in, whatever I was thinking was the only thing I could hear. It was pretty spectacular. I have also noticed a big difference in my sensory issues that unfortunately come back when the meds wear off. Emotional regulation has been much easier and I’m getting the best sleep of my life.  thing I have noticed is that I am having almost a harder time in conversations with forgetting words. It’s nothing new but I do think it might be worse. I have a theory that I just need to adjust to having quieter/less thoughts. Maybe all that background noise helped me find words? I figured I’d ask here if anyone else has had a similar experience and if you found a solution!Forgetting words on Ritalin??",1635356132,862,157

ADHD,"I’ll try to keep this pretty short and sweet. in a relationship with just an absolutely lovely human, he is amazing.  He brought it to my attention early in the relationship (it still is quite a new relationship) that he was a bit concerned about my memory, and I had noticed it too. I couldn’t remember conversations we were having in the middle of having them, I zoned out a lot and anytime I was going to see him I felt like I was going to (or would) throw up from being so excited. I didn’t want to continue being that way not only for his sake but obviously my own.  began taking prescribed Adderall for my ADHD a couple weeks ago and I immediately noticed amazing results. I no longer have anxiety, and if I do it takes a lot. I don’t get overwhelmed anymore really, I can plan things in my day out. It’s awesome. I still have sensitivity to noise and crowds of people though, but I’m working on that.  he mentioned the other day that he spoke with his friend (who is a therapist) about how he was worried I was no longer excited about him, and it broke my heart. I acknowledge I no longer feel INTENE emotions, I feel what I imagine is a normal amount of happy and sad and excited and anxious.  think because I experience emotions on a average level now that maybe my mannerisms or level of affection aren’t as frequent? I don’t mean for it to be that way, I’m just always so caught up in the moment, and I feel like I spend so much time concentrating on soaking up my new found clarity and experiences.  says it’s like he’s getting to know both sides of me, and that nothing has changed, we’re still happy and I’m love. I think It just took him getting used to the “new” me I assume.  you began taking Adderall, how was your partner?

ADHD,"I've been in therapy four times now for depression, anxiety, and BED. I also have chronic daily headaches (maybe migraines, I have some migraine symptoms but not a lot and I've been medicated for the past 5ish years so my neurologist thinks my headaches might just be subdued migraines). For the past 2.5(?) years I was on topiramate for my headaches, and it was terrible. Numbness and tingling that would wake me up at night, brain fog, recall and retention problems. It made college so miserable, I was incredibly depressed and anxious and wanted to drop out. At the time I was so out of it I would walk home or to school or whatever and be so completely zoned out that when I looked up and realized where I was and couldn't remember how I got there I would cry. I didn't know what day of the week it was and went to the wrong place at the wrong day/time, and didn't believe people when they told me it was a different day of the week.  told my most recent therapist (I did not have a lot of luck with the last two) and my psychiatrist all of this and they both thought all of these symptoms were from the topiramate and they would go away once I stopped taking it. I stopped in June, and these problems are still driving me crazy. The worst is that I have no sense of time. Every day feels completely separate from the rest of my life. If you asked me what I did yesterday morning, it takes as much effort to remember as if you had asked me what I did on a random day in July. Tomorrow feels completely disconnected from today, and I don't know if I'm not interested in planning ahead or if it just doesn't occur to me or if it's not even something I could conceptualize, but without constantly checking my weekly schedules (which do not change, I do the same exact thing every week) I think I would be completely lost. Even making those schedules was a bitch, it took like two weeks of intending to write it all out before I was finally able to make myself do it.  misplace things constantly, if I set something down I immediately lose it. I cry multiple times a week over how stupid it is. I picked up a prescription and the next day had no idea where I set it and spent a good 20 minutes crying and looking for it before I found it on the shelf next to the rest of my medicine, where I swear I had looked like 4 times already. I feel like information goes into my brain and immediately leaves. There are sticky notes all over my desk, I have so many reminders set on my phone, I flag every email because if I don't reply right away I forget. I keep wanting to make a list of these things when they upset me, but of course I forget that too lol. don't know what's going on. The forgetfulness sounds like an ADHD symptom, and when I go through that ADHD self-report scale (I don't even know how valid that thing is) I would say often or very often for all except the hyperactivity questions. There were things in my childhood that would suggest something like ADHD as well: I generally did well in school and thought it was pretty easy but when my parents tried to help me with something I didn't understand (read: math in all forms) man they would screeeam at me because I didn't hear a word they said. I would read for like 6 hours at a time without getting up and procrastinated absolutely everything. I think there would have been more red flags if I hadn't had such a structured schedule and very strict parents, but since every week was always the same and the expectations were laid out so clearly I was able to do okay in my own way.  I was 18 I started amitriptyline for the headaches, and the two years I was on it were noticeably better than the time before and after (except for the exhaustion, that was terrible). I tried amitriptyline again this summer, for depression and anxiety this time, and even though it was some crazy transformation I felt like I could do things, like things were easy. If I walked into the kitchen and saw the dishes in the sink I just thought ""I should do the dishes"" and then I did it. I cleaned my shit show apartment, I planned for my week, I felt like if I wanted to do something I knew I could just do it. Everything that I feel like I neglect (cleaning, self-care, errands, little fulfilling things like reading or going for a walk) I know that I really want to do, I'm not procrastinating it because I want to do it I just can't. I don't know why I can't, I feel like I can never get started and then once I do start if I lose momentum I stop completely. Like if I'm doing dishes and I need to get dirty dishes from the living room I can't come back and keep washing dishes, I've lost the momentum and I just put them in the sink and find something else to do.  brought this up to my psychiatrist and my therapist and they are both focused on my anxiety. When I try to explain this, they see it as ""you're anxious so you don't do \_\_x\_\_"" but it's more like ""I'm anxious BECAUE I don't do \_\_x\_\_."" Like I want to be social and be healthy and have a clean home but I can't and because I can't I am anxious, I know I'm supposed to and it upsets me that I can't and that makes me anxious.  don't really know what to do, it does help to treat the anxiety because at the end of the day the anxiety bothers me too, but I feel like its maybe a bit of a band-aid? Like in college I was so anxious because I felt dumb because I couldn't remember anything...and now I feel anxious because little things seem insurmountable but it's not because I'm avoiding them or overreacting to them, it's because they literally do not cross my mind until they're a problem. I don't even know what I'm asking, maybe just for some validation or something lol because this bothers me so much every day and when I try to get help for it I'm told its a symptom of a medicine I don't take anymore or that maybe we can look into it if it keeps bothering me but for now I need to focus on the anxiety.  ideas? Advice? Or if you don't think it sounds like ADHD then maybe some other explanation? It already felt good enough just to get that all out in one go.Maybe I have ADHD? Idk but its driving me crazy",1635354835,6131,1181

My doctor in my old city was wonderful and provided me with 3 prescriptions to carry me through the process of finding a new doctor.

ADHD,"Hi everyone. I got diagnosed with ADHD combined type at 23 years old two weeks ago. At first I was elated to get my diagnosis. I thought my life would finally start to become easier for me. I've had a hard time since I can remember with motivation, anxiety, racing thoughts, focus,  and poor emotional regulation. I realize meds cannot ""cure"" these things, but I know they can be very helpful. I thought I would finally be able to have an easier time with life instead of feeling like I'm  overexerting myself all. the. time.  was prescribed Concerta 36mg (generic) and every day since I started taking it I have been feeling worse. I had some benefit with focus, concentration, and felt calm the first day I took it that lasted for  6ish hours. Everyday since has just been weird side effects and today after taking it I just feel depressed. I find some of my ADHD symptoms to be worse at times as well. I haven't had problems with depression for YEAR and I feel just as bad as I did then. It's only been 5 days on the med and it just keeps getting progressively more difficult to deal with the effects. I've only been taking them each day in the hopes there  will be some sort of positive change, but I think after today and how I'm feeling I just need to stop. told my psychiatrist how I was feeling and she immediately wants me to try a new variation of buproprion that can help with ADHD instead of trying a different stimulant or dose. I've been on buproprion (although it was Wellbutrin instead of this version) before for depression and did not enjoy it at all, and I know stimulants are supposedly way more effective at treating ADHD. he's worried other stimulants will make my anxiety worse, but the one thing I haven't experienced so far is  worsening in anxiety; in fact on the day that the med did work my anxiety felt better. feel really defeated right now and like I'm doing something wrong. Is it possible to not respond at all (positively) to a stimulant med and know on the first try? Am I right to believe I should try a different  stimulant/dosage or do I need to listen to my psychiatrist about trying a nonstimulant? Is it possible that \*no med\* will help me? would love to hear about other people's experiences on how they found the right treatment when they were first diagnosed and the process they went through. I was prescribed Concerta 36mg as my first stimulant treatment and it's hindering my life instead of enhancing it. I feel no benefits on it and feel like there's something wrong with me.

ADHD,"Hey, just want to introduce myself.  a 24-year-old male who was diagnosed with ADHD at an early age and have taken daily ADHD medications the most of my life. I used to be embarrassed at how different I am on vs off the medication but I've accepted who I am. don't really have a point to make, just wanted to say hi. I appreciate your posts because I never have someone who can relate to the ADHD lifestyle.

I've never wished I was different or didn't have my ADHD because I love who I am. Anyway, I'm probably rambling right now but here are some differences I've noticed on vs off my medication:  APPETITE (On) I don't have a strong appetite throughout the day and oftentimes need to remind myself to eat. (Off) I can literally eat throughout the day with no breaks * OCIAL (On) I'm reserved and keep to myself. (Off) Oh boy, I'll say anything to anyone anywhere with no regard or thought. Very outgoing and social. * TAK (On) I can get through the day completing tasks on time with no problem. (Off) I'll experience a million unrelated thoughts and behaviors within 2 minutes of starting a chore * FACIAL (IDK if anyone here can relate) When I'm off my meds, I'm ""smiley"" and laugh a lot.  are some ADHD traits that you experienced?

ADHD,"Backstory: I was diagnosed with ADHD, depression and extreme anxiety at the age of 16. My support team only wanted to treat the depression stating that once my depression is cured my ADHD and anxiety will get better. We all know it does not work that way! Well I’ve never been able to focus on my life or prioritize anything. About 5 years ago they diagnosed with bipolar disorder (I know I’m not bipolar) and again only wanted to treat my depression.

ADHD,"I went to the doctor’s a few days ago to talk about my symptoms. I’ve suspected for a while that I have ADHD. As a woman in my late 20s, however, I felt apprehensive about making this appointment because I didn’t think I was going to be taken seriously. Anyways. brought a written list of my symptoms with me, so I could remember everything I wanted to say. I brought up how horrible my memory has been. Constant depression and anxiety. Making silly, sometimes dangerous mistakes. A past roommate kicking me out of her house because I kept leaving the stove burners on. Not remembering when my work shift starting and subsequently being late to work, despite checking my schedule 10 times that morning. Not being able to sit still, my horrible impulsive shopping. Constantly interrupting people when they speak, and feeling awful about it but not being able to stop. Having my boss explain things to me over and over again to me, and forgetting almost immediately. I could go on… I actually started crying at one point, and I tried to stop because I didn’t want the NP to think that I was trying to make her feel sorry for me.  was very sympathetic and kind, and she said it does sound like I could have it. he said I would have to go through behavioral health, and it would be a two part process. “That’s fine,” I said. Then she proceeded to tell me that if I were to be put on medication, that I would be subject to regular urine tests to make sure that I wasn’t taking too much, or that I wasn’t taking it at all and instead selling it “because it has street value.” Also, I will have to sign a form stating that I will not ask for my refills early.  am ok with the process, I don’t mind meeting with a behavioral health specialist. But I am definitely feeling a sense of shame already about the whole process. It makes me sad and angry that I am already being policed in regards to medication. Years ago when I saw a doctor for depression, I was prescribed Wellbutrin after a five minute discussion. There was no lecture about the danger of that drug, or mention of required drug tests. I desperately need help and I am willing to go through the process, but it is already wearing on me. I already feel ashamed about the prospect of taking Adderall or something similar.  I don’t mean to sound so doom and gloom. I’ve seen so many similar stories on here about the struggle of being taken seriously and getting an accurate diagnosis. I’m just tired. I should mention that I have Medicaid, which seems to complicate things further. Thanks for reading.Already feeling discouraged by the process",1635353163,2596,473
ADHD,"Before I was taking it I was more stressed, but when adderall kicks in it just makes me depressed after the 1st day taking it which was the only day it worked as intended, and I’m on like my 4th day. It seems to give me opposite affects of what’s supposed to happen when I take it. I get more scatter brained. somehow the “crash” is what feels the best from it because it’s like going from hell back to earth and you realize your adhd isn’t that bad. The one good thing though from taking it is I learned how to differentiate “my thoughts” from the subconscious negative talk. It seems like it’s working by putting me in a bad situation, so I can see how better it was before being on the medication and that it could be much worse.Adderall really showed me the difference between depressed and stressed",1635353063,803,151
ADHD,"I just recently spoke with my psych about being tested for ADHD, and while he was responsive and said he would provide a referral, he believes me to be more OCD and that he didn't see me as having ADHD. Anyways I've got the appointment set to be screened next month, but now I'm afraid that I'm faking it. been reading into ADHD and I've been taking notes on how my mind behaves, and possible symptoms I might have. ome of the biggest symptoms I think I might have are: Inability to wake up on time or go to bed early. I have to set EVERAL alarms just to wake up for work, I'm talking one every two minutes for an entire hour before work. I've tried everything from Alarmy, to having my lights automatically turn on at a specific time, to even having people call me. No matter what I'm always late to work by 5-10 minutes because I can't get out of bed until the very last minute.* Trouble focusing on conversations. I often zone in and out of conversations, or day dream while someone is talking to me. This also applies to things like meetings, watching class lectures, etc. Whenever I come back to the conversation mentally I always feel lost and anxious because I often miss important information. * I can never ""find"" things very well. Whenever I'm supposed to find something, be it an email, something in a filing cabinet, a file on my desktop, or something else I'm never able to find things. I just kind of gloss over whatever it is I'm looking at and never actually focus my eyes enough to look. For example if I'm looking for something in a list of items, I just look at the list randomly until what I'm looking for shows up. I'm never able to just read through each item in the list to find what I'm looking for.* I'm always shaking my legs, or doing some kind of fidgeting. In conversations, alone at my desk, alone at home, I'm always fidgeting somehow. If I don't it feels like energy accumulates in my legs and it isn't being released. It's very obvious and multiple people, including my boss, have commented on it.* I have a very ""Do it now"" or ""Do it later"" attitude with my work ethic being very sporadic in bursts where I get things done enough to keep comfortably procrastinating. I hate that I do this, I try all the time to put more effort into my work but I can never stick with it.* I often forget what I'm doing or thinking. For example, I'll go to Google something and then immediately forget what I'm trying to find. When this happens I end up typing gibberish or swear words into my search bar until I'm able to remember what it is I'm supposed to be searching for.* ometimes I am actually able to focus on something, but when I do I become incredibly invested in it and refuse to take my attention off of it until whatever it is I'm doing is complete. When this does happen I often skip lunch to continue working. * General poor time management skills, I'm always late wherever I go. I even set times in my head to leave my apartment but I'm never able to stick to them.* I'm unable to finish my personal hobby projects. I like to create stuff in my free time but I'm never able to finish a project. I often have so much that I want to do in my free time that I always stress about not being able to do anything, and then in the end I end up doing nothing but browsing my phone or something.* I struggle with reading. Long paragraphs turn me off and I can go from being interested in what I'm reading to being bored instantly. I struggle with my eyes jumping around paragraphs or skipping sentences, and when I actually try to focus on reading I don't absorb any information because I'm putting all my mental energy into actually focusing.  could keep going, but those are just some of the bigger issues I struggle with. I never really considered myself to have ADHD until recently when I started seeking mental health treatment. But I've been looking back and I realized I've struggled with these things my entire life. I've been somewhat successful in life so far, I'm 24 and have a decent job where I seem to be ok, so I'm afraid that I might just be faking these symptoms or that I'm just lazy. I want so badly to get help and to find treatment for my mind always buzzing, I just don't want to appear to my psychiatrist that I'm faking anything. Could anyone else share their thoughts, or if they had similar issues that led them to being diagnosed with ADHD? I think I have ADHD, been doing okay in life though so I feel like maybe I'm just faking it.

ADHD,"Ever since I started to do more research into the signs of ADHD, it's been strange to see how many shared behaviors I see in my father who's in his late 50's.  from a generation where one does not admit to having problems like these and one does not seek treatment. He's complained all my life, any time I've talked about struggling to pay attention, keep habits, be on time, etc. about how he's also had a really hard time, but you know, he's just always made it work and doesn't think therapy or meds are a good idea.  been funny then, more recently, recognizing little idiosyncrasies that resemble things I do, just projected out 30 years. He's always showing me these crafting projects with huge, grandiose goals, that he puts half an afternoon of work into and abandons. He interrupts and can't follow other people's stories, which I've always read as being inconsiderate, and now I'm seeing it also as a result of 50+ years of unchecked ADHD. Like me, he has a trouble staying engaged in tasks, committing to reading books, and organizing his home space.  just been interesting seeing all of these behaviors through a different lens. I think I have a tendency to excuse them or understand them when they come from younger people, but they just come off so much differently from an older person.  anyone else have similar experiences?

ADHD,"Hey there! Before all haters might hate me instantly because I am posting in this group but am not diagnosed yet: I dug deep into the topic, watched videos of Dr.s/Prof.s (not any random people who think they have clues) and diagnosed people, made a couple of self-tests which I know are not as equally worth as a diagnosis you get from a specialist but I at least talked to my doctor and started the process to get tested (and it is very likely that I have the combined version). now that I started I am stuck already. It took me 3 months to call my doctor (and I have it the easiest way because he is one of my husband's best friends and I can call him even on the weekends). It's on me to finish the pre-process like blood test and brain scan to exclude other causes for my lack of executive functioning, motivation, chaotic behavior etc. and get the real tests started after this. did you manage it? I am an adult and have to manage appointments on my own but because there is ""only"" the benefit of a diagnosis but my fear of medicamentation and the unknown on the other side I can not get myself up and make some damn appointments. Not even the pressure to be seen in a different light by my doctor and friend is enough to keep me going. cannot be too difficult :/ let me know how you handled it. Did your s.o. or a family member help you? Do you have some tricks? What was your motivation? And was your process as hard as it is for me?

Everything I tried has failed miserably, perhaps some of you also have a dozen planners with just a few entries that was discarded or substituted by sticky notes on the wall.  I honestly don't know how I got this far in life (and that's not much, 26yo and failing college). have difficulties planning my day, when I try to establish a structured routine and stick to it I find setting hours to do nearly everything is very draining, and when just a little thing doesn't go as planned and I miss something, it's like my entire week is ruined. If something shows up and it's not on my planner, everything falls apart.   example, yesterday I had to go out and get tomato sauce. But getting dressed and going to the store wasn't planned. Immediately things got out of control, I couldn't properly recalculate on the go and my day ended up being the usual mess.   trying the bullet journal now but I feel like I spent hours numbering blank pages for nothing, I don't know how it's supposed to help.

ADHD,"Hi everyone, sorry if this ends up being a very long post. I'm not sure how I can make a TLDR for this, sorry. Thank you ahead of time for anyone who does read it! I (22F) was diagnosed a couple of weeks ago with ADHD-PI, and it was... a lot? I finally had an explanation for things that have happened in my life and it was almost relieving to be able to answer these questions I had about myself. light backstory, nobody suspected I had ADHD until back in August when I started seeing a counselor at my university. I had great grades and was very well-behaved all the way through my first year of college. The story that my counselor and I have pieced together was that, for the past several years, the severe depression I was suffering from was masking the ADHD (on top of how I naturally was coping with it for so long without knowing) and once my depression was being treated and becoming more manageable, the ADHD became very apparent. I wanted to ask some questions regarding college and work. With college, the inattentiveness has been extremely bad, especially this semester. I had a class (that I ended up dropping) where I could not pay attention whatsoever during lectures. For one of the classes that I'm still in, I find myself getting consistently distracted and losing focus almost halfway into the class. Last class I was making little tally marks whenever I caught myself getting distracted, and very quickly had at least 4 marks on ONE problem. I could not keep my focus whatsoever and mentally checked out only 20 minutes into class. Does anyone have any general tips to help with this that may have worked for you? for work, I've never really had a job (my parents and I thought it was better for me to focus on school). Back in December of last year, I had just gotten my first job. I was nervous but excited because I was happy to be able to finally ""contribute"" if that makes sense. After the first day of the job though, I had a breakdown that night. I never figured out why, but it was not fun. I went in the next morning and, after an hour, I started to break down and had to make up an excuse to leave early. I never went back. I really beat myself up over it because I thought the job was very easy and that I could definitely do it! My depression was already very bad at the time, and this made it much worse and it stayed that way until I started on medication in March. forward to July this year, and I thought I was doing much better and that I could try to get a job again before the fall semester started (I was coming back from a year break of college due to various reasons). I got a job at a grocery store and made it through my first shift - and then the AME EXACT thing happened. I don't know what to do. My fiance and I decided that I should focus on one thing at a time right now while I get myself sorted out, so I'm focusing on school right now, but I really need to figure out how to tackle this issue because I want to get an internship for either the spring semester or over the summer. thank you so much if you've made it to the end of this. It probably turned into a bit of a rant but I am just kinda overwhelmed with learning about myself and my newfound condition, and figuring out how to treat this.College and Work",1635351251,3266,625
ADHD,"The argument was about seeing his parent’s dog had pooped on the rug at 5am, barely cleaning it, and saying I had cleaned it “a bit.” It lasted all day, throughout work, after work, and in the morning I was still upset. He called me lazy and said even if I was really tired, I should’ve cleaned it. He brought up that I want kids and a dog in the next few years, so I should get used to doing things when I’m tired. After a long conflict and discussions about how to better communicate with me, I felt anxious the next day relaxing before work. My thoughts were, will I have this time when I have kids and a dog? I should get used to the lifestyle by working harder and reducing my free time. My expenses are low right now, but they won’t be as low when I have kids/a dog, so I should pretend I’m already paying for that and put my money aside. I feel like it’s punishing myself but not really? It feels somewhat reasonable adjusting my lifestyle now and proving to myself that I can do it.

ADHD,"Lately, Ive (31M) been really struggling trying to study for a personal project. And part of my therapy is learning how to re-parent myself. o I met with a local school counselor at a bar to talk about ADHD, and how she addresses it in children today. I went into it hoping to find a better way to talk to myself than ""just sit and do it."" first thing she addressed was that all kids know better, know what they ""should"" be doing, but they often can't for various reasons. he trains teachers and administration to work *with* the child. And she herself works with a lot of ADHD kids (out of a school of 800, she said roughly 100 diagnosed, and in her opinion probably another 100-200 undiagnosed). That was cool to hear because I definitely did not experience that in my school days. also learned that my local schools actually have exercises for children to develop mindfulness. They work with children to identify what ""emotional zone"" they're in when they ""act out."" And they provide children with healthy coping strategies and the time and space to execute them. For example, they allow children to take a walk outside for a moment if they need to. Or children can step outside of the room and catch their breathe. Right in the middle of class! also explained how to motivate kids with ADHD is different, and also differs between different ADHD kids. But she explained using extrinsic and intrinsic motivation. he works with the child's *values* to find intrinsic motivation, and to use addition to motivate instead of subtraction. I thought that was really enlightening. I was always trained to motivate myself by taking things away from me. And in college that manifested in no video games / hanging out / eating out / good things until whatever it was was done. But I realize that that just generates anxiety around good things so I binge them when I have them because Im so scared it'll be taken from me. noted a lot of her job's difficulty is teachers are put in a difficult situation when, in my area, they're outnumbered 20-30 to 1 so individualized care is impossible. And also parents, teachers, and administrators often don't understand, which can manifest in denial of what the kid is going through. broke down in tears listening, which was awesome because I am generally hard pressed for emotions in public! I wish I was afforded that luxury as a kid. I personally experienced my principal telling my mom ""why dont you discipline your kid like the other Asian parents."" Which I guess was a thing that was okay back then. main thing she stressed was working *with* the ADHD; emotionally accepting it. It made me reflect on how I have grown up really in denial of it. It was always this part of me ""to overcome; to get through."" it was cool to see how much perspective has shifted, at least in my area. And it felt good for my inner child to see for his own eyes that it was the system he grew up in that was wrong, and nothing was wrong with him. if you made it this far, thanks for joining me. I can relate to how difficult it mightve been to sit through this wall of text. Im proud of you for getting here even if it took a few days or multiple re-reads or you just jumped here looking for the tldr. You read how you read. Im glad youre here. I am still self-diagnosed because Im scared. I was diagnosed as a child. I have trauma with people just telling me to ""not let it take over; just discipline yourself; just get through it."" I also have trauma regarding big pharma. I know I have nothing to be ashamed of, and I am working through that internalized shame. note: the counselor is 26 years old so that also may be why she's with the times.

I’ll just stop where I am and squat down to put the insides of my knees against my ears because my hands don’t muffle the noise enough. I also really dislike earbuds because if they’re in for more than about a half hour, they really “hurt” my ears. And by hurt, I mean I focus on the feeling of them so hard that I freak myself out.  great. I’m fine*** the ear headphones allow me to muffle the sounds so my brain can breathe but also not focus on any particular feeling that I dislike. 80% of the time when I’m wearing headphones, they are silent. It also looks pretty normal to everyone else AND… the added benefit of people not talking to you lol.Tip: if you have auditory/tactile sensory processing problems, get big over the ear headphones to wear when you’re feeling overwhelmed. They greatly muffle all the sounds but also don’t put pressure on your ears. You don’t even need to have them on.",1635348863,960,176

ADHD,"Hi friends, looking for some advice, and I'm new to this sub. Found it when I Googled my question, but I didn't find the answer I was looking for so I'm posting my question. do y'all do for a job, do you love it or hate it, and why? one of those people who's starting to figure out that I probably have ADHD a good bit into adulthood, and while I'm trying to make lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, etc.) to help with my overall moodyness, I just can't get past how much I hate my job. no need to get into all the details here, but basically it's a boring office job. It's the kind of job where my efforts are never enough, and I'm constantly being pressured to revolve more and more of my life around something I will never care about more than I need to in order to collect a paycheck. problem is that it's got good pay and benefits, and the job function itself is pretty easy, so I've stuck it out long enough that this is now kind of my career. It's something I could probably do indefinitely, but it leaves me feeling so empty that I have no energy left to do anything I like outside of work, and I'm feeling that my overall quality of life is poor because I don't have any hobbies, I have no connection to my local community, I'm always reluctant to socialize, etc. like to make a career transition, but I know that's the sort of thing I'll only get to do once, so I want to make it count. It has to make a decent amount of money, it has to be fun, and it has to be something that someone with zero experience can transition into. I know that's a tall order, but it is what it is.

ADHD,"Ok so I have ADD and I think RD as well. I have a best friend and outside of a childhood friend shes kind of my only friend. We are like two peas in a pod and shes very dear to me. We tried dating briefly in the past but it didn’t work out and we agreed we are better as friends. when it comes to her hanging out or even talking to other people sometimes I get very hurt by it. I know its not healthy but I feel like i cant control it. Like she just started a new job and tells me about all of these guys that have been hitting on her. he’s not interested and finds it humorous.I don’t go out of the house much and sometimes when she tells me about her funny work encounters I feel bad about myself and worry about her liking someone more than me.  felt this way before we tried to be romantic last year and I dont think its like a romantic jealousy thing. Like this morning she texted me and told me she was out to eat with her old bestie that she had a falling out with. I got really sad and actually cried about it. These feelings only lasts for like 20-30 mins and then im able to compose myself and have a normal reaction to everything. But man in that moment i get so emotional sad and just start feeling like im too boring for her or something even though shes never done anything to make me  feel that way. you have any advice on controlling these feelings ?  know that its not rational and bc of that I never let her see these reactions. he has no idea and i play it off when we’re together. I never want to be a toxic person to her and make her feel guilty for having a life outside of me. I actually want us both to have healthy friend circles while remaining each others favorite person.

ADHD,"Hello. I'm a current college student living in Toronto in my final year of school and I have an opportunity to transfer to a university in cotland for an accelerated Master's degree. Unfortunately, the state of mental health care where I live is absolutely abysmal. I was diagnosed with ADHD a couple years ago, but the psychiatrist I saw for my diagnosis does not offer on-going care for ADHD patients. My doctor at the time wrote me a prescription for Dexedrine and it worked very well for me, but then later she decided to end my prescription. he says it was because of my weight, but I had gained weight since starting it, so I don't know if I believe that. Anyway, I later started seeing a new doctor (for unrelated reasons) who thought it would be a good idea to find a psychiatrist to provide oversight during treatment to ensure everything goes fine, but after 16 months of searching for a psychiatrist we finally ran out of options. One psychiatrist had accepted the referral she sent, but then later rejected it. Another had agreed to set up an appointment with me, but then she just asked about my family a lot and if I got in trouble at school often before deciding that was enough to say my previous ADHD diagnosis wasn't valid and refusing to discuss it any further. Finally, I asked my doctor about non-stimulant medications since that wasn't getting anywhere and she reluctantly agreed to prescribe one, but it has been an awful experience for me the past six weeks I have been taking it. It feels like it helps a tiny bit, but that the side effects do so much harm as to make my overall condition worse. have heard that healthcare in general is better in the UK, especially for stuff that's not covered here in Canada like mental health. I am sort of interested in going to get my Master's degree even though I'm not sure it would help me during my career other than as something to put on a resume. My biggest consideration, however, is that I don't believe I would be able to perform well in my current condition in a career. If I were to end my education I might not be able to secure the kind of future I am hoping for. I don't think I would be able to hold a job. That's why I'm wondering what things are like in cotland. I know how well I was able to perform in school and to take care of other important things while I was taking a stimulant in the past, so I believe that I would be able to keep up with the required workload if I were to continue my education with the support that I need. That's why I'm wondering what the state of mental healthcare in cotland is like. I would like to know things like how long expected wait times might be, if there are any costs associated with accessing care, if it is likely I will need to be rediagnosed by my care provider, whether I need a referral from a physician to access psychiatric care, and anything else which might be relevant or useful to know before making a decision. I would really appreciate any information that people can provide.How accessible is psychiatric care in Scotland?",1635347723,3061,565

ADHD,"&amp;#x200B; this summer I had lets call them episodes of what I'd call anxiety attacks..  There were two instances where I was in a rather medium size group of people (20-ish) and it was in a broad wide open area in a huge yard.  And i actually for once ( this is huge ) I liked those people and they actually fucking liked me back.  At some point they were all talking among themselves and there was like 4-5 topics that they were talking about. As much as I tried to concentrate on just one topic, I couldn't.  And then after like 5min of doing my best to engage in a conversation I started feeling overwhelmed, cold sweat was all over my body, and then I could just hear everyone murmuring at the same time. My head hurt. And I couldn't stop it. Things got worse and I started feeling dizzy, heavy and short breathed at the same time. I wanted to leave but couldn't get up. I did my best to comfort myself and not cause a scene and make a fool out of myself. Again.   This went on for a full hour until I finally managed to calm myself down.   thing happened two weeks later also in an open area when we were at a restoran with a different group of people.  Thanks to my prior experience I realized what was to happening and excused myself from the table barely being able to walk. I said I had too much to drink even tho I didn't drink even one whole beer and went for a walk on the beach.  The moment I realized I was out of their sight I sat down and did my best to properly breathe. It took me almost 20minutes of being away from everyone and everything to calm myself down enough to go back to our table.   reason I'm writing here is because I know of my ADHD but I never experienced anything like this, and few days ago a dear friend of mine got diagnosed with APD , while talking about it and its symptoms i realized they are quite similar to those of ADHD and what made my friend seek help was the exact same thing that happened to me.   In our chats we both agreed that the trigger for this attack was that there was too much of loud audio info that we just couldn't handle and fell apart .   I'm wondering if there are other people who had these kind of episodes or at least anyone who could shed some more light on these situations. In a few days i'll be going on a teambuilding trip and I am sure that I will find myself in a similar situation. I only wish to avoid making a scene thus asking anyone for help. found the symptoms of APD for you guys to inspect.    Difficulty following multi-step or complex directions.* Difficulty multi-tasking in auditory situations, e.g., listening and taking notes.* pelling, reading, writing issues.* Lack of music appreciation.* Problems with the ability to localize the source of a signal.* Difficulty following conversation on the telephone.* Difficulty following directions.* Difficulty with rapid or accented speech.* Difficulty following long conversations.* Difficulty learning a foreign language or technical information where language is novel or unfamiliar.* ocial issues—difficulty “reading” others/pragmatic communication issues.* Organizational problems.   of these except the lack of music appreciation fit my personal description, and I am not here seeking diagnosis, but rather some tips and tricks on how to deal with a lot of audio info so I don't fall apart like before.ADHD and APD, please read this, I know its long but I need any kind of feedback.",1635347331,3423,617

ADHD,"Hi - here. Just diagnosed in my early 50's. Looking forward to being a part of this community. I have a ton of questions and still wrapping my head around actually being diagnosed this late and the treatments, etc. For now though.... started on 40mg of traterra as my first med and was overwhelmed right out of the gate with the side effects. The nausea, heartburn, dizziness, sexual/prostrate issues. Was tough to function without periodic rest. I made it 10-12 days before giving up. doc then put on me on Adderall XR, originally 10mg, now 15mg. It does work really well but I'm figuring out that it's a band-aid or a plug in the drain for the 5-6 hours I get relief. I understand I could benefit from a late afternoon/evening dose but now realizing the traterra was actually working better being more steady, less of a roller coaster than Adderall. I'm wondering if anyone here had multiple severe side effects from traterra that eventually subsided after x period of time or do they tend to stick around for good? Debating about trying it again but the thought of going back to these side effects is about as exciting as looking forward to dental work.

I don't wanna say I'm uninformed about it, I think I know more than the average person on it, and I've had suspicions, but since this has been my whole experience and haven't ever experienced 'normal' to contrast it I never went too out of my way to learn what it meant, and I also didn't want for it to get in my head and self-diagnosing myself because of it. now, that a professional told me I have an attention deficit and think about it I just feel... **validated**. guess I should give the context on why she told me that. o, nearing the end of the session she asked me the last question, what was I expecting to improve going to therapy, and I said that for the near future I just hope to be able to improve my output and performance in college (which I feel I'm failing at). Then, she gave her conclusion about why I'm having issues in college which are two things: first, there's a lot of personal issues in my life right now that are affecting my abilities to study and do well in college (which I knew beforehand); and second, I have an attention deficit that's always been there, but I was able to pass through Primary and econdary school with good grades with minimal effort without having to study because (her words not mine) I'm a very smart person (she got me blushing). don't know, it's just so fucking validating, you know? I'm not just a damn lazy scumbag that used the last of his intelligence in Primary school, I actually have things within myself that affect my abilities to do well in college.  that's not at all dismissing the fact that now that I know what I have I could actually *treat it* so I actually have a bit of an easier time with it (I'm wondering if I should notify my college about it in the future, but I don't know if they deal with students with ADHD differently in anyway). couldn't find the word yesterday, but it's validated, It's so so validating.

Here in Europe, people still are quite fond of cars with manual transmissions, and I cannot for the life of me understand why. ure it might be a good skill to have in case of an absolute emergency where there's no automatic transmissions available, or if I ever *have* to drive someone else's car.  I've been on like 7-8 lessons so far and it's going fine, however, I've become very sloppy when I change gears and that's only because I'm confident I'll do it right.  alert; I'M NOT DOING IT RIGHT -.- driving with the teacher the other day I went from 1 straight to 5 instead of 2, it's a good thing the car shows me which gear I'm at, otherwise I would've been driving on 5 until it died.

I kid you not when I say that I cried for a good 30 minutes before driving with her.

I have been diagnosed as a child and started primary education 1 year later for this reason, but since then I have not received any counseling or anything else. covid started, all my university lessons have been online - that makes it about year and a half. As many of you can probably imagine and relate to, this has been fairly hard for me. When I am not in the classroom, I know nobody can see me etc. I lose focus even faster than usual. There is of course also a ton of assignments I have to keep up with and by now, it is seriously getting very difficult to manage to keep working from home for as many hours a day as I need to. My grades suffered, my morale and mental health had also. I have started consuming great amounts of caffeine every day to cope with this, but it is just not enough of stimulus and I know it cannot be a long term solution. do you guys do? How do you manage online lessons, how do you keep yourself in line when you need to? I am not on meds and I have never been in my life because honestly - I am scared of it. Also I would have to get in contact with some institutions, which would likely be expensive and tedious.

Getting out of bed, and doing so on time, has been a huge challenge for me my entire life. I’ve been penalized in so many ways for it over the years, but now as a teacher I’m really punishing myself. I absolutely love teaching, and I think I’m pretty good at it, but my lateness really sets a poor example and makes me feel like such a failure. It really, really gets to me and I don’t know what to do. question to y’all is, have you found ways to successfully manage this in your own lives? Why is sleep so problematic for those of us with ADHD?

ADHD,"o far, I've tried two or three (depending on how you're counting) and nothing has really done much of anything adhd-wise. (medikinet) 10mg felt like nothing felt like I had ALL the attention span and none of the control (to an absolute extreme) (ritalin modified release) doesn't really feel like much of anything is happening. I sometimes notice I get into hyperfocus a bit more frequently and intensely than normal but I can't really control it. 75-150-300mg did literally nothing for my adhd and I only got the side effects. (insomnia, sex stuff, etc) kinda discouraged. When my doc prescribed me the 30mg a few weeks ago, he said that after that, there's not much he can do without a psychiatrist. (not sure if he meant I should see a psychiatrist or if he's gonna ask for a psychiatrist's advice) I tried getting a psychiatrist appointment a few months ago and nobody seemed to accept new patients. now, I'm pretty sure he's gonna prescribe me Ritalin 40mg, since it seems to be the highest dose they make, but after that, I don't really know.  I finally managed to get over my fear of getting an appointment and anxiety and executive dysfunction enough to get an appointment, I was happy because it was a first step and it seemed like things would be alright soon enough. But now, I'm a bit less hopeful.  seeing posts about people talking about their first dose like it changed their life and everything was right on their first try is a bit discouraging, tbh. I just listed what I've tried already and then explained that none of it helped, then whined that it was discouraging and I didn't really know where to go next because it's impossible to find a psychiatrist who'll accept new patients and I think it could be helpful to see that other people have had a similar struggle and tried plenty of meds before finding something that helped.How many meds did you have to try before you found the right one(s)?",1635340354,1917,340

I've basically self isolated myself from society for the past 10 to 12 years of my life and I'm not finally coming to the realization that is my life and what i'm doing and I have to finally pick my shit up and go get a job and make some money. You'll be surprised to find out i'm almost 30 too. I just got my first retail job in a clothing store and yesterday was my first day. I didnt know what to expect. My contract was for Delivery Assistant. I applied to the position because i didnt want to be on the shop floor and away from customers and working with tills because I'm not a people person. I'm extremely awkward and shy and when I'm not. I put on a mask and I feel like i'm too obvious trying to be nice and smiley when i have this mask on. Anyway I walked into the store and was told to look for the manager on my first day and they'll show me around and what to do . No manager in sight. Even one of the other workers there called on the pager for the manager and she said the manager will be with you soon. Didnt see the manager once that day. I was completely thrown into the deep end on my first day with no training, no guidance, nothing. My contract is for delivery assistant. I'm suppose to be in the stockroom hanging clothes, scanning all that stuff but my first day, I was thrown onto the shop floor as a sales consultant. With zero training on how to use tills and talk to customers. Luckily all the customers were easy to talk to just looking for directions and I had no idea where everything was so i just pointed in any direction and hoped they found it. I spent the whole day asking other workers what I should be doing. They all seemed to know what to do but expect me. I spent the whole day walking around the store like a headless chicken and bored out of my mind. At one point, i felt like crying and jut walking out of the store. There was no managers around all day. No managers to tell us when we can have our lunch or take a break. There was one guy there from 11 am and he never had his lunch or a toilet break and he has been working for 8 hours. I never had a chance to grab a drink of water so I was completely dehydrated and exhausted once i left the store.  dont want t sound like a stuck up person because we all have to do things we dont like. This is how i've been treated growing up. Never to complain and always remember theres people out there worse than you and you cant feel sorry for yourself because theres worse out there so just stick it up and get on with it. We were never allowed to have feelings growing up around my parents. There saying was always just ''tick it up and get on with it'' But i dont know if i'm capable of doing this job. I need routine. I need to be able to walk into a job and know what i'm doing everyday. Put my bag down and i'm ready to go and do the job. Not have to search for a manager and ask what i'm doing. I dont know what to do. I want to leave this job so badly. I dont feel like i'm capable for it. Everything in my life is moving so fast right now.

For those who are based in UK: is ADHD therapy something I can get free on NH (like they do with depression and anxiety)?therapy for ADHD,1635336916,406,76
ADHD,"I was just recently diagnosed and am wondering what are some good resources to learn about how ADHD affects daily life and how to fix it. I have always thought that the way I acted was normal because I am the only context I have when it comes to brain function. However, after talking to my therapist and being hospitalized for a suicidal stint, I am quickly learning that I have *not* been acting normal. Does anyone have any good books or websites or anything to learn more about ADHD? feel free to share your ADHD testimony below. I would love to understand the experience of others with ADHD to see the different ways it can manifest.Looking for resources.",1635336909,660,119

ADHD,"I just took vyvanse. it makes me less tired and motivated. but, it somehow makes my brain slower? Also, i feel like it wears off in 4h.. it makes me feel chill and just better, i feel like a normal human being. Im less tired. Im more motivated.I compeltly stop fidgeting My attention stays the same. maybe more daydreaming, but that could be because im just so surprised that it works that good. It makes my social anxiety dissappear. is that what it should do? its not the first time so no "" first use = euphoria' comments please. im on 50mg guess it cant fix everything but im already happy about these things that it fixes. only side effect is the crash and dry throat for me. i dont even have motivation to talk to people and im very toxic. the biggest + is the social interaction and no tiredness.

ADHD,"I had the worst experience in schools growing up, always getting suspended/detention, getting kicked out of the classroom almost every day and being made to do school work on the floor in the hallway or in the principal’s office. always for fidgeting, drawing, talking to other kids, blurting things out, playing ds games, and just about anything besides staring at the teacher. All the adults in my life passed it off as I was just bored or uninterested or didn’t care. I remember crying at least once a week for feeling stupid and doing poorly in school and not being able to pay attention and getting ridiculed because I could play a video game for 15 hours straight or read a fantasy book of my choice for 3 days straight, forgetting to eat or study. Maybe it’s because I’m a girl and have a combination type so I wasn’t constantly running around? I felt so bad my whole life for something nobody ever tried to help. I’m glad I know now and can make the best of it, but has anyone else experienced things like this? Getting treated poorly and made to feel dumb before you got a diagnosis?Officially diagnosed and now realising how SHITTY adults were to me as a suffering child",1635336591,1180,213
ADHD,"Lost another job the other day. It goes like this. A boss for one reason or another develops a problem with me and begins to lecture or talk to me. But in my experience if a boss ever gets aggressive or raises their voice at me I absolutely lose it! I don’t have any issues controlling my mood in any other context and am mostly seen as a really laid back guy. But as soon as a boss or coworker yells at/insults/or harshly criticizes I get so damn angry it can result in me being fired. I also struggle heavily with embarrassment if I’m reprimanded in front of co workers. The most recent one ended in a profanity filled screaming match. Much of it I even feel was justified but still not appropriate I should have kept my mouth shut. As soon as he started to raise his voice at me and I felt like I was being judged I felt this massive swell of emotion to put my foot down so ironically screamed “do NOT yell at me, do NOT disrespect me” and his reaction to that was to throw what he had in his hands and “square up” at that point it’s bats out of hell I felt physically intimidated and at that point the argument got extremely toxic and i was fired. Idk what is wrong with me. I’ve had some total a-hole bosses but it’s my responsibility to control my conduct and in moments like those I see red and can’t stop always feel embarrassed in retrospect. I’ve looked into oppositional defiant disorder and intermittent explosive disorder. But struggle to believe I have them because I’m almost never angry. I’m calm in a crisis deal well with inconvenience and generally handle things that happen stoically enough. No road rage no rage for seemingly inconsequential things. But in about 4 or 5 occasions in my life I’ve snapped at a boss sometimes end up cussing them out and getting fired. On top of my adhd that has caused issues in the workplace this is the one things I can’t get around or understand. I’m 31 years old now and have barely ever held down a job for more than a few years.

ADHD,"Well my phone just freaked out and I lost my entire post that I was just about ready to submit :/. guess this will condense my post at least from it's original version lol. (21 F) have been recently unofficially diagnosed with ADHD (my therapist believes I have it, but not sure if I can afford an official testing for it . Not sure if insurance will cover) .  have strategies that I've developed in place to help me focus enough that I think I can get by without medication for focus. However,  biggest struggle associated with ADHD is my emotional regulation. My therapist and I have been working on it, but I don't feel like I have been improving much, especially in the moments when I need to most. On my easier days, I can maybe remember to check in with myself and to kinda regulate my emotions in conversation. But I mean my ADHD still seeps in. I tend to forget about my emotions until I'm in the moment of an emotion.  days where I'm in a really bad place though, that is when my emotions get out of control. I can freakout, have meltdowns, a lot of times over things that yes, while stressful, aren't as complicated as my brain makes them to be. It's cause me to hurt people , especially my boyfriend who tends to get the worse emotional dump rants - I still don't always get why he sticks with me and is so supportive.  when I can hyper focused on an emotion- for lack of a better term, and especially if it's on a bad day, I can cause a bit of damage.  caused me to lose a job I had a few months ago.  this portion of you don't want to read it all lol. ] had just moved to KC area , my first move. That transition to move was very hard, but I needed to be on my own to be able to focus on myself and improve myself. Granted, this job was not as great as it was presented to me. I had been hired as a housesitter of sorts, while also watching a 17 year old girl while her parents were building a home in Colorado. It offered free room and board, some food expenses paid for, and I got paid a little.bit for it on top of being able to work another part time job.  one day, the 17F had friends over. Next morning I check the basement as I always do when she had friends over. Found beer. Realized the girl wasn't home and probably drove off drunk. I freaked out. I sent upwards of 30 texts to the parents about it, sending them photos of what I found. It wasn't my job to parent the girl, at least I was under that impression cuz my role, as the parents put it, was to be more of a roommate. Well the parents got angry over the texts. And my overreaction of the situation. The girl didn't get punished, and I got fired essentially. First given 3 weeks to move out, which then after 2 days into the move out period, was told in a very angry and traumatic text to move out before the weekend or the cops would be called. &lt;&lt;&lt; of sidetrack]  anyways. My question. Does anyone here take medication for emotional regulation? If so, how is it helping you (or how has it not been helpful). I'd like to eventually find a medication that can help me so that in moments of freakout/panic modes in unfamiliar situations, I can at least focus on the facts and finding a solution, rather than being stuck on the emotion of freaking out.How do people with ADHD handle emotional regulation?

I just looked down, looked at her shirt and pointed at mine, and said “seems like you have plenty of drip.” After a pause the barista just went “no? We don’t have any!” And I had to explain the humor. noticed I really enjoy ambiguity, not just in small verbal situations where it doesn’t matter much, but in any situation— stuff like pretending to get offended because I ‘misheard’ something or reacting the wrong way. What’s frustrating is when people just seem to take it point-blank as if something’s actually wrong with me or I actually was wrong, or acting weird-when really my brain just relishes the opportunity when you’re not sure what a situation means or how to interpret it. I feel like I try not to be too judgey about it, but I noticed I can get pretty dismissive like just now when it keeps happening because otherwise people just misinterpret humor for social gaffes. do others here find there’s a healthy and appropriate place for condescension for even derision?I’m condescending when others can’t keep up with my conversation and jokes",1635336248,1190,209

ADHD,"Hello all! I'm here to vent and share feelings and thoughts about education here in the U..  am a 26 y/o male university dropout, recently diagnosed with combined type. I may continue my applied mathematics degree after I figure out my medication, but until then it's off the table for me. made it to third year before I just couldn't take it anymore. truggling with random courses for reasons that never made sense to me before being diagnosed. I always thought I didn't try hard enough. I mean, the subject matter was rarely hard for me and when it was I often found it easier to complete. what was my excuse failing my freshman year courses that everyone passed. Yes, I had reasons, but were they really legitimate? I thought I was just lazy or unmotivated as hard as I tried to pass my courses. I just needed to adjust my mindset. Who cares what my opinions are about how things should be run, academia is unforgiving by nature and so my excuses mean nothing because everyone probably struggles just as hard as me with these little things and they exist in the system to build character and adaptability. how I saw it until my diagnoses. That people just wanted it more than me. That I wasn't adaptable enough. During covid I realized that some people just can't do online school and that's okay. Then I realized maybe what was wrong with me was that... omething wasn't wrong with me. My brain just worked differently. back, I see why I was so frustrated when professors insisted that certain methods were better for students as they were more engaging. Why struggling in one class meant I failed every course that term. Let me share some courses that I truly struggled with. Japanese (don't remember the course number) - this was the worst offender and will be the longest. We used this new program called ""nigongo!"". The whole point of the class was integrated learning. We spent 4 days learning through context and images,without being allowed to speak English. We then spent one day going over written language. My. Brain. Just. Couldn't. Listening to a series of words I don't know with no English comparison is genuinely impossible for me. No matter how many times you repeat it to me, I'm not going to understand. My focus isn't strong enough to pick out each and every sound. I can barely do it with English. I was in tears as I spent sleepless nights trying to learn phrases other students learned in class. I watched the prompt scenes hundreds of times. The most progress I made was when one of the Japanese semi-teachers noticed my struggles and took me aside to help along with some other students. he really helped and explained things in English that made some things really click. My heart never felt heavier than the day I had to explain to her I was dropping out because it was too much for me. It was like she felt like she wasn't good enough because I wasn't good enough. It hurt. Chemistry 210 I think - so much memorization. When it came to foundational rules and conversions it was great. Learning how to use mol was nice. Figuring out the naming conventions for chemical compounds was fun. But Jesus, dig figs were frustrating and memorizing every element was teeth pulling. I failed my midterm because my stupid brain couldn't handle sigfigs. We had to do midterm reviews and I had to explain ""yeap, knew the concept and understood. I was super diligent to make sure I didn't get the sigfigs wrong, but since I can't use more zeros than necessary I guess I just have to get gud?"" Physics 201 - too many students. Even the whispers completely detached me from the class material. I probably could have passed this one regardless, but my student loans came in late so I didn't have course materials until 4 weeks in. ome health class: the whole course was about healthy life choices and homework consisted of remembering to record things and do things on a schedule. I struggle with this as it is and since I don't like lying, I failed this course hardcore when I brought empty fill out sheets. Math 252 - teacher was nice and incredibly funny. He never went into detail as to why we did things though, just their history or why they were important. He was probably incredibly engaging to the other students. But his tangents made me lose focus too often. I didn't get to figure out the why and so I struggled to apply theorems to exams. Math 254: failing this class was frustrating. The professor was dynamic in his speech and detailed in his written work. The only reason I failed this course was because he had an accent. It's so dumb but it's true. I really struggled because I had to focus so hard to catch what he was saying that I couldn't take notes. He posted all the notes online, but my work and other classwork meant that redoing notes meant not doing homework. a journey to remind myself that these failures are as much my fault as they are the professors of those courses, which is to say not at all. But we pay so much money for college education that I wish that there were classes designed with the ADHD brain in mind. thanks for reading ya'll. It feels good to write this all out. If you made it to the end, congratulations. I wrote a lot of nothing haha.I feel like academia is not very ADHD friendly",1635332293,5245,948

I find it helpful when I have to take down every single word that's being said in the meeting and I thought that I'll apply this to lessons as well. Excessive?! Yes. But I don't intend to reread them, it's just to keep me focused. At most I'll do up a summary and revise that instead.2. **Breaking work up into ridiculously small chunks** : Eg. plit my 1000-words essay into 200-words chunks, and motivate myself with the fact that I'm allowed to take a short break after each chunk!!!! (Although 200-words is still a struggle.. how is that possible?! BUt good enough I guess) OR Doing 15-20 minutes worth of work each time3. **Timing my breaks** : Ok I made the mistake of getting carried away during my breaks and losing track of time. Going to start setting alarms.4. **Identifying distractions** : For me it can be anything.. even if I throw my phone far far away and out of sight, I find myself developing a sudden interest in my apple pencil instead......... But hey at least 90% of my distractions are gone (plus my phone is the biggest rabbit hole)5. **Being as lazy as possible** : top overcommitting (applies to both social gatherings and acads) because I'll end up forgetting/ flaking on 99% of it when I'm overwhelmed6. **top studying with new people** : (this is for exams/ finals period when I can't afford to be distracted) Isn't it fun to find out that a new friend of yours that you're studying with has ADHD OR tends to talk (about irrelevant things) during study sessions? 7. **Don't study the same subject / module for hours** : witch the moment you get bored, don't be too hung up about the fact that you're halfway through a certain assignment / lecture / homework / tutorial8. **You don't have time** : TOP THINKING YOU DO!!!!! &gt;:( 9. **Do something immediately if you suddenly remember it, if you're not in the middle of a task** : What often happens to me - I think to myself ""Ok I'll text person A about this later"" or ""I'll check my calendar later"" or ""I'll add this to my calendar later"", and I happily forget all about it. If you're in a middle of a task I guess you can add use a post-it or add it to your to-do list (immediately)10. **Google Calendar** : or any calendar that is synced with all your devices / stored in the cloud tbh.. used to be a big fan of physical calendars because I can make it nice and pretty, but really.. it takes too much effort to get up, take a few steps (or many more), attempt to find the physical calendar (or realize you don't have it on you), and even if you do, fiND A pEn to wRite dOwn that new task / commitment that you're never going to check anyway. Checking your calendar daily is so much easier when it's just a few clicks away and you can continue lying on your bed 11. **To-do lists** : ok this one isn't working out so well for me so far.. but still going to give it a chance because it might just be because I'm unable to focus and end up crossing off only one item on the list.. repeat that every day and I have a mountain of backlog at the end of the week12. **BONU** : [ Apart from this, there's another tool that deletes your work if don't hit a certain word count within the time limit that you set, but I can't find it.. Personally find this a bit extreme??! But a friend's friend swears by it (and apparently has pretty good grades too)ADD/ADHD Studying Tips and Tricks / Hacks / Lifesavers",1635331287,4825,877

ADHD,"I have always struggled with this issue, but the past year has been especially difficult. I don’t believe I’m bipolar because I don’t seem to experience mania, however my mood changes nearly every hour. I could wake up happy and then with no trigger it feels as if all the life got sucked out of me, like all the erotonin and dopamine just left me. My body becomes heavy, my mind gets foggy, I’m just empty. I’m on lexapro, but it doesn’t work. I’ve taken many ADHD meds in my life and they all have led to severe anxiety, however at the same time do provide happiness and motivation that seems to suddenly go away shortly after it kicks in. I was prescribed Vyvanse recently and I took 20mg for the first time yesterday morning and I felt incredible. For an hour. Then the high of feeling motivated, talkative, and joyful slowly faded away and turned into anxiety, then it turned into a crash and at 5pm I felt empty. o I took another, and I felt fantastic again; I decided to smoke a little ouid, and had some alcohol and this combination made me feel more relaxed than I have ever been in my life…I am always anxious, it never stops, even when drunk, even while high, but something about having all 3 meds in my system just like “fixed” all of that? I could think clearly and there wasn’t this fog over my mind for the first time in quite awhile. Why can’t I feel this way sober?? Has anyone also experienced that sudden drain of emotion and if you have, how do you make it stop? I’m so frustrated that adhd meds don’t seem to last long in my system and I’m not really sure what to do.

ADHD,"In my state it's legal over 21 to enjoy... cilantro, and I've been trying gummies made with it out to help my sleep since both my anxiety and adhd makes it hard to go to sleep and stay asleep. went to my new campus doctor and was informed that  when they, or at least my new doctor, does drug screenings and tests, they won't give controlled substances like my adhd meds if I have ""cilantro"" in my system. I have to wait 30 days (I know it'll probably be out of my system before then, but its just to be safe) to get my meds refilled and I'm terrified because I'm a student.

ADHD,"Hey, first reddit post so I’m hoping I’m doing this right. I have been prescribed dexamphetamine 40mg per day (4 tablets, twice a day) for two years now. I was prescribed this for the first time in hospital 2 years ago along with Effexor and I have not had any changes to the dose since I was given it the first time. In the past 6-9 months I’ve noticed a dramatic increase in brain fog, lethargy and the amount of sleep I get each night. I feel able to concentrate but unable to think quickly, my reaction times are incredibly slow - slower than I have ever experienced in my life. I take an excessively long time to do everything no matter the task, this I have never experienced before. My health is in fine condition, I’ve done the blood tests, and many other types of testing as I assumed these effects must be health related considering I’m on these stimulants. I have always slept a lot but in the past few months I find I often fall asleep shortly after taking dex and go on to sleep for long periods after taking my usual doses regardless of having slept 9 hours straight the night before. I do have an appointment with my psych coming up which I’ll discuss it again with him. Have mentioned some of these symptoms before but I assumed it was an iron deficiency or something. Last time we talked he said he thinks I will be on this medication for many many years. I know no one can give me medical advice don’t worry, I just want to know if anyone has experienced even one of the symptoms I talked about. Being on pretty decent strength stimulant medications I feel defective that I’m having these symptoms. (If it helps I’m 19F - don’t smoke, drink or have coffee, healthy diet, haven’t made any real lifestyle changes. The reason I suspect dex is because these symptoms occur within 45 minutes of taking it specifically although that might be a coincidence somehow?)Effects of Dexamphetamine becoming adverse over time?",1635327702,1930,351
ADHD,TRAVEL QUETION hello I know this may be a long shot but was wondering if anyone had any experience travelling with prescription medication around outh East Asia? am moving to New York City end of January however I was hoping to do a month in Vietnam (obvs depending on what happens with borders). I will be taking 6 months worth of Ritalin over to the U; however I know it's probably not possible to take this much into Vietnam. I've tried calling the embassy and Googling but haven't received any concrete answers. I know in Thailand you can only bring in 30 days worth of prescription - period - but not sure if other E Asia countries have similar rules?

ADHD,"It seems like every day for the past month or so has brought with it some variation of the same old bullshit- and it’s getting pretty exhausting. Like- literally, I am fucking TIRED. Here’s basically what an average day will go like for me: - Wake up, pop 50mg Vyvanse - “hit- still tired, better crack open an energy drink” - Vyvanse kicks in so it’s WORK TIME BABY WOOOO Vyvanse starts to wear off so it’s ANXIETY TIME BABY NOOOOO - “I could pass out at any second so it’s time for another energy drink” - ECOND WIND BABY WOOOO - “well now my brain is totally fried, I should take a break, watch some TV and eat some food” - “fuck that lasted longer than expected.. oh well, I guess it’s bed time” - “yep, no chance I’m falling asleep right now even though I’m completely exhausted.

ADHD,"TW: Brief mention of s3lf harm I´ve been trying to get diagnosed for a fucking while now. It always goes wrong. I don´t know if I´m making it all up anymore.  time when I brought up my issues with distractivenes and executive dysfunction she said she couldn´t do anything about it and was like, ""so you lack motivation?"" when I said 100 times that it´s not that. If it´s already difficult for me to bring up what concerns me like you are so eager to point out, maybe the fact that I bring it up means it´s important to me? Like I can´t fucking function dude. Rn it´s not that bad but stress can build up really fast in me when things start piling up. And it´s starting to happen yet again.  yeah. No. she said there were more urgent matters, like my personality disorder and sh. What they don´t understand is that it´s difficult for me to fucking cope with the anxiety of the consecuences of my adhd symptoms and that´s partly why I resort to shit like that. Also she´s always talking about how my impulsivity is dangerous.. sorry? I literally scored high on ADHD on a test she gave me and I´m constantly bringing up related issues. Why do you keep ignoring it?? Why do you attribute it to BPD symptoms? Therapists and psychiatrists are so eager to call out bpd the moment there is a patient with a history of self harm, no matter the context.  yeah she was practically screaming the other day about how I could not be unmedicated with my impulsiveness. And by that she meant putting me on benzos again... she forced my psychiatrist to prescribe me something even though he clearly thought it wasn´t needed. I ended up getting prescribed fluoxetine ( Which i¨m not fucking taking lol) All this in the context of testing positive for a few personality disorders... personality disorders are NOT supposed to be treated with medication for the most part. You are NOT a doctor, stick to your field. Last session she basically kicked me out because she said I wasn´t very collaborative and was too walled off and that I was too complicated for hear to deal with and that she couldn,t do anything about me. Then she called me yesterday saying she didn´t mean it and I should go to therapy today. No way. The worst part is how ableist she was. he literally said autistic people have no empathy  (¿) Yeah.

I was a very good attentive listener at school. I was rather inattentive outside classroom. I am also someone who is very impulsive with feelings but very very restrained with typical adhd impulsiveness like driving or money.  things made me and the psychiatrists not sure whether i have it.

It does not help that most practitioners spend like 15 minutes max to diagnose, which is kinda crazy here but I live in a small town in the north of Germany, so I cannot find anything better for now.  last psychiatrist decided to try a low dose ling acting stimulant and see whether there is any effect. 3 weeks in now and i can definitely feel much more focused, less angry and way less depressed.

ADHD,I got pushed from Ritalin 10 IR to 20 IR and i can feel my heart beating strong and fast. I check sometimes and it actually goes a lot faster now. 10 IR helped me so well to calm down and focus but 20 IR is making my heart pound which makes me nervous.I even focus on my heart now when the Ritalin wears off and it still makes me nervous. I never felt my heart beating.I think this is an anxiety thing. trying to stay cool as much as i can.

ADHD,"I know there is a structure change, but what exactly it is? It's hard for me to summarize in languages. aced everything in middle school and high school (I got punished and shamed by teachers a lot because I frequently forgot to do homework, but my scripts and AT scores are great,) but in college, I got a bunch of Bs and Cs and Ds, while my study habit didn't change -- zoom out during the class sometimes, self-taught after class, procrastinate on assignments, and cram before exams. This strategy just doesn't work for college. don’t think that's because what I study in college is... too hard for me to self educate/ cram. After all, there are several random midterms/ finals I did really well that made the whole class unable to get a curve. I just, don’t know why. It’s like rolling a dice. I thought to myself it must be some structural differences that make my college life difficult. I spent most of the time studying and left no time for socializing and sleeping, but my grades still suck. Is it because there is a steady daily agenda in high school so that you don’t have to spend time planning things out, and it’s easier for you to keep track of the coursework because you and your peers are doing the same thing? I really don’t know. I think it’s more than that. else getting the same experience? I really wanna know why. I’m really confused.What is the structural difference between colleges and high schools?

ADHD,"Hey everyone, little introduction to understand what I'm looking for.  browsing this subreddit since a year or so, and adhd social media groups. One thing coming up quite often, the struggle of a lot of persons with planners and such.  was forced to work from home again due to an injury, and I knew after two weeks at home I'd have to reorganize myself to go back in the office, scared I would forget my key card, bus card or whatever I didn't used at home. Anyway I thought again about these apps and how I barely use some of them because too many notifications I just swipe, and don't use after a week at max.  in IT, I though it would be nice to have a simple checkup app for my daily morning routine or daily tasks. If I could add some kind of rewarding dopamine rush like a Pokemon mile app to brush your teeth, why not. omething that makes you enjoy it kinda. o why not trying to make one a bit different, more.. adapted.I'm brainstorming at the moment, and my partner gently told me to raise some questions with other fellow adhd/asd mates.  short now, my questions are: what do you like and don't like in these apps, what cool feature can I add while keeping this simple and enjoyable. me if there is some typo or grammar errors, English isn't my first language.  and enjoy your day :)How well are you organizing with planner apps",1635320287,1339,250

ADHD,"It's really hard to deal with it for some reason this week. I keep trying to remind myself I'm not actually stupid. I moved to a different country with a completely different language and after two years started a degree learning only in this language that I've had max 2 or 3 years experience learning. I don't understand everything and sometimes other people don't understand me (because of my accent and idk why else). I've been trying really hard to go against the ADHD despite running out of meds. I go to sleep as early as possible, I make my food ahead of time, I try to do my homework as soon as possible. It's been four weeks. I honestly have no idea how I've managed not too badly so far. Yet I feel so stupid when I don't understand something and I ask about it and they don't understand my question and sometimes laugh or misrepresent what I said so that I feel like I end up looking stupid in front of the whole class. It already takes me courage to even get the professor's attention. I'm also afraid that even when I'm not frustrated I sound angry because of my Russian accent. And maybe when I'm frustrated that people don't understand me maybe it comes across as aggressive, so I definitely need to modulate my responses. But for some reason this week it's been extra frustrating. I'm also afraid to complain because I start hearing myself and start realizing I probably sound so negative and/or unstable.

ADHD,"Hey! I’m 25F and currently in the process of getting diagnosed and while I can relate to most posts on here, there are some things that make me doubt whether or not I have it. why I wanted to ask some questions to ppl who are already diagnosed: I read a lot about being late to appointments etc. Do you sometimes get anxious about the possibility of being late and arrive to the appointment earlier just to wait outside For 2hrs? Can you imagine things easily? I can think about sad things and it seems so real I can start crying. Or while doing guided meditation I get into my head so much that sometimes it gets scary.  Do you make plans with someone and get super excited about it but when it’s time to actually do it, you don’t want to and cancel the plans?  Do you feel like it’s difficult to make friends because you have weird expectations? I can’t be friends with someone who isn’t similar to me or who seems to be too normal.  Did you do well in school? I didn’t have issues in school. I was bad at math, good at writing and stuff. I did use to “go away” from home and stuff like that sometimes.  you so much for taking the time to answer to these questions. I hope it’s not too many or too overwhelming to read/answer.

ADHD,"I feel like this is true for a lot of things but showers are non-negotiable so it one I focused really hard on to overcome. as a woman, taking a shower can feel like a HUGE undertaking. If I had to wash/dry/style my hair, shave, exfoliate, moisturize, etc. etc. etc. every time I took a shower I would almost never do it. It takes a lot of time.

Obviously I will have to wrap myself in ten blankets and play Xbox until my body temp is just right. I most often take a “lazy” shower. I put my hair up in a bun so it doesn’t get wet, and I literally wash my butt and armpits, and jump right out. It takes so little time and effort. Dry time is minimal because my hair stays dry.

ADHD,"Hello! I recently quit taking trattera (more like 3ish months ago but it took a while to fully exit my body) and while there’s plenty of posts from people on it, I cannot seem to find any posts whatsoever about people who have quit this medication. Here’s my thoughts/experiences! No more “non-threatening” seizures when I would skip/forget a dose. For some reason it would always happen when I was asleep/nearly asleep. When I wasn’t being consistent I dreaded bedtime because I knew there was a good chance I would tweak out. My emotional capacity is fully restored. This is both a good thing and a bad thing. The good part is the ability to be more heartfelt, empathetic and vulnerable with my partner. The difficult part is relearning how to handle my overwhelming emotions/rejection dysphoria.  My anxiety has returned but on a lesser scale. I no longer have that pillow from the medication, but after tweaking my daily habits (limiting caffeine intake, daily exercise, meditation etc) I have become able to conquer it. No more laser focus. Kind of a no brainer. Much bigger appetite yet… faster metabolism? Hear me out. On trattera, I couldn’t handle eating much more than a proper breakfast and a pathetic dinner, yet my body was incredibly stubborn and would either lose nearly undetectable amounts of weight or nothing at all. The past two months, I have been eating RAVENOULY in comparison (ravenously meaning like, three meals a day and a snack/dessert. Y’know, like people are supposed to do).

ADHD,"Hello guys,  I am in my 20s F and I recently got diagnosed (like 3 days ago) with ADHD (PI) and AD with the help of my university. I currently live in HK. And I am in my final year majoring in creative media. here is the story always kinda knew I had ADHD and AD but it never really bothered me up until my mental health started deteriorating after a sexual harassment incident, the experience caused me to have anxiety and depressive issues and as time went by it also affected my grades.  Luckily, my college advisor was there to help but here comes the problem, while I was waiting for my diagnosis. I started relapsing again which has caused me to miss a lot of my lectures and assignment this sem  (my advisor/no one knows abt this). At first, I was anxious about how the students and the professor will view me as and then let's just say I lost all my ""mojo"". It's week nine, I am happy and lost because I finally know my diagnosis and this time I am ready to get back up and get proper help. But I'm worried about my grades, I barely attended any lectures and I cannot afford to extend another year but I finally got an approval from uni for special educational needs like getting extra time for exams/assgs. My advisor wants me to email all my professors regarding my EN case but Idk what to say to my professors. I am actually embarrassed of my behaviour but I wasn't myself idk what to do.

ADHD,"I have been hearing a lot of “talk to your doctor about adult ADHD” ads lately where they say things like “are you often distracted or impulsive?” I got to thinking about what that looks like in my life.  could describe me even on a good day. ometimes I can only give like 85% of my attention but I’m working on it.  is weird, because it’s always made me think of a TV character that impulsively spends a bunch of money, kisses someone, takes a trip etc. I’m sure people out there can relate to that but I really can’t. I’m like an “over-prepper” I won’t do something/go places like that unless I’m planning on it, prepared, &amp; ready. It like bothers me if I don’t micromanage shit like that.

When I want to take a poorly timed nap, procrastinate, go back to sleep, doom scroll, bad habits etc (often when I’m supposed to be studying) it’s like I can’t tell myself no. I thought about this as “impulsive” behavior, and it sort of clicked.  soon as I think about veering away from what I’m supposed to be doing, I’m already completely sidetracked. And usually I can’t reel myself back in very easily. hoping that by being able to almost label those things as “impulsive” I can try to be mindful of them as I work towards my goals of better time management.  anyone found success like this?

ADHD,"I've been having a really difficult time with controlling my irritability lately, and have very little motivation. I've had many people suggest meditation. I've read many articles, tried downloading those meditation apps, watched videos, but I just don't understand how to meditate. I've tried doing the whole 'pay REALLY close attention to your breathing', I've tried using music, I've tried sitting in a dark, quiet room, and even sitting next to a creek in a forest and just listening to all the sounds. I don't understand what it's supposed to accomplish. It doesn't ever give me a feeling of stress relief. I've been told that it's not about keeping a clear head, but I feel like there's just no such thing as just treating my thoughts 'like clouds'. Grounding techniques have never helped me get out of my head. I can feel a rock and pay attention to how it feels, how much it weighs, and it's temperature, but it just becomes a another train of thought that's happening at the same time. Trying to ground myself, when sitting or laying down, and trying to meditate, becomes hell. It just adds to my awareness of my growing pent up frustration of being still, and it doesn't take long before 'just let the feeling being there', is just not an option anymore because my body becomes far too uncomfortable to handle and I have to move because aggravation just takes over. if I'm just doing something wrong, but I just don't get this whole mindfulness thing.

Then all of a sudden, I started feeling like a rush to my head which made me wanna listen to music, then lo and behold all those shit thoughts from literally 2 minutes ago vanished and I was jamming out to my potify saved songs. No it wasn’t the music that caused this, there’s been times where I’ve tried listening to music to fill the void of emptiness and it did absolutely nothing; this time there was something triggered psychologically which made everything feel FINE AND GREAT and like I was on top of the world.

Anyways, another reason it’s hard to tell is also because they both were very good at schooling and have and are still pursuing in degrees (masters).

ADHD,"Hey fellow brains, just wanted to rant a little. doc treating my ADHD wants me to ""just"" find a psychiatrist (as if I'd be seeing that doc if I could!). story short:** doctor prescribing me Adderall only extended my prescription by 2 weeks, and expects me to find and see a psychiatrist in this time span. Because it's ""not hard"", and it will take me ""five minutes"" to just get a list of specialists from my insurance, select one, make calls, schedule an appointment, and not miss it.You know, the the things that are the easiest with ADHD. /s story longer**:  got diagnosed with ADHD in May by 2 providers (yay!) at age 34 (took a while, but yay!) and got an Adderall prescription (life-changing!). I stayed with Circle, the provider that diagnosed me first. They are the first to come up when you Google ADHD treatment in California; and specifically say they help with Adult ADHD diagnostics. doc that diagnosed me was great, and I felt like I was heard and understood. My life has changed for the better in the course of a month or two; I wrote it up in [my ADHD diagnosis story]( (The rest of that [ADHD wiki]( is the stuff that prompted me to get the diagnosis in the first place). she left practice unexpectedly, and I was left hanging (Circle wouldn't give me any further information). o I made a few appointments with another doctor on the app. new doctor was nice and supportive, but my case isn't the easiest: Adderall helps me a lot, but also makes me sleepy if I take 10mg at once. o I take 3-5mg throughout the day - when I don't forget (which I do often). 10mg XR makes me take a nap. 5mg AdderallXR works for me, but isn't enough. I need 20-30mg a day if I want to continue functioning the way I am expected to by my employer in particular. I asked if I could mix XR with immediate release (like, 3x5mg XR pills and 3 immediate release) instead of 30mg immediate release, or 10mg XR + 20 immediate release.  doc told me it's not usual for anyone to be prescribed several XR pills unless in extreme cases, and that she thinks I need my anxiety managed better, that ""it's called"" generalized anxiety disorder, and that I should see a psychiatrist to get it under control. That Adderall isn't an anxiety medication, and ""we just want to be sure"" I'm getting the right care. he is extending my prescription by two weeks. was like, do you expect me to find a psychiatrist in two weeks? said yeah, I should ""just"" call the insurance, and then ""just"" call the numbers they give me, and ""just"" make an appointment, and ""just"" have it in two weeks, and it will ""just"" take me **""five minutes""** and that another patient in the area had no problem doing the same. to recap, she expects an **ADHD patient**, who has an **attention deficit**, a **deficit** of **attention**, and struggles with [Executive Dysfunction](romankogan.net/adhd#Executive%20Dysfunction) to ""just"" find and make an appointment with a psychiatrist in **five minutes**, because *someone else* could do it, so what's the fuss about it? that I've never struggled with anxiety. I did. That's why I'm on 200mg of ertraline. I know what anxiety feels like real well. That's why I'm taking ertraline. I also know what ADHD is, because ertraline did not help me with that, and Adderall does. Gee figure, being anxious about being unable to do things can be addressed by **BEING ABLE TO DO THING**. you know what **gives** me anxiety? Having to unexpectedly go through the entire process of finding a qualified mental health professional, explaining myself, spending a ton of money - things that are hard for me **BECAUE I HAVE ADHD** - all for no good reason whatsoever.  didn't get to say any of it. he said she has to take the next patient, and will call me back (she didn't).  and did I mention I'm likely autistic, and am **so. damn. tired** of people not getting that my **tone** does not always reflect my **state of mind**? Because I have no clue what else she could have been going off of by telling me I have ""generalized anxiety disorder"" after talking to me for 15 minutes.  I wrote her as short a message as you'd expect from an autistic/ADHD kid. haring it here, because I'm pretty sure nobody at the clinic will read it, but maybe some of y'all will relate.  Dr. M**, didn't finish the conversation earlier today; when would be a good time to continue it? You said you can call at lunch, so I'll be waiting until further notice. In the meantime, I'll try to summarize what I didn't have time to say. unfortunately, I was not in a good environment to take the call today: the cat made a ruckus, and my wife entered the room during the appointment and started talking to me. I ask her not to do that, but she sometimes forgets. ADHD makes it difficult for me to handle interruptions and talking to multiple people at the same time, so I felt overwhelmed, and could not focus on telling you about my experience since we met last time. we spent about five minutes (out of about 20) talking about how it's easy (or not) to find a psychiatrist. Unfortunately, this distracted me from what I was trying to say, and I focused on this instead (because ADHD - and I didn't take meds before the appointment, because my meeting at work ran over, and I was running late). It somewhat hurt to hear you say that it would take me ""five minutes"" to call the doctors on the list of providers the insurance would give me. Last time, it took me 20+ minutes of hold time just to get that list. And that's without getting into billing issues (the psychiatrist I talked to last year wouldn't send me bills or receipts, and delayed paperwork my work needed from her by two months, resulting in more red tape to go through).  you would know that ADHD makes inherently difficult to deal with forms, bureaucracy, appointments, insurance, etc. It took me three years to find myself a primary care doctor. Ten years to make an appointment to a dentist. I have a PhD in Mathematics, but I never picked up my high school diploma because I had to pay the library fines and come on time to do it. I've paid countless late fees, and missed out on reimbursements just because I had a form to fill and a call to make. I got a present for my friend in 2010, and mailed in in 2020 because contacting my friend, writing down the address, packing it, going to the post office, and mailing it involved enough steps that her address changed in the meantime... five times. I have never, not once in my life have **NOT** been stressed by something like that. took me four months to seek out treatment with Circle after I realized that my problems come from ADHD. Out of things that ADHD makes it difficult for me, this is one of the hardest. It has always been a source of stress and and anxiety. Adderall makes it easier, but not easy. I need to ask you to be mindful of the challenges I am facing as someone with ADHD. That's why I asked you if you could refer me to a psychiatrist. I have been taking autism self-assessment tests, and scoring high on each of them. Getting a formal assessment would cost me $2500, which I don't want to spend right now. One of the traits - and I've been told this by many people about myself - is that my emotional state often does match my facial expression and tone. I run into this issue on a daily basis with my wife and at work, unless I take effort to ""smile and wave"". My former manager literally told me ""I don't know how to interpret your body language""; I didn't know what to tell him except to ignore it. I feel like this could be useful for you to know that if you use it as a signal in our conversations. while the relationship with my mother is a source of stress, at least I have control over it now, because I have come to the point where I am comfortable limiting the amount of interaction with her. he is getting mental healthcare, and she is getting better; our interactions are getting better. They are still stressful, but I don't want to lose them, especially after losing my father in early 2020. And reading accounts of other children of people with borderline personality disorders (and my own, from a year ago), there is a drastic change in how they are going now. That said, I am mindful of how these interactions affect me; so I limit them when I notice that they are taking a toll (like last weekend - I have not spoken to my mom since). This is something my therapist helps me with, too (and also, something ertraline helped me *a lot* with). I am rather confused why you would conclude that I need to manage my anxiety better. Anxiety, currently, is not something that is an issue for me at all. It *has been* in the past, and that's why I sought care for it in the first place. ertraline really helped with it; with 100mg/day I was feeling less anxious than I have been in years, and when I went up to 200mg/day with Dr. A this summer, I have stopped observing it, and I can happily tell that it's not an impediment in my life. I don't feel anxious when I don't have a *task* to complete *right now*. Things going on in the past or the future aren't making me feel uneasy; it's **doing** a task **right now** that does. Completing a project at work is a task, but so is leaving house on time for band practice - or looking for a psychiatrist :)  I **am** struggling with right now is initiating tasks, switching between these tasks, and paying attention. There are several reasons why I am struggling with it currently more than when I talked to you last time. Here are the changes that happened in my life since then: Me and my partner are trying to buy a house, and we have to close within two weeks. Very few places worked for both of us within the budget that we have, so we both really want for the deal to work out. However, the bank is running late with the appraisal and processing the loan, so we're running out of time and have to respond to all requests immediately to have a chance of securing the deal. For the past two weeks, I had to deal with constant interruptions, filling out forms, finding documents, talking to the realtor, bankers, and constantly be on call waiting for the bank to remember that they need such-and-such proof of funds that I have to request and submit to them. As I said above, this is inherently difficult with ADHD (doing things NOW, paying attention to detail in forms, filling forms on time, following byzantine instructions, and doing what I feel is stupid work many times over: proving that I **can** pay what I am **already** paying in rent). I get messages from the banker from 9AM till 1AM, and am expected to respond fast. My manager at work was unhappy with my communication and work style (particularly, procrastinating on ""boring"" tasks, getting distracted and working on multiple more interesting projects at once, not delivering the results on time, not completing projects at all at other times, taking too long to respond to messages, having a prioritization of tasks that doesn't align with my assignments). As you know, literally ALL of those are ADHD symptoms. Last week, my manager gave me a surprise meeting with the HR, where he gave me a long ultimatum, which included, among other things, that not responding to his messages within 15 minutes three times in a calendar month is grounds for immediate termination. I negotiated it down to 60 minutes. While I don't think this is entirely unreasonable, it does require me to PAY ATTENTION to messages from 9am to 6pm, respond promptly, estimate time, prioritize, and not procrastinate, at the threat of immediate termination (..and losing the house if it happens this month). Previously, they had me on probation for the same reasons; however, there is no complaint about the quality of my work when it's finally done. Last week, I started playing with a new band. I have been playing with bands for several years, but it's the first time since COVID. I love music, and it's something that is both a creative outlet, self-care, and meditation for me. But playing with a band is like 80% organization and 20% musicianship. It requires A LOT of executive function skills. Just to get to the practice, I need to pack my gear that I use at home (disconnect all the cables, put cables, adapters, extension cords in a bag), load gear into the car, unload the gear at the destination, set up all the equipment, and be on time. That alone is a huge challenge for me. After practice, I have to do it in reverse. Then there is: remembering the set list, following the plan we had for how we play each song, when to switch instruments, when the chorus and the break comes, and so on. When you play with someone long enough, you learn to read and give each other cues; but we are all just starting to practice together, so I have to rely on structure and memorization just avoid playing the bridge when everyone else is playing the chorus. It takes all the executive functioning I have to keep up with live gigs; with my previous bands, recording several tracks meant I effectively didn't have the ability to do anything else (because recording comes with too much ""homework"" of nailing down everything before coming to the studio, and then being involved in mixing and mastering). But this band is not too organized, so yesterday's practice got scheduled on unday, and the set list is changing all the time. Again, I have to keep track of messages, be responsive, do tasks (like learning songs), and do everything on time because the performance day is not a moveable deadline. of the above is hard; and I am thankful that I have found how to navigate it all - both with help from my therapist, and medication. But since I have been taking the ADHD meds for just about half a year, I am still learning how to use them. And forgetting to take them - which I still do, because ADHD makes it difficult to remember - means I take too much time to pack gear, run late to the practice, and then apologize to everyone and try to not make them feel disrespected (which, I've been told, people do when I'm late - and I'm late all the time). That's one example of a situation where having the immediate release Adderall helps: ""OH HIT we have a practice in an hour"". I don't have an hour for the meds to kick in when I need to do a task with many steps, like remembering which cable goes with which device to make the sound. over the course of the past six months, I have learned that Adderall is a great asset in dealing with the situations above. It really helps a lot. o the anxiety that I have that came from struggling with task initiation, completion, and timeliness is greatly reduced. With your, and Dr. A's help, I feel like we found the amount that works for me - 20 to 30mg daily. What I've been trying to figure out is the best way to take it, since I have a paradoxical response to taking 10mg of either extended or immediate release: it makes me sleepy. Asking around in the ADHD community, I have found that it is not too uncommon. People told me that they just struggle staying awake for an hour, and then do the tasks that they need to do. I hoped to find a mix of immediate and extended release that would work for me without making me sleepy. I have found that taking small amounts (5mg or less) of immediate release at regular intervals (every 3 hours) works great for me (I usually sleep from 2AM to 8AM, so it works out to 30mg/day), with the downside that if I am focusing on a task at the time when I'm supposed to take it, I have to choose between interrupting the task (and risk not completing it, because switching is difficult) or completing the task (and risk forgetting to take the pill). Yes I have a pill box, and it's still a problem. 10mg XR would have worked great if it didn't release so much upfront. 5mgXR works better, but tapers out faster, so I'd need several. I understand that it's not common to prescribe immediate and extended release like that, but neither my life, nor the way my body processes Adderall are. any case, the current prescription of (5mgXR x 30 + 10mg x 75 immediate release)/month does work for me, though I feel  that (5mgXR x 60 + 10mg x 60) would work even better -- note that it's the same daily amount, just balanced differently. I take it ""as needed"" because I try to take *less* than 30 mg each day to avoid developing a tolerance to the drug in the long term; so I try avoid taking it if I know I can avoid doing tasks that day. There hasn't been such a day in the past month though. taking all of the above into account, I don't understand how specifically I can benefit from seeking out a psychiatrist at this moment. Neither of the following situations is addressed with psychiatric care or medication:  * potentially losing a deal on a house that we were trying to get for a long time  * potentially getting fired from a decent job  * potentially messing up during a show in front of a live audience know *exactly* how each of these feels, because I have been through ALL of that before: missed out on a deal because I couldn't focus on forms, had to quit a job for not completing a project I didn't find rewarding (...or ethical), and messing up on stage because I wasn't focused enough during practices. It was a great revelation to me to understand *why* I've been failing in this particular manner all my life, in spite of being successful in other ways. It was also mind-blowing to find out there's a pill for that. have started seeking care with Circle specifically for my ADHD, because Circle advertised as a service to help people with ADHD. I did get a second opinion from Done First, and they recommended the same medication (Adderall or AdderallXR); I went with Circle because I felt that Dr. A understood my issues better.  I must say, it has been a great experience. My employer was extremely dissatisfied with my perforamnce at work when I first started getting treated from ADHD here, and by now I have accomplished enough at my job that at the very least, my managemer is willing to work with my ADHD symptoms, even though they are specifically unhappy about them. I have solved problems that nobody else could solve, and did that within the timeframe we agreed on. effectiveness of the treatment was why Dr. A felt comfortable giving me a prescription for, if I recall correctly, 2-3 months. My expectation is that this is what we are working towards here. My understanding is that this is the typical frequency, and we are meeting more often to fine-tune the way I take the prescribed medication. I feel like a recommendation to seek a psychiatrist from my insurance must have come from a misunderstanding coming from me being uncomfortable to communicate in the presence of unfortunate interruptions, and not having enough time to describe everything above. that I did get a chance to talk at length with Dr. A during my intake appointment, but we didn't get to have a conversation like that after switching away from Dr. A due to her leaving practice. Therefore, I felt the need to write the above assessment to compensate for this and bring us all to the same page. light of the above, please let me know how I can help you provide care to me by using the system I am already familiar with and had a positive experience with (unlike my insurance, which left me out to dry). would any of the following be an option, or is helpful/necessary: scheduling more time with you (Dr. M) talking to another provider in Circle who focuses on ADHD care talking to a psychiatrist on Circle (in which case, I still need help from you with understanding  what exactly I'd need from them, and, ideally, support team scheduling this for me). hope this provides enough context for you. taying with the doctor that has already treated me is obviously better than switching to someone unfamiliar with me, and having to explain everything all over.  you, and please let me know if you have read this message (...I have no idea whether these messages get to you directly -- support team, if you are reading this, please forward to Dr. M!).  so much, and looking forward to the next time we talk.My prescribing doctor wants me to ""just"" find and see a psychiatrist within 2 weeks",1635305872,20149,3669

ADHD,"Hi everyone. Recently, I've come to the realization that I may have ADHD, or at least am experiencing some of the symptoms but I'm also beginning to doubt myself wondering if I'm just making myself think that I am. I've taken several of those tests online and most if not all have turned back with the possibility of ADD/ADHD. I also feel like it provides an explanation for a bunch of things in my life, but I'm also afraid that maybe I'm making it up or that if I talk to my GP about it that I may be told that I'm fine, even though I feel like something's not right. ome things that I've been experiencing for years are: Often running late because I overestimate the amount of time I have to spare* Whenever I leave my house, about 90% of the time I end up going back inside because I forgot something, or think I did* I'm unable to just sit down and study. I actually don't recall having studied much throughout my school years. I would just coast by with what I did remember or picked up on and would pass all of my classes that way. Lately I've been studying for a certification exam approaching in a few days and it feels like it's impossible to sit down and really study without ending up on youtube, or social media, or playing video games* peaking of video games: Growing up I had a phase where I was addicted to video games. To the point that I would forget to eat and would in turn get scolded by my parents, but to their defense, I was underweight for a while. * pans of time where I'm really into a video game so I'll log on right after work without fail, play for hours and lose track of time, thus forgetting to eat, putting off using the bathroom for hours because I don't want to stop doing whatever I'm doing. Conversely, other times I completely lack motivation to partake in any of my hobbies.* pending hours upon hours researching something I'm interested in. ie. recently bought a new computer and watched a ton of reviews prior to and after purchasing it. To the point where I would stay up for hours even when I had to go to school or work just to continue researching or watching videos.* Being asked by my O to do something and forgetting soon after, or not following instructions. * General forgetfulness that's all off the top of my head right now.

It used to work GREAT. I would be focused all day and could sit for hours and knock out my homework. Now, it takes me 2 hours to even get started on my work and i have a window of about 4-6 hours to get work done before my brain turns into a walnut.  as one could expect, my day is jampacked with things i need to be doing for school...like I have 3 research papers, 2 lab reports, and a huge data presentation project coming up in the next few weeks and I know i need to be working on them but I literally cannot bring myself to do it.

ADHD,"o, I (15M) was diagnosed with ADHD when I was in the second grade, and I have been taking concerta ever since, becoming pretty good at masking it. In the 6th grade, I joined a new school, and became the laughing stock that year. I was bullied and shunned. The following year, a new kid, who we will call N, joined the school. N fast became the laughing stock after he did a bunch of dumb shit, and I started to rise in the social hierarchy.   However, N was diagnosed with ADHD last year and he is part of my friend group. However, I'm starting to get tired of being around him, because he does all this dumb shit, but then just blames it on his ADHD. This pisses me off for a number of reasons:  1. While I understand that his ADHD may make him do weird stuff like what happens to me when I don't take my meds, you must have some self restraint. I have ADHD, and I have self restraint. He also claims to take meds, but I don't understand why he still does stupid shit if he's on his meds I'm finally starting to go up in the social hierarchy at school, but he keeps holding me back. I want to go to parties and have fun in high school, but because he's always hanging around me like a fucking magnet, I don't get invited to anything.

ADHD,"o, I (F18) recently got diagnosed with ADHD-inattentive (although I believe that I am more ADHD-combined...). week, I started taking concerta 18mg but didnt feel any difference in attention, except for the very first day, which came with a number of symptoms too (health palpitations, nausea, shortness of breath). I upped the dosage to 36mg on the second and third week - still no noticeable change. I'm still getting distracted easily and have difficulty starting and completing my work.  quite some research online, I see that many individuals have titrated up their dosage until they feel that the side effects outweigh the benefits.  I do the same or stop at 36mg? I personally feel like 36mg is not enough as I dont see much a difference in my performance, plus I have no noticeable side effects. my psychiatrist told me today that my ADHD is mild and the meds are only here to give me a little boost for my upcoming examinations, so I should continue at 36mg. He also told me to stop taking the meds after my examinations for a drug holiday. I understand where he is coming from, but I'm afraid that the 36mg concerta will not benefit me as much as I would like it to since I feel little to no difference in my work performance.  should I do?

I signed up for the plan where you meet once per month with a prescriber and a care counselor (both 30 minute appointments).

As my prescriber is asking me to verify my information she realizes she and I reside in different states. he can't prescribe me medication or treat me in any way. he said I would be contacted soon by a ""care coordinator"" (whatever that is) to fix the issue.

They also left me a note claiming that I entered my address wrong. I verified my address in their system and yep! All good. They're not going to convince me I screwed up here even if I am emotionally vulnerable! I called and requested to cancel my service and to receive a refund since I never actually received any care.

But I’ve struggled all my life to do school and work and self-care, etc. I never had a “reason” for it, I feel like I’ve internalized all the judgmental, negative reactions I’ve gotten from others for my failures. I remember trying to tell my mom once that doing homework was harder for me than other kids; I can remember the “bullshit” face she made and that she told me I was too smart to think she would buy that excuse. relate to so many people here, and it’s pretty much the story of my life, but I still feel so judgmental and angry. Like, how dare you let yourself off the hook because you got diagnosed early when I’ve spent life bullying myself and trash-talking myself in order to force myself to get things done? It makes me so mad when people act entitled to be exempt from things I was always expected to do and still have to do. know everyone’s story is different and I try not to judge any individual. But I don’t know how to shake this general sense of anger around this diagnosis. I’m already close to disabled due to the other issues, and it’s just not acceptable to me to say “I can’t” because of ADHD. But it makes me so mad to see other people doing that.

I realize that this 'drive' is my hyperactivity and whilst it's been very beneficial to get things done it's also a major pain in the ass. make sure to set 'goals' for each day in both my personal and professional life. For example I might have a work project I need to get a certain % done or I'll plan to clean a room which makes me satisfied but some days I reward myself with a goal to just 'relax' and it feels like agony.  night was one of those nights. I finished dinner and cleaning at about 7:30 PM and just sat in front of my computer doing nothing until about 11 PM when I decided it was time for bed. I wanted to relax, do some writing, work on projects, draw, play video games, the list goes on... but I couldn't bring myself to do any of those because they were all conflicting with each other. Ultimately my goal was to just vibe and do whatever would help to relax my brain but the stress of deciding on something drove me up the wall and by 11 PM I just felt like I had wasted my night.  anybody have any coping mechanisms or tips on what to do when you've got nothing planned?

I am happy but for me, the wheel isn't getting reinvented, it's more than the wheel is finally spinning more consistently so I definitely not carlett Johansson in 'Lucy' or Bradley Cooper in 'Limitless'. I got diagnosed, I've had a monthly meeting with my psychiatrist and during my last one, it kind of hit me. I am getting more consistent. Whatever I have to do for school or work, I keep pushing myself to do my best, even to a degree of ridiculous but good attention to detail. very grateful for that, it's like I'm that pre-diagnosed me, that seldomly had these amazing moments of ~~hyper~~\-focus in which I gave my best. I loved that me and now I get to be that more often and that's amazing. I still can't fathom reading a book but to be honest, I haven't tried it yet. think another way to put it for me is that now I'm more about aiming to get very good grades and getting good ones instead of aiming to get mediocre grades and barely passing.I know I'm undergoing positive change after getting diagnosed but I can't always put the finger on what exactly is getting better",1635291537,1343,246

ADHD,"I was diagnosed with adhd as a kid, and my mom never got medication for it because she didnt beilive in giveing me drug. I ended up failing school later on and dropping out. my friend got a script for dexedrine XR and he knows i suffer from concentration, memory, etc issues. Im not self diagnosing, i know i need a diagnosis. Anyways, he gave me a couple dexidrine 15mg XR (yes i know this is illegal) to see if it would work for me. After taking it, i felt calm, like i can focus properly, talk without forgeting what im going to say. I dont really feel super jittery like i would off a few cups of coffee.  didnt take the full cap, i emptied out about half the beads and just licked them up since i was nervous going into it. Its a drug ive never taken, and im always trying to be safe with drugs. One thing ive learned over the years of drugging is, you can always take more, but you cant take less.  wanted to volumetric dose it for better accuracy, but i was reading the beads dont really dissolve in water well. I guess the first layer of the bead dissolves in 30min in the stomach, and each layer is delayed for a longer lasting effect. ince dex lasts 4 hours (instant release) the 15mg XR is the equivalent of a 12 hour sustained 5mg dose. (Quick maff). Going off topic. orry. question is, how did everyone here get a diagnosis? Again im not doing this because i want a crippling drug addiction, i feel it genuinely helped.  i read the rules, im not looking to learn what i should AY to the dr, more so, who I should go to for a PROPER diagnosis. hould i get a family doctor, or a psychiatrist?

I'm so angry that I didn't try harder, I'm so angry that I did this to myself, and worst of all I feel like I wasted my parents' money. I love the university I go to, and I don't want to have to transfer out, but at the rate I'm going I'll fail this one class, and it will set graduation back by at least one year. parents couldn't afford to send me here for four years, so I went to community college my first year. Assuming I'd graduate in a total of four years (1 CC + 3 Uni), my parents would've been able to afford it. But because of the way that the prerequisites are structured for my degree and how my credits transferred in from Community College, I was going to need 4 years (total) and two quarters of a fifth year in order to finish my degree. And then the pandemic hit and I was home for 1 and 1/4 school years, so my parents saved some money not having to pay for my room and board for that time. This ""happy"" accident (I use happy very loosely) made it barely possible for my parents to afford those two extra quarters. that's all been thrown out the window, all because I was a dumbass and didn't hand in some of my homework for one of my classes. I've now put myself in a situation where getting a 100% on the rest of all the homework assignments and 100% on the final is necessary for me to get a 60% (D) in the class, and the University doesn't count the course towards my major unless its a C- or greater. feel like I've wasted my parents' money, wasted my potential, wasted my time at school this quarter, and ruined my carefully laid plans for graduation.

I can’t even describe how hard i have to try to focus and hear the lyrics of a song. i will listen to a song over 100 times and have no idea what the lyrics are or what it’s about. it all just blends in. (what makes me think i’m not autistic is that there have been very FEW times that i have been able to focus and actually hear the lyrics, it happened the other day to a rap song and i was amazed at the fact that i can’t enjoy music to the full extent) of my life, my mind is literally empty. everyone says they feel their mind racing but i don’t even feel thoughts in my head 99% of the time, i wish i was lying. it feels as i have tunnel vision. i am not observant in any way and just feel as i am going through the motions of existing. i don’t remember directions in the towns that i grow up in and don’t even attempt to ask me the name of the street i drive on everyday for work. for example, i don’t look at things and think about them , think about things related to that, etc. i just see objects and keep walking. i drove on this street for 2 months before realizing i was driving past a fairly large pond… i have grown up drinking starbucks and seeing that logo but one day i ACTUALLY looked at it and was like huh that’s what the logo looks like. it’s stuff like that but for everything, all the time….the feeling is almost being dissociated if i could choose a word to describe it.  make a lot of random noises for no reason. my psychiatrist prompted the question as if i have tourrets, i know i don’t. i have full control of what comes out of my mouth and when or where i do these things. i will just be sitting in the house making random noises or saying things that don’t make sense constantly. girlfriend believes i do this because my brain is lacking stimulation.  lack of memory is scary. i’m deeply afraid that i will develop Alzheimer’s very early. i seriously don’t remember anything ever and it’s getting increasingly worse. when reading something i literally don’t process it. same goes for shows or movies, majority of the time i watch something i can’t even follow the plot or understand what’s going on. i simply don’t process what’s going on because i can’t focus on it.  sound verbally dyslexic (idk what you call this). this has only started happening in the past 3-4 years but it’s getting IGNIFICANTLY worse. i know how to spell decently well and i know how to write and i know how the words i am thinking of are supposed to sound but they come out sounding CREWED. it happens everyday almost constantly when talking to people. it gets worse when i am anxious but its severe and i know people think i’m illiterate. i believe the words are coming out of my mouth before i can stop to think about what i want to say but many times i sit and take the time to say a word and i still can’t get it out right even though I KNOW WHAT IT I.  articulate thoughts. cannot explain things for the life of me. even if i know the information, i’m incapable of forming logical thoughts properly and expressing them struggle immensely with understanding my feelings and emotions. i usually just shut down and feel empty , bottle it all up then break down out of no where every once in a while and cannot even explain why (not sure if this is adhd related)  sensitivity disorganized (one example is having 30-40 tabs open and don’t ever accomplish what i opened one of them for)  there are other symptoms but those are the main ones. does anyone have advice for me? i was on strattera (due to my doctor believing i only have depression) for 4 months and it did nothing for me. my doctor then switched me to wellbutrin which also did nothing. i am being re-evaluated for adhd tomorrow.I am begging for hope",1635287474,4431,846

ADHD,"Not to be alarmist, but I was perusing pubmed as one does, and I found something interesting:   psychostimulants are associated with long-term decreases in markers for monoaminergic neurons, suggesting neuronal loss and/or damage within the brain. This long-term ""toxicity"" results from formation of free radicals, particularly reactive oxygen species (RO) and reactive nitrogen species (RN), although the mechanism(s) of RO and RN formation are unclear. Mitochondria are a major source of RO and mitochondrial dysfunction has been linked to some neurodegenerative disorders. Amphetamines also inhibit mitochondrial function, although the mechanism involved in the inhibition is uncertain.

ADHD,"Rant/tory adhd causes me to do some things…wrong. Forgetting to text, talking over her, getting distracted all that lovely stuff. And I think I’ve gotten better and, well yeah i’ve just gotten better at a lot of these things. I’m not sure how I want this post to flow yet but I’ll see. I’m not one to blame everything I do wrong on ADHD, that’s dumb. I can put some effort in on helping myself. If I’m forgetting something often, I’ll write a reminder on my arm to do it. If I find myself doubting things my girlfriend says often, I will write in big letters don’t doubt. Because she’s told me that before, I guess I ask her to confirm things just so I can be sure a lot. he’s studying to be a trauma therapist. The big word to me is Therapist, and I have heard around and experienced some therapists or medical professionals who straight up just don’t think ADHD is a thing? I don’t think she’ll be like that but I guess it’s an irrational fear that she’ll tell me my illness is fake. Anyways, Here are the beans of the post.I had a meeting on campus today about engineering. What I can do to pass and all that jazz. I texted her this morning that I was going to that, and said that I’d text her when I got there. And I never texted her when I got there, I forgot. I saw an old friend that I really missed and a few other things. I had just gotten distracted. And she would normally have texted me asking if I got there safely, but she didn’t this time. o I just completely forgot about it. And she got really mad and didn’t tell me that she was going out today and she’s somewhere right now and I don’t know where. And I don’t like track her because I’m crazy but I just want to know where she is so that if something happens I can go to her. And she texted me saying to “have fun with your new girlfriend” since I was at my female friends apartment. And she’s not a threat to our relationship, I wouldn’t cheat on her. he trusts me but I just think she was mad that I never told her that I was going over there. But I think that traumatized me so I won’t be seeing that friend for a while. I don’t like thinking about that. I’m sorry friend. But she said I shouldn’t worry about it and that ”it will make us even” by her not telling me where she is. I guess I’ve been doing a lot to annoy her recently, well, doing a lot wrong. Things along the lines of forgetting to tell her when I get places. And I’ve been trying to get better at these things as quickly as I can. he’s been really annoyed, she’s lost her patience for me. I just wish she’d be happy for the things that I have already gotten better at. Why does it have to be a huge fight because of this one thing of not texting her. Ugh, I’m frustrated, I kind of feel like she should congratulate me and be proud of me without me telling her that I’ve been getting better. But that sounds selfish. Because i don’t know when i Really get better.Anyways I have to be this post. for any weird formatting I’m on mobileI’m trying to help my girlfriend understand ADHD better",1635284017,3028,593

ADHD,"I need to get assessed but I could use some advice on what I should mention/talk about to my psychologist. There is a 6 month wait period to get assessed so I could really use some advice to make life more manageable until then. I’m a 21 year old female studying graphic design in college right now by the way.igns in childhood:- I was separated to sit in the front of the class permanently with a few other kids because we had trouble paying attention- I had trouble paying attention as a kid so my mom got me a tutor. The tutor always got after me for constant fidgeting.- I was separated from the other kids during my standardized tests because I had trouble concentrating - I had trouble keeping up with assignments and would stuff them in my desk- I remember one time we had a list of assignments to complete that day and I was far behind. I got so frustrated I scribbled on the paper of the kid sitting next to me because he was far ahead of me.  now: - It takes me an outrageous amount of time to get school work done. I end up procrastinating, sitting there staring at my screen, or getting distracted for hours before I actually start. tarting projects feels like nails on a chalkboard. I end up spending 12+ hours on single assignments and staying up until 3 AM to finish. - Has to do with the last one but I have really bad time management and usually if there is a big thing I need to do I will set aside the entire day for it (and when I say the entire day, I will not shower, I will hardly eat, I will not make myself food, I will not leave my apartment/where ever I am doing said task, I will set the day aside solely on task. And it makes it really hard because it never feels like I’m living a balanced life.- I will get distracted with a fun project that’s not my homework or housework and will spend literal hours on it until that project is completed and then afterwords the guilt will settle in when I realize I’ve wasted the whole day doing something I wasn’t supposed to when I have a lot of other work to do.- I cannot work at home, I get too distracted. I go to coffee shops where I am there for a specific purpose and there’s a healthy slight distraction that actually helps me. I cannot get any projects done if I’m not also watching a tv show or YouTube video in the background. I need the extra stimulation to make things more bearable - I end up having trouble wrapping up last minute details, which leaves me with a ton of typos and little mistakes. I hate details. I end up always turning in things at work with typos.- executive dysfunction, there’s so much to do I dread it until I just end up not getting anything done. I feel paralyzed.- rejection sensitivity- overly sensitive when people criticize me. I feel like a complete failure.- I am have been super prone to daydreaming my whole life. It’s how I spend most of my free time. My entire potify is just songs that help me daydream. I daydream new characters into movies and tv shows I watch while I’m watching while I get bored.- I lose things so often it’s ridiculous, and then I get really frustrated and anxious when I lose anything. I lose my phone multiple times every single day- If I don’t immediately reply when I get a text, I will forget about it immediately and never respond- sitting through lectures in class is hell. I can never sit comfortably. I can’t stand just sitting and listening to my professor talk. In highschool I’d have a notebook where I would ‘doodle’ but it was mostly just me scribbling in patterns and writing random lists. Now I pretend like I’m taking notes in my laptop and just write stories or random lists of things I need to do, etc- I’m always fidgiting, shaking my leg, readjusting myself when I’m sitting. I have a really bad problem with picking at my fingers until they bleed, picking at my scalp until I actually create scabs, and picking at my acne. I am really ashamed of this part of myself but I can’t figure out how to stop.- Lack of impulse control. I don’t think things through sometimes. I impulsively online shop when I’m bored or sad and now I have a bunch of random little things I don’t necessarily need but I can’t bring myself to get rid of things- I am very forgetful. I’ll forget important details if I don’t write them down. I always forget names, numbers, and dates no matter how important. It’s like my brain just dissolves the info as soon as I hear it.- My friends always get mad at me because of selective hearing. I’ll zone out of the conversation for a few secconds and I don’t know what they’re talking about. Or if I’m not focusing specifically on them sometimes I literally will not hear them speaking directly at me.- This is probably an everybody thing but I litterally cannot function on a lack of sleep. I feel jittery all day. And it happens a lot because I stay up late often to finish homework. But coffee doesn’t really affect me.- I always forget to eat actual meals I have a hard time remembering when I have so much to do I’ll just snack on random stuff all day long.- I am extremely disorganized. I need to EE things for me to know they’re there. My desktop on my laptop looks so cluttered most people get overwhelmed when they look at it- My crippling fear of failure is the only reason I actually get work done but since homework is my priority I don’t actually really take care of myself or hang out with friends ever because I feel like If I do I won’t get my homework done.I’m having such a hard time I feel like a bad adult I just can’t seem to get my shit together I can’t manage my time at all everything takes so long to start and so long to do I never have time to do anything fun ever.

I was diagnosed as ADHD-C and checked off 9/9 for hyperactive symptoms and 7/9 for the inattentive.  typed up this huge document of symptoms I experienced. Took the diagnostic test. And was given a prescription that day. It honestly caused a lot of imposter syndrome. How could they be so sure?  remember talking to my doctor about it during a check up and his response was ""Look, just from these 15 minutes of talking to you, I have no doubt that you have ADHD.""  think something else that helped was how open and honest I'd been with my doctor. I told him I hated asking for an increase in dosage before my prescription was out. Would he think I was trying to sell them? I think it allowed him to see how serious I was taking things. He reassured me that it's okay, I'm trying to find my correct dosage.  guess I never realized how 'obvious' it was. I'd had people with ADHD literally ask me if I had it lmao!!

ADHD,"I have never understood why I was like this; everything makes sense now. I was in an emotionally abusive relationship about two years before diagnosis. My ex said to me, ""I don't understand why they made you a manager; you are so irresponsible. It's like you get home from work, and your mind switches off."" I have always been very good at my job. I work for Walmart. When I would go home, I noticed that I would become dysfunctional; I couldn't complete basic things and was very unorganized. After understanding my diagnosis, I understood why I was good at my job. I work in a very fast-paced environment. Work demands were constantly changing; I was my best during the hectic and crazy times that made most people cringe. I also worked in an environment that presented accountability and feedback. My job is exactly what I need to succeed with my struggles. The only struggles I have ever really noticed were when it came down to the slow times where you had time to focus on the details that are usually missed or go unnoticed.

Is there accountability? If you are struggling with your disability, please address your diagnosis with your employer. ADHD is a disability that is protected under the Americans with Disabilities Act. Once they have been informed of your diagnosis, they are presented with a requirement by law to provide you a reasonable accommodation unless they can show that it will cause an ""undue hardship."" If you are terminated or treated unfairly and feel that your employer violated Title VII of the Americans with Disabilities Act contact the EEOC (Equal Opportunity Commission). The EEOC is allowed to represent the employee. Depending on the court ruling, if the business is convicted of the violation, several possible outcomes exist. The EEOC can ask for several items, including back pay, benefits, and even reinstatement of employment; this is based on the court decision EEOC vs. Waffle House, Inc., 534 U.. 279 (2002). For those who aren't aware, this also includes businesses that contain arbitration agreements. The EEOC has been given the power to defend the employee in these circumstances based on the ruling of the previously stated court decision. The EEOC will trump any arbitration agreement between employer and employee. Do not let your employer take advantage of your disability. Note that I am not an attorney but am offering information that I learned in a business law class in college.  if you feel that you will need reasonable accommodations for those just now getting into the work scene, please inform your employer at your earliest convenience. This will help make everything smoother. For example, suppose you know that you will need to meet with your psychiatrist every four months and may need your schedule adjusted for the appointment. In that case, this is an example of reasonable accommodation.  make sure that you are taking care of your mental health.

ADHD,"I just want to preface this with I am going to get tested for ADHD when i’m back from college.  18 and honestly never even thought of ADHD and the possibility of having it until recently. I’ve researched symptoms and have tried to see how or if they’ve applied to me throughout the years.  afraid that this has led to a lot of confirmation bias.  are some things in my life i’ve correlated to possible ADHD and would like to see if anyone else has had similar experiences.  is a kind of hyperactivity. I often find myself shaking my leg really fast or some other movement when i’m trying to do school work. I even think in my head i’ve got to focus on not shaking my leg so i’ll stop and get this work done. Then 20 seconds later I find myself completely forgetting and still shaking my leg and not able to focus on something because of it. also find my mind racing a lot when doing a task that requires my full attention. For example when trying to study instead of thinking about what i’m doing or reading I’ll be thinking about something completely off topic like a future appointment, something else I have to do that day, etc. This also ties into I see myself often when sitting down to specifically do work I’ll get hyper focused on something completely irrelevant to the actual task at hand. This also makes me think do I not actually have ADHD am I just lazy?  find myself going back and forth on this since even when doing things I enjoy like video games I cant focus solely on the game. I either have a movie or show in the background to watch too and I just keep switching my focus back to one another.  are a few other things like general inability to focus but this all has me so confused if it’s just all in my head or if something is wrong.  anyone else had any similar experiences?Lost and confused.",1635279538,1815,342

I just moved to a new city to start school in pring and am supposed to be arranging all our things in the new place while my bf works.  I haven’t been able to get anything done at all, and every time I try it feels like there is a bomb ticking inside my body and like my limbs are all trying to fly off my body in different directions.  I end up feeling like my brain is solid rock and just laying in bed to calm down or even on the floor just breathing.

Like I'll put in some effort for the first day but after that I get bored and never really get any better at my hobby. You know how it is. I noticed that I started telling myself the hobbies I want to do are useless and not fun. That I don't enjoy doing them and I might as well do nothing instead, or just play videogames all day. These thoughts go hand in hand with a feeling of dread and powerlessness, so I know they're not healthy.

ADHD,"Hey, have been on Adderall for a little over a month now and was moved up to 10mg twice a day recently. My big question has to do with caffeine. My source of caffeine is Crystal Light packets for water which is about 60mg per packet.  I have been hooked on caffeine since I was a kid and now pretty much any drink I can force myself to drink has to have some caffeine in it. I found that both when I switched to Adderall and then when the dosage was upped my caffeine craving drops but then about a week later it comes back. For instance I have probably had 300mg of caffeine already today and will likely end up having more.  people talk about shakiness or increased stress when they are mixed but I don't seem to get this, if anything it seems to help focus me more. I will say sometimes I find that my arm feels strange or I am feeling warmer than usual which makes me realize I probably have had too much but never the normal issues. there people here that like me can mix the two with no jitteriness?

ADHD,"Hey, so my long term partner (27F) recently ended our engagement and I'm heartbroken. I can see that during lockdown (we are in the UK) I became dependent on her.

ADHD,"Hello all, I’m just looking for a bit of advice - this is my first post on Reddit. My (ex) boyfriend (34m) broke up with me recently and I am heartbroken. He was diagnosed with ADHD 2 years ago and is medicated but stopped going to therapy/ psychologist. I don’t have ADHD. When we met he hyper focused on me and made me the centre of his world and I’ve never felt anything like that before. I fell in love with him quickly and we spent every day together. His energy (while maybe too much for some) was actually what drew me to him.  relationship was mostly great but we definitely had some communication issues, I felt like I was walking on eggshells quite a bit with his emotions. For additional context he was also in the process of finalising his legal divorce proceedings (he had split from ex wife a year prior to us meeting) and I know that this was often overwhelming for him going to and from lawyers etc (no kids). I offered to give him space to sort out what he needed to do but he came back after 4 days saying he didn’t need space but he was just trying to keep me out of it.  made a real effort to educate myself on Adhd during our relationship. I read 4 books and listened to ted talks and podcasts to understand how his mind works and support him. I supported him with his daily routine and even exercised with him daily as I know that’s meant to be good. It wasn’t always easy but I tried my best.  fast forward about a year into our relationship he starts getting distant and ignoring me for days on end. I am then told by a friend that she has seen him on a dating app (the same one we met on) with a photo I took of him on our holiday. I was absolutely devastated. He grovelled and cried to me saying he was “an idiot for doing it” and was only swiping out of “boredom” how sorry he was and deleted it. I stupidly gave him another chance.  months later he goes off the grid again. I get really angry this time and go round to his apartment to ask what the hell is going on. He breaks down and says he can’t give me what I need and he needs to be alone to sort through his life etc. I was heartbroken but accepted his decision because I loved him and went straight into no contact. I then find out that he was spotted with another woman just a few weeks after we ended and he hasn’t spoken to me since.  I have no idea how much of this behaviour is adhd related or if he’s just a crappy person in general with no integrity or morals. I don’t want him back I know that I deserve so much better - I’m just hurt and confused by the whole experience and am trying my best to heal from it. for reading of you made it this far!ADHD partner broke up with me and I’m hurt and confused",1635277413,2696,532

ADHD,"Where do I even begin? years of doubt, both from myself and my parents, who called me lazy, irresponsible, and immature, I finally managed to get diagnosed with ADHD. I finally felt seen and recognized. Yay, right? not. off, getting to the point of being diagnosed was extremely difficult and I nearly gave up multiple times. I had to go through multiple psychologists and psychiatrists and was either only diagnosed with depression, anxiety, or [straight-up told I was just immature, and that ADHD might not even be real]( anyway, in spite of all that, in spite of my parents telling me to ""just do it"", in spite of the shame of repeating the same year of college for the second time, I [posted on my country's subreddit asking for advice]( and, even though I was met with a lot of ignorance, a few kind souls pointed me in the right direction and I was finally able to find an ADHD specialist, the only one in my country. only was he the only one in my country, he was also in the next town over, so I had to take a trip for nearly two hours each way in order to go to him, which was pretty pricey in and of itself, on top of the already expensive actual appointment. I also had to pay a lot to get additionally tested for ADHD by a psychologist that the specialist referred me to, so all of this stuff was very expensive for an unemployed student and my mom was not happy about having to pay for it in the slightest. first, I was prescribed Wellbutrin, an antidepressant that *can* have an effect on motivation, but it did nothing for me other than make my tics worse, to the point where I'd get headaches from them and still not be able to stop. After about a month on Wellbutrin, I was told to stop taking it cause it just wasn't helping me at all. I was prescribed Concerta, a stimulant, the only one available in my country. I was elated to finally have a chance to try something that might truly help me and felt optimistic having read about numerous good experiences with stimulants on here, I felt like it might also turn *my* life around. Now, the bad part is that stimulants are still treated as hard drugs here and are heavily regulated as a result, which makes them extremely hard to get and extremely hard to get a prescription for. I essentially have to go to the next town over monthly to get a new prescription for them because my psychiatrist has to write it once a month, both for my doctor to see and for the police to see so I don't get mistaken for a goddamn criminal substance abuser. top of that, my mom insisted that I get checked out by a cardiologist first since she read about Concerta's side effects and got spooked by the fact that it can make arrhythmia worse, and I very occasionally have a sped-up pulse, so actually getting an appointment for that also took a while and, by the time I was finally told that it's okay for me to start with the stimulant and I went out to go and buy it, my prescription had run out. I was told that it only lasts for 7 days and that I have to get a new one afterwards, which was something my psychiatrist had *never disclosed to me.* ended up messaging him about it, and he told me that he thought I'd immediately buy the medicine ""considering how badly I'd wanted to see my ADHD""??? But in the end, he agreed to mail me a new prescription as long as I cover the mailing expenses. I also can't get the stimulant for free like I could with a normal medicine because I don't have a valid diagnosis for it as ADHD is only officially recognized as a diagnosis if you're under 18 here and, from what I've heard, that's subject to change in 2023 at the earliest. this is where I'm at right now. I was so happy when I was finally diagnosed, but now I feel miserable. I feel like I'm being treated as if it's my own fault for having ADHD, when I never asked to be born with this, I never wanted this. I feel failed by the system, by my psychiatrist, by my parents, and by my country. I want to leave, but everything that leaving requires (graduating, getting a job, getting my own place, being more independent, etc.) is made harder by ADHD, and getting help for my ADHD is made harder by my country's rules.

I learned as a cis man to mask anything not considered “normal” real fast. I think my mom thinks if she can’t see something as mentally dilapidating then it doesn’t exist.

ADHD,"o I switched to Vyvanse and when it works it’s been fairly smooth sailing and natural feeling from there! But it's def not as smooth and *not* as long lasting as most people describe on here.   things first:    get spacey and maybe a little emotional on some days.** Constant lobotomy type of feeling, not robotic but just feel like I could stare at a wall. Then I focus more on that spacey feeling than the thing I need to do.   * This happens definitely with Adderall IR booster sometimes, which is why I skip that IR altogether more often than not.    * ometimes meds help control these well.      * Other times, my head hurts and it’s not feeling like it’s working.      * Then that’s when it does the opposite and either or both happens. a result, I feel weirder talking to people on it when this happens, work feels more stale/harder, can't access vocabulary or thoughts easily, less motivation/*weird head space* mentally and physically. FOOD OMETIME helps these and sometimes DOEN'T. I notice it working better with at least a protein shake.   * When I try to eat a little bit or a decent amount of breakfast food, sometimes I'll feel worse. But also, when I don't eat at all, of course I feel worse too.......      * ometimes I wonder how it would feel if I ate a very complete and meaty meal but I never eat breakfasts like that.      * But it feels bad to make myself. I do drink a bit of coffee but I've cut down a LOT because of Vyvanse/Adhd meds.        * omething tells me I should consume more electrolytes and that only helps sometimes. Otherwise it just seems like its random when these feelings all happen.   days it works great, still not as consistently as I’d like.

ADHD,"Hi people,   just watched this How to ADHD video where she showed an electric tea kettle that looks perfect for me. Does anyone know what kettle this is? [   kettle has a digital display where you can set temperature and is glass so you can see that you've filled it up, but they key part that I love is that when it starts heating your water it has red LEDs and then when it's done heating your water it turns green!

ADHD," Hi all, I'm looking for a bit of advice surrounding how I can approach this.   really not one for self diagnosis, however over the past year I've been coming to terms that I may have ADHD and my anxiety and depression may be a bi product of that and not standalone issues. I've been in and out of treatment for those for around 10+ years and no medication has seemed to helped, which leads me too now.  In the next week I'll be speaking to a therapist for the first time, and they're specialized within anxiety and depression which makes me very nervous to bring up anything surrounding ADHD. I've been shot down by family and friends when I've brought this up in the past, with them saying I couldn't possible have it due to me doing well in school and getting a masters degree, which has made me second guess myself insanely. I'm not in denial that I could possibly not have it, it's more so that I feel shut down as when I first heard someone speak about their experience with ADHD and how it went undiagnosed until it crippled them when they were late teen and young adult (My age), I broke down in tears because ive never related with something so much. I guess I'm mostly afraid of them shutting me down regardless if I may have ADHD or not.   would I be able to bring this up with my therapist?

I *do* drink plenty of fluids and eat during the day.

ADHD,"My mom unexpectedly dropped by the other day. We don't have a great relationship and I'm 100% sure she was snooping, but she claimed she was in the area and had to use the bathroom. Dumb excuse, but whatever. house was pretty cluttered. My husband (who is autistic) and I (ADHD) work two jobs from home and we're not great at keeping the house clean all the time. My younger brother also lives with us and surprise, also has ADHD. o together, we're terrible at routines and tend to block out the clutter until we have free time, which isn't often. We don't mind the chaos and we all feel like we understand one another, which really makes the home feel like a safe space for our weird ass brains. she skulked around the house and made snide remarks at how filthy it was (it was only cluttered, I do dishes and mop/vacuum daily since we have four dogs). It made me so upset. It was so rude. he doesn't believe my diagnosis and thinks ADHD is a trend or some shit. But it sucks that others can't recognize that the way my house looks now is PROGRE!!  we first bought our home two years ago, my depression and undiagnosed ADHD were ruining my life. There were never clean dishes, I probably didn't mop or vacuum for six months at a time, there was trash piled everywhere constantly, etc... My house may not look perfect, but I'm so fucking proud of the progress I've made and the effort it requires. It just sucks no one else can see it. I've tried explaining it to her before, but she just says I'm lazy. he has no concept of what mental disorders are or how difficult it is to clean or even shower sometimes. I think I have to give up on the hope that she will ever come around and be kind to me.  note, she's not allowed back at the house until she apologizes...which is something she doesn't know how to do lol.People don't see how much effort we put in",1635275982,1854,351

My stats were BP 117/94, 119 BPM. Again my psych said it was fine and I have the script to take the pharmacy tomorrow.  can't stop worrying about it, because it seems too high to me.

ADHD,"Tldr; I don’t identify with multiple tabs, bees in your head, object permanence or racing thoughts.  was diagnosed last year and while I 80% identify with most ADHD posts I see on here, there are some symptoms that everyone seems to experience and I never have. I see almost everyone say that they have multiple tabs open in their head. Maybe I’m misunderstanding it, but I don’t relate to that. I do have where it’s like “oh I should pick my clothes up off the floor” and instead start scrolling tiktok and then after a few minutes, I’m like “oh I need to go do my makeup” and never do the clothes, but it’s rarely like several thoughts in my head at once.  also don’t have racing thoughts. I do when I’m excited or talking to someone, but when I’m home alone and just relaxing, I typically don’t.  I don’t understand the thing I’ve seen about bees in your head. My head is fairly quiet except I’ve realized that without my medicine, I will ALWAY have a song in my head. But I don’t have multiple thoughts overlaying each other or excessive noise. I never have trouble going to sleep because of too many thoughts.  also don’t really identify with the object permanence. I will forget about something I don’t use a lot of it gets put away, but if it’s something I use all the time, I don’t just forget it’s in my drawer.  do have a family history, with my aunt, cousin and brother having it. I think I’ve always doubted my diagnosis (even though I went seeking an ADHD diagnosis) because the psychologist kept comparing my symptoms to her daughter’s and and was reading word for word from a book and told me ADHD doesn’t cause emotional dysregulation. he just didn’t seem like she was really evaluating me. I did take the connors 3 test and it said moderate chance. ex said “oh yeah, you 100% have ADHD” when I told him I got diagnosed though Lol.I don’t identify with some of the common ADHD issues?",1635275706,1900,349

ADHD,"I need an objective opinion on my situation. I just started seeing a psychiatrist a few months ago because I wanted a proper diagnosis of ADHD before I ruin my life even more. On our first 1 hour long VIRTUAL meeting, I spoke about my potential ADHD problems.  list a few: - Being distracted every 15 minutes during an important task. I would come back to the original task 1~3 hours later just to be distracted again in 15. - This leading to broken sleep cycle and inability to reach even my 50% during the day. - All of these leading to a slow destruction of my career. It really hurts to see the things I've built up slowly crumble.. But I still can't get myself to be like normal people. - Losing both mental &amp; vision focus during 1:1 &amp; group conversations.  the career one, all of the above are experiences I had since I was a kid. I was underperforming at most things except for the arts and very few other subjects that made me feel competitive.  here's the mistake: I wanted to be honest so I told the psychiatrist this: I have taken some Adderall from an ADHD diagnosed friend. I only got it at times when my situation went really wrong due to extreme procrastination. The frequency   of getting Adderall did increase over time... o I stopped taking my friend's medicine 6 months ago. No cravings, just the usual dysfunction and self-beating thoughts for being disconnected.  I should have gotten a proper diagnosis instead of taking my friend's medicine from the first place. But I didn't have health insurance until recently and was scared for the bill.  I disclosed this info, I could tell that my doctor is trying to steer away from the ADHD topic. Eventually, she diagnosed me with depression and anxiety. I do think I have a degree of depression and anxiety, but I can say it with confidence that these sprung up mainly as a  byproduct of my ADHD symptoms. At the end of the day, the doctor prescribed me with depression + anxiety medicines.  was actually pretty hopeful when I received this diagnosis. I was honestly glad to think that I didn't have ADHD. I had high hopes for these anti-depressants. BUT, my distraction is worse than ever now - to the point where I pull allnighters at least 3 times a week on average.  recently told my doctor about this problem but all I got was ""I won't diagnose you for ADHD until we see improvements in your mood."" This is acceptable, although I think my ADHD-like habit is the cause of my depressive thoughts. But then the doc said ""Even if you have ADHD, I won't prescribe you with ADHD medications because of your history with adderall."" I felt a bit insulted but that did not surpass this feeling of loss.  I might have misused adderall by using it without a diagnosis, a large portion of it has to do with lack of education and personalization of the dosage. I didn't have a doctor's guidance !! I strongly believe that a proper diagnosis and personalized ADHD medicine (doesn't even have to be adderall) can help my life.  please give me your thoughts. Is my doctor doing the right thing for me? Do I just sound like an addict? I'm genuinely curious.My psychiatrist refuses to diagnose me with ADHD because I have taken Adderall without prescription.

My new psychiatrist says it’s too early to judge whether it’s ADHD. My report cards and parental accounts don’t have any major red flags - my experiences don’t match their views of me because I still did well in school. was a little frustrating to hear considering my struggles with attention and focus among other symptoms I identify with, but I’m glad she “wants to keep an open mind whether it may have been overlooked or not, knows it’s an important concern of mine and we’ll revisit it after we rule out some other stuff”. going to be going down the diagnostic tiers to see what’s going on - starting by ruling out Bipolar II. he says some of my symptoms may be consistent with ADHD hyperfocus*or* hypomania and it’s important to get that right. Diagnosis and treatment plan still pending, but I think we’re off to a good start. I’m just glad I’m starting to get the care I need - whatever that is.  of my lack of diagnosis, the r/ADHD community has been a really supportive environment to learn more about myself and the condition I may (or may not) have, so thanks for that experience so far. - Just had my first ADHD assessment, which turned into a full psychiatric diagnostic work-up.

ADHD,"o, I know this might be a bit of an awkward question, but I went down this internet rabbithole on how ADHD and Autism have an effect on how we experience sex. I've found a lot of usefull info, but I also got a bit concerned when I read artikels in my native language (Dutch) and in English, stating how hard sex can be. It can hurt because you get overstimulated, or your mind may wander elsewhere, you might get bored more easily etc. do recognise myself in this, because the last thing mostly happend with my exes, I felt like I was just laying there.... Being cold. Waiting until he was done. Now it does make sense after I have read these artikels, since I do have ADD and Autism. have felt like the happiest girl on the planet for a while now, because I have found the most amazing boyfriend ever, and we have been dating for almost a year now. He's patient, always tries to meet my needs, isn't afraid to be honest, etcetc, I could go on for days about how amazing he is, but that's not the point of this post hahaha😂😂.  knows what he's doing in the bedroom, but he can't get me to orgasm. Everything he does feels amazing, but after a while we have to stop with the foreplay and just finish it because I feel bad for him that he's been trying for an hour, and just can't do it,  or because some places start to hurt ( I am scared I might be overstimulated tho) and I feel like I'm going to scream. ometimes I had to stop him and tell him to just finish it because I was scared to get cold and/or get bored. All of this makes me feel very sad and like I'm a bad girlfriend, eventhough it's not my fault. We just both want to have as much fun as the other person does.  problem is that I can't even to get myself to orgasm, because I'm laying there for 30+ minuts, my fingers start to hurt, I am getting cold and nothing when it comes to touch/emotions/thoughts feels good enough in that moment. After that, I just get dissapointed and don't try again. The thought of touching myself also just sounds very wierd in general. very frustrating to not be able to climax/have an orgasm because I know I am not able to relax, this was stated by the occupational therapist I had 6 months ago. After stating this they basiclly told me that they couldnt help me, because I do so much automaticlly and that I basiclly have to learn to live and accept my symptoms.

ADHD,"    TL;DR: How to inform your roommates with grace and kindness that they have kicked you out of the house for dopamine stuff.         Hi y'all, at 35  y/o I've been rocking (violently) and rolling (uncontrollably downhill) with undiagnosed ADHD for a minute. Recently got diagnosed and in conversation with my parents learned that I had actually been diagnosed as a kid, but was just told I had a 'learning disability'. ""This kid's bad at math, prob gonna kill it at life tho"", my working hypothesis of my parents reasoning behind not telling me. Last week I got diagnosed and this week I was asked to move out from the house (renting a room), due to things that I now understand are related to my ADHD.  Prior to diagnosis I just had to rely on people calling me on any brain-goofs I hadn't noticed so that I could adjust. Its a system that has worked to keep me on the margin's of society's good graces and happy company with roommates. The system however only works if folks talk to me about issues, if they don't, i'm often clueless, demerits accumulate and come to a head at some point. The homeowner of the house didn't have ""normal-brains only"" in the craigslist ad, but in conversation last night I learned that her expectations were as such. Having conversations/house meetings to discuss things wasn't something ""grown-ass men"" (her colorful choice of words) should need to have to maintain house harmony, and that I would need to move out at the end of November. If y'all want to get hot over some drama, and maybe get some ideas on how to talk to your roommates/friends/fam about a recent diagnosis, read on.        A note: I'm from TX and use 'folks' in conversation when most would use 'people'. In the closing sentences I use 'folx' as a callback to a preceding email wherein she used the term 'folx'. Not in my usual lexicon, but she really is a good person and I wanted to use her language to highlight the discrepancy between her words and her actions.           -----------------------------------------        I very recently was diagnosed with a neurological disorder that affects executive function and short term memory. o recently in fact that I haven't even had the follow up appointment to get meds. The diagnosis puts so many of the challenges I've had with seemingly basic life-stuff into context. Things like; cleaning the bathroom but forgetting the last step of taking the bag of trash out of the bathroom before skipping town, letting a hot skillet cool on the stove before returning to clean it and forgetting about it, or after returning home from the beach not thinking 'I was just at the beach, there's probably a bunch of sand on the bottom of these boots'. Unfortunately my life has been filled with situations like these. Open communication with friends/coworkers/housemates has allowed me to generally remain in folk's good graces and develop tools/approaches to adjust. Without an opportunity for me to adjust to specific situations, i've been doomed to repeat them, disappoint others and reinforce a personal narrative of laziness/inconsiderateness.         When I heard you describe my actions as evidence that I may not appreciate how hard you have worked to own and maintain your very nice house, and that my performance is short of what can be expected from 'a grown-ass man'. It broke my heart, because neither of which are true. Thankfully with my recent diagnosis I don't have to internalize those comments the way I would in the past as evidence of me being generally deficient and falling short of society's expectations. My point is that I didn't know I had a neurological disorder and wasn't able to let you know that I may miss things that seem so basic that they could be interpreted as disrespectful. There are many differently-brained folks in the world, a fair portion untreated and undiagnosed like myself. In short, your current definition of what can be expected from a grown-ass-person and roommate is not inclusive of the differently-brained, and I reject it. Keep that definition if you intend to sift out folx like me in the future, change it if you don't.Normal-Brains Only: Kicked out of house for having ADHD",1635272728,4177,708
ADHD,"I've been diagnosed with ADHD last year, to my immense relief, and i thought that it'd change my relationship with my mother for the better. I thought she was finally going to try and understand how ADHD affects people, and how difficult integrating in a ""normal"", productive life can be for us. But i was so wrong :( seems like she is always looking for ways to make me feel bad about myself (more than i already feel on the daily lol). Her latest trend is to mask her insults with motherly worry, claiming i'm not ambitious enough, i dont try hard enough, that everyone around me is out looking for a job and i'm still living at home depending on her for money. Her complaints are reasonable, i'm not denying that, it's a trial to deal w an ADHD child All i ask is for understanding that i do try!! i might not work as hard as the people around me, but i try the hardest i can, every single day, and apparantly it'll never be enough. he always says i never finish what i start, im lethargic, i dont take initiative (like my own personal motivational speaker). I know i cant reach the standards she wants for me bc of my illness, and I'm not asking for her to  provide for me forever, but I do think she overblowns my situation to make it seem as if i dont do anything all day. I'm a full-time student on my third year of college, writing my final thesis that needs to have at least seventy pages and all my grades are on the 75%-80% range. I'm doing the best that i can, and it sucks to have someone, the person meant to support me and love me for who i am, not even trying to see the amount of effort i put into things. My executive disfunction is off the charts and some days i don't see the point of getting out of bed, but i still try!!! i still deserve to be treated with respect, not for being the ""normal"" people standard of productive, but simply being!!! i cant even physically cry about it bc the damn meds fuck with my emotional responses!!!  really sorry about the long post/rant, and the scattered sentences. No one around me has adhd to identify w me. writing this down felt really good, like taking a weight out of my chest, at least :)My mom keeps saying she's worried about my ""lack of ambition""",1635272629,2214,422
ADHD,"For as long as I can remember I've always struggled with basic things like keeping myself organised, staying focused (especially on topics that don't interest me or feel tedious), and forgetting things ALL the time.  lived alone and away from my parents for about 3 years and it has become so much clearer that I struggle with basic things others don't. I've been falling behind on university work because I can't get out of bed due to having too many things I need to do going through my head and putting me in a loop of ""bit I need to do x first before I can do that"". I've lost my glasses that I need to see anything (I'm half blind and study 2D animation so no glasses means no drawing means no university work) and in order to find them I need to tidy which is already difficult enough to do with glasses because it's tedious and I can't organise for the life of me. also found that during conversations I'll frequently forget things like what I was going to say midway through saying it alongside basic words that any other time I can just say. Every time it's like they are on the very tip of my tongue I just don't know how to say what I want to say. That's not even touching my inability to talk about emotion things (which has put a barrier on how much I can talk about with my partner and it sucks) a lot that I'm missing in terms of symptoms mostly because as I'm sitting writing this, I've forgotten what they are.  have tried repeatedly to make schedules and plans but I always fall into the pitfall of not knowing what to prioritise and also just not being able to follow a schedule *I* have made. etting alarms and reminders on my phone haven't helped at all because I'll immediately forget after turning them off. were so much easier when I lived with my parents because my mum would pester me about things. Even showering and eating has become a struggle to do. not sure if any of this is actually ADHD and whenever I've talked to my mum about it, she's dismissed it and told me I've always been like that and that I was fine when I lived with her (which isn't quite true). I have tried to get an appointment with my GP before but there is only one hour within the day that I can call at for appointments at 9 o'clock in the morning and if I do remember to get up to phone, I'm always put on hold until its way too late to make an appointment.  short: I have no idea if ADHD is whats wrong with me and I don't know what to do apologies for any spelling errors.

ADHD,"My inattentive ADHD is bad to where it is hard to maintain an organized and clean house. Life in general makes it harder. I work a lot due to being a manager and being a single mom. I also do college online. Note, I was prescribed Adderall XR last month, but typically it has worn off by the time I get home for work; with that said something during my day is going to suffer. I can either take it to be able to focus at work or with life in general..... Houseguests/family is making everything so much harder. My babysitter was trying to save money to get her own place and move out but wasn't able to do so due to the amount she was being charged by her family. I let her move in with me to save money. he gets a disability check. My mom recently moved in due to some health issues. While I am at work, it's like no one does anything. I will come home to piles of laundry, dishes in the sink, dogs having peed everywhere. I have my own dog and my mom has one dog. I don't expect a whole lot, but is it so hard to put down puppy pads as requested. If everyone is going to sleep, I have requested that they put puppy pads in the kitchen and shut them in. Instead, I walk into a house that smells like ammonia because no one has let the dogs out to pee and haven't put down puppy pads. The dogs have free access to the house. omeone went into my bedroom and left the door open, so now I have to steam clean my carpet. I was recently diagnosed with inattentive ADHD; due to recently getting a more profound understanding of ADHD, I do believe my daughter has it as well. During hyperfocus, I can get my house cleaned and organized. Let's say I go to work the next day; I will come home and my daughter has unorganized everything. he will pull everything out and put nothing back; furthermore, she moves stuff from point a to point z. I will ask where something is at that I had found a location for and she can't tell me. he's still young, but it is so stressful to have someone literally undo all of the progress that you made to maintain a somewhat functionally organized house. My daughter is at an age of understanding; she attends school online. For more clarification, none of these people work; they are literally home all day with nothing to do. I don't expect anyone to wash my clothes or my daughters, but you can wash your own and dry them so I don't have to pull damp sour laundry out of the washer or dryer to wash again. I pay $650 per month for rent and water. My electric bill went up by about $100. The Internet went up about $40. I have to drive everyone everywhere because nobody has a vehicle. I don't expect help with bills necessarily, but at least help with basic cleaning. weep, mop, dishes. Let the dogs out to pee. And for God's sake, flush your toilet paper that is not what the trash can is for. When a trash bag is full, I don't need to see a recreation of Mount Everest.  for the long rant. Life is just very stressful right now. You would think having more people around would help with dealing with some of the downfalls of ADHD. It seems that every time I try to help people out, I feel like they take advantage of my kindness. If my daughter does have ADHD or even if she doesn't, I don't want her feeling like this is the norm to live in such a way.House Guests and A Child Who Possibly has ADHD",1635271656,3328,648
ADHD,"Hey yall, is a little bit of a rant, and a reach out of support and empathy not only for myself but hopefully for anyone else who may be struggling with these sub symptoms of adhd too and feel alone with it. I'm diagnosed with inattentive (diagnosed beginning of this year at aged 27). It's helped tremendously, helped me forgive myself for years and years of blindly assuming I was a bad human being that simply didn't function well. I've learned to understand myself far more, show patience and more love and acceptance and to compartmentalise the things I can actively change as they're just habitual, and accept the things that are more difficult to curb as they're simply adhd traits. time goes on (and as does the irony of knowing I've got two degrees in psychology and am only now decidingly looking inward at my own psychology) I'm able to slowly piece together what was learned behaviour from childhood and environment (which can ultimately be ""unlearned"") and what's part of adhd (that can be managed). I know my psychology, as is for all of us, is not made from one factor. It's a multitude, and I'm enjoying the rather painful and uncomfortable process of ironing these things out. apparently 27 years old is usually the age of self growth and discovery and my god does it feel like a painful tooth trying to shove its way through. One thing I've realised has always had a complete and utter grip on me since I was a child - but has grown worse this year - is sleep. And I'm pretty sure now it's caused from a combination of both childhood and environment, *and* adhd. a nutshell, grew up in a household of 8. Don't get me wrong, that was a lot for *all of us*. I think from a young age I loved being alone, I'd switch myself off and go scurry away somewhere quiet to day dream alone in a weird world. As a very little kid I loved drawing in my own silence, but sleeping pattern was good and always ofc reinforced by my parents. In fact it was really good, I remember having a reeeeally early bed time according to my peers in school. Into my teens, when shit hit the fan at home, that's where I found chaos brewing outward and inwardly and I found solace in nighttime. All structure had vanished anyway in the household. And I took grip of it and found peace in myself late at night, staying up listening to music and drawing, playing guitar, messing with makeup, reading. I felt at peace. would be falling asleep in class ofc forward now, I've recently finished my masters degree, and have always worked full time and yet I'm going to bed at 1 or 2am...sometimes 3am. Only to get up somehow and get to work by 9am. Forcing myself awake somehow. problem that grips me the very most with my brain and adhd is sleep. I realise that combination of adhd and environmental habits have been so engrained that even as an adult who is far away from the familial stressors and hurt, I still do it. like a mild form of self harm in many ways. Well, it *is* self harm. Actively and repeatedly doing something that knowingly causes you harm. cannot break the cycle. I realise as this term of self discovery brews, many of my symptoms have felt highlighted and more difficult to manage in my own brain. More notably I realise just how intense and analytical and busy and non stop my brain is. Constantly. Not one solid, or singular or chilled and neutral thought. It's constantly a buzzing of multifarious thoughts, worries, hopes, regrets, successes, failures, fears, phobias, shame. Always shame of it stops. I'm constantly walking around with a head bursting full of private shame and half the time I barely even can locate the exact cause of the shame. Just shamed for being. I'm always on edge that my thoughts have become colourized and visible to outsiders who are then annoyed or overwhelmed or confused by me. I always feel an overabundance of imposter syndrome and find it extremely difficult to relax around others as I feel I'm about to annoy them, to disrupt them to inconvenience them with my very presence so I pull away from everyone to avoid any of it, I miss out on like minded and caring, compassionate unique people for fear of my own shame, which leaves me with my own private boiling point of a head. I think I've answered my own question of why sleep remains such a significant battle in my life. I cannot and will not turn this awful head off. And perhaps the thought of going to bed and having minutes of consciousness is too frightening to me, to be completely alone with these thoughts because if my head is so chattery and loud when I'm preoccupied or busy then how bad would it be when I'm in silence in bed? think that's why I do it. Prolong the act of being silent with my own thoughts and wait until I'm exhausted so I can drop straight off. But each day I wake up exhausted too. It affects my ability to relax bc I feel I'm always risking being late for things, for work, for events. It's a cycle of shame. always assume and deeply feel my boyfriend is ashamed of me too. ees the worst in me the ugly the badDoesn't see me for the accomplished adult and woman I am, the one I forget that I am. I think he sees in me, what I normally see in me. I think if the one person I'm intimate with thinks it, everyone else will think it. need to fully accept myself, I need to embrace my busy head and find beauty in it and run with its energy instead of trying to shut it out. need to love myself and know that important people will love me too, will never find fault and bad, but embrace the good and lift me up. when all that's said and done... I need to sleep. set time, a healthy time. A good 8 hours all the time. I know my other adhd symptoms such as disorganisation and lack of concentration will ease up, if only I just heal my body with better sleep. just find it all too hard. I feel too alone in fixing this but more importantly, I think the biggest problem is I feel unworthy to. the biggest curse of adhd for me is sleep.

We love playing video games together, camping, hiking, watching hockey, and just talking for hours about anything and everything. He's hinted and mentioned a couple times that he has ADHD and he is on several medications (I don't know what ones specifically) and he sleeps with a weighted blanket. He definitely seems like he gets obsessive about things, for example: to build simple shelves he made several diagrams and researched for 2 days for best materials and designs. He also is part of a fantasy hockey league where he made like 5+ Excel spreadsheets for. Honestly I think it's adorable and charming how much thought and interest he has in these things.

I just can’t do it.  remember during the end of year in college a few years ago we had a bunch of essays and exams due in the very last week and I just couldn’t do them all and ended up almost failing even though I was getting A’s and B’s.  I’ve always been great with the content and learning part of school (I always do A work but lose a large percentage of marks due to late penalties) it’s just the due dates that get me.  need about 2 or 3 times as much time as other students and a wide breadth between evaluations.  I also wait until it’s too late to inform profs about this and without biting the bullet and registering that I have adhd they can’t help me.

ADHD,"Warning: rant like what the title says. I think i have adhd. Or not. I'm not exactly a doctor. brief background: I'm 20 years old. Currently in my second year college. I noticed this back in high school where i just can't concentrate on studying. I get easily distracted and i just can't focus during class. I thought it was just me being lazy. I could easily cram all the info taught a day before the exam. There are also times where when we were given assignments that i particularly liked, i obsess over it and could function the whole day without sleep.  my last year in high school, i started to notice that I sometimes couldn't concentrate during conversations. I had to apologize to my friends and asked them to repeat what they said again. It sucked but again, I thought i was just being inattentive. that I'm in college, I REALLY started to notice it. Maybe something is wrong about me, but I don't want to jump into conclusions. o i researched about it. The word that's always frequent was always ADD or ADHD. I thought to myself, 'Well that couldn't be right. There's no way I have adhd. That's dumb af.' that I'm in my second year now, i am now conscious that my mind dozes of every now and then and i get frustrated when I couldn't concentrate. I sometimes fall into that state where i have imaginary conversations with someone. Maladaptive daydreaming, or so what I've heard. Its goddamn FRUTRATING. I just couldn't concentrate! I've put locks and timers on my phone so that i don't use it every 5 minutes. Even without my phone, my mind goes into that daydream mode ffs. Wtf is wrong with me?!?!

My typical BP is usually around 110/70). heart burn / indigestion in chest that went away after a few days, likely intestinal constricting ""shrinkage"" in morning - vasoconstriction? pressure / dull pain in testicles bubbly urine in mornings mouth have been on and off dexedrine for years; I can only tolerate it for a few weeks to a month at a time now before I get overly anxious and stressed and then need to take a break. I tend to only take 10mg/day to avoid negative side effects. This on and off pattern messes with my mood, work performance and general quality of life. If I stop trattera I'm considering trying dexedrine with guanfacine - a combo I only tried briefly in the past, and didn't give it a fair chance.Neurotoxicity / physical risk of taking Strattera (atomoxetine) long term?",1635269953,1792,311
ADHD,"hi friends &lt;3 i’ve recently been put on Vyvanse (10mg to start) for my adhd and it’s been really helping! i was not specifically advised *not* to drink while on it, but i know a general rule of thumb is to avoid alcohol with any medication. i have a friend who is also on Vyvanse and she consumed a very limited amount of alcohol one day and had a pretty severe reaction, that resulted in a brief hospitalization. i’m not a huge drinker and usually only partake with friends every few months, but i am wondering: should i avoid alcohol at all costs now?? has anyone else on this medication had similar reactions? any advice is appreciated. cheers! 😉 lolVyvanse + Alcohol",1635269861,673,122

My doctor doesn't seem hung up on it either. And I fortunately live in a good healthcare system where, from a cost perspective, the distinction seems immaterial. I'm wondering: if it's unclear how much of your concentration issues are due to (primary) ADHD and depression or vice versa --- do doctors really *need* to figure the puzzle out?

ADHD,"o, I'm 46 years old and my therapist diagnosed me with inattentive ADHD. When I say diagnosed, I mean he asked me the same ten questions that are on the online tests and added them up. But I also don't think that he's wrong. When I was a kid, ADD wasn't something that was commonly talked about or diagnosed. Looking back I can't really think of many signs that I was ADHD. The one that stands out is the procrastination. chool assignments were always put off as long as I possibly could. The night before a big paper was due I would start working on it and I would stay up all night until it was finished. Other than that I don't remember much, my childhood was a long time ago.As an adult, I procrastinate, have horrible time management, I'm fidgety and my legs constantly bounce, if I'm by myself I basically keep moving and doing stuff until bed time. I can't remember the last time I've turned on the TV by myself. What concerns me is that I have trouble finishing movies the past few years and I can't even remember the last book I read. I used to be able to do both. I went from being able to watch a movie, to watching it over several days, to starting it and losing interest before I could finish it. With reading, I went from reading books, to reading books until I hit a boring section and never finishing it, and now I can't even get past a page or two. I feel like I'm reading the words but nothing sinks in. I'll realize my mind is wandering and go back to reread and it just keeps happening. I don't end up getting far and I end up with close to zero comprehension.Is this something that typically gets worse? One of the criteria I've seen for ADHD is that it was present in childhood. I really have no idea if it was. My ""diagnosis"" was only about a month ago, so this is all new to me, but I feel like it's explaining a lot of who I am and what I do.Can ADHD develop in adulthood or get worse as you age?",1635268156,1921,374

ADHD,"o I'm trying to pass 10th grade, for the 4th year! I only got diagnosed with ADHD at the beginning of summer, before that I only knew depression and anxiety to be the spit in my face. Now I understand myself a lot more, but also feel like I'm up against so much.  not dumb and I know ADHD doesn't make anyone dumb.1st month went alright. In subjects I excel at, like english, I've finished the whole semesters work in two weeks and the teacher gave me a more advanced workbook to go off. Fast forward to now, the 2nd month of school. I'm in a depressive episode with zero motivation or interest toward anything. Probably didn't help that my doctor tried switching my meds from Wellbutrin and Zoloft to Vortioxetine, that didn't work for me at all and switched me back to only Wellbutrin, and I'm still not back to my better self. Even things that have been fueled by my ADHD, like long hours of gaming, have come down to a few minutes of playing before it loses meaning to me. That means I haven't even opened my online schoolwork or shown up at all. I feel like I'm going crazy playing catch up. I don't even function like a normal human who could shower and brush teeth and not lay in bed and run an errand in the city and do a little bit of schoolwork in one day with no problem. ince my diagnosis is pretty late (I'm 19, F) and not that common here in Estonia, I think my psychiatrist is mainly focused on my depression and anxiety? My question is, how the hell can I break this damn cycle?! I feel so stuck, I just want to graduate high school, not keep restarting at the beginning.

Notes help when it comes to remembering the big things, to do lists are great at a macro level. But my little tiny issues compound and wreck havock on my self esteem. For instance I I keep a little side pouch on my belt at work for my pen and knife. I can't write reminders everywhere to remind myself to put my knife back in the pouch instead of on the table where I'll have to go looking for it for an hour, and putting little micro steps on a Todo list like that would just be absurd. I write big notes to remember to thoroughly go through the shipping list to make sure everything got picked and shipped but I can't write a reminder to read that reminder. Also when making sure I got the right serial number, reading the tiny print and making sure it lines up with the tiny print on a different sheet of paper and losing my place on the paper then forgetting where the serial number even is or what number I was even on.... When I do try and be mindful about this and practice mindfulness it turns into some meta analysis of my state of mind and ironically makes me perform even worse.

ADHD,"I've been titrating for 2 months and still haven't gotten a dose I am happy to settle with. first tried Xaggitin (UK), which I believe is Ritalin. worked decently gave me lots of energy and motivation but as we increased the dosages the anxiety was unbearable and so that didn't last more than a month.  am now currently taking Elvanse/Vyvanse, we went up to 60mg which I realised was way too strong and made it impossible for me to socialise and I was somewhat robotic. Extremely productive but it was really difficult to focus due to the intensity and like I said socialising was really challenging as I had very little going on in my brain. It felt almost empty?  since then I came back down to 30mg  and if I take it at 8am, it's honestly perfect until about midday, and that timeframe is pretty reliable give or take 15 minutes. During the time I feel it working I am so calm, clear minded and I yeah everything is just ideal, there's no euphoria anymore with it either it's pretty damn smooth.  problem is that when it wears off I am even less functional than before, I can get a little moody, the anxiety starts to creep pretty bad sometimes and I really can't focus or think well at all. I do have some boosters I can take but if I take them too early then by 6-7pm I'm full on crashing. It makes it pretty difficult for me to do daily tasks when I'm in between the medications 'working times',  I like to study at lunch and in the evening after work and I have to drive (new driver) at lunch/evenings occasionally too which is pretty difficult if I'm zoned out and just feeling tired/groggy.

Otherwise, a diagnosis isn't really necessary. one thing I've seen that seems to be able to tell the difference between diagnosis hunting and looking for help is how you ask.

ADHD,"I’m on “adderall” XR 25mg by Mallinckrodt. It’s a piddle of a dose for me, but I just got diagnosed. It’s also a really poor quality generic, but it’s better in some ways than Lannett. andoz 15mg was just as effective. alarm wakes me up and I regret playing video games until 11 last night I get out of bed and don’t eat breakfast, but I slam a Mtn Dew Zero ugar before getting ready for work (68mg caffeine). This is safe to do because it’s 2 hours before taking the medication. If I eat significant breakfast it ruins first half of the medication, it’s gotta be very small. A couple small candy bars are unobtrusive though and give me a quick dopamine hit. Nuts or granola would work better.  I drive to work 15-20 minutes late, damaging my hearing with loud music because I crave dopamine I’ve procrastinated for an hour at my desk and I drink a pill down with Vitamin Water. Vitamin Water açaí-blueberry-pomegranate (specifically that flavor) potentiates the medication. It does not work nearly as well with regular water if I did everything absolutely correctly it should start to work. If I ate too much breakfast it will take another hour to feel anything at all I’ve gone home by now and it’s wearing off. Within the next hour, the second half of the pill, the delayed release beads, starts to kick in. I drink another Dew and fix up my apartment a little the medication wears off completely between 9 and 10:30 and I begin to feel really uncomfortable and unable to fall asleep.

ADHD,I joined this subreddit maybe a month ago? It’s made me realize that a lot of the problems I have may be caused by my ADHD and I didn’t realize it. (I’m pretty oblivious to the obvious sometimes) it’s made me consider talking to my “anxiety doctor” about considering ADHD meds. I took them from ages 7-I think 14ish. I never saw a specialist for years and my meds were prescribed by my family doctor to which over the years I’ve begun realizing just how over prescribed I was. I was nearing 100mg as a 70-100lbs kid at 4-5feet. I felt like a zombie nearly everyday but when I forgot to take them I couldn’t control myself. In middle school I decided it’d be a good idea to try and join the military after I graduated which required me to drop my meds. (Military didn’t work out) over those years I worked on myself and believe I’ve come a long way but like my anxiety I feel like I have hit a wall. I was reluctant to even take anxiety meds but my life has changed for the better which is another reason I’ve been considering talking to my doctor about it. I just don’t know how to feel and you all seem like a supportive group and I wanted to see what you guys thought. orry for the rambling pretext.I’m not sure if I want to back in meds or not,1635261955,1246,242

ADHD," little back story, I started Ritalin my freshman year of high school after one of my middle school teachers talked to my mom about it. I went from barely passing 8th grade to lettering in academics in 9th. For reasons I can't remember, I stopped taking it half way through high school and was struggling again. when I started college I went on Concerta and just didn't have much luck with it. I quit taking it after about a year because I hated the way it felt. forward several years, I've been in my job for about 6 years and was doing fine until the pandemic hit and I started to work from home. Being on my own with out the constant accountability of an office environment really hit me hard. o much so that I received disciplinary action at work. It was bad enough that I thought I should start looking at this again. I got in with a new doctor (I didnt have one) and told her about my history. I was fortunate enough that I was able to get a prescription that same day.  started with 10mg of Methylphenidate and it was fantastic. I had things I'd been putting off for weeks (both work and home) that I was just knocking out one after another. A month later, however, everything went back to the way it was. I talked to my doctor about this as she had mentioned there are stronger doses. he increase my dosage to 20mg and it was the same thing. Great for a few weeks, then nothing.  May, I've gone from 10mg to 20mg to 27mg and am currently on 40mg. I feel like I'm spinning my wheels now. anyone had this issue with Methylphenidate? Did you have success with another drug?

ADHD,"I'll try to keep this short, but I wanted to share my experiences for anyone who's on a similar journey as me, and who can benefit from my experiences. most of us who are diagnosed in adult life (I'm currently in my mid-30s), I have a *loooong* history with my ADHD, dating back to obvious hallmarks when I was a child. I've suspected that I suffered from some form of attention disorder since I was a teenager, but due to a combination of: Growing up poor and not having access to proper medical care as a result,* Not wanting a medical diagnosis on my medical record affecting my insurance premiums *(this isn't as much of a concern in the UA anymore),** And being intimidated by the idea of taking amphetamines. never sought medical intervention. I had decent health insurance for the first time in my life in my mid-20s, I finally saw a doctor to get diagnosed. Due to expressing my aversion to taking amphetamines, that doctor recommended Nuvigil (armodafinil), which is most frequently used as an anti-narcoleptic. only ended up taking it occasionally because, for me personally, it wasn't *super* effective (although I recognize everyone's journey is different, and many people see tremendous benefits from Nuvigil).  spent years creating systems so that professional matters don't fall through the cracks, practicing mindfulness (meditation), etc. to manage my ADHD holistically, and I've grown a lot over the years because of it.  that growth, however, I still only felt *somewhat* *functional*, and very far from my ""full potential"".  three months ago, a friend staying with us who's also been diagnosed shared some of his experiences with Adderall XR.

However, there is always a baseline of not being able to remember things accurately, struggling to put together my thoughts, being unable to think straight, etc. Its effected every facet of my life.

Even if I do, talking about it, or applying it later is almost impossible. the hell do you guys manage this? It's created a huge deficit in my life, where some of the problems are: An inability to be articulate around complex subject matter. This has drastically effected my career, as I'm in a field that values people who can communicate their idea's adequately. Even trying to remember baseline terms is an issue. While working, it seems like it takes 2-3x more effort to get something done than others.2. I suck at debating/proving a point/arguing/whatever.  In my personal life this has created a rift with people because I'm unable to argue the subject matter. I try to develop my points around my understanding of the argument, but the wires always get crossed and I end up arguing something that isn't even relevent.3. In a heated argument, I struggle to get my point across, and even when I can, it seems that other people can just throw out arguments without problem. Before meds, I used to just 'shut down', where I stopped talking. Now I can make it through, but even so my arguments are lacking (at best). A huge issue I've noticed is when someone is making their points, and I'm trying to think of a counter, my mind is going through 1001 different arguments at once and I end up not being able to make a single one.4. The brain fog. Holy shit. ometimes I'm stuck in a zombie-like state if I'm not doing every possible thing to combat it. It's absolutely exhausting. I need to eat right, exercise, balance my life properly, have good relationships, wake up right, get a good sleep, etc. This is a full-time job just trying to manage myself to the point that I can actually perform AT a full-time job.

ADHD,"o I've been on trattera 80mg for two months now. When I was building up the dose, I felt ok, on 20mg I felt calmer, found it easier to study and just function in general. I also noticed my attention span and memory worked better since I no longer lost something every few minutes. I was really happy with the improvements though I hoped for a bigger difference. after 80mg, I've been increasingly irritable, overly anxious and restless to the point of completing things way ahead of schedule, but with the same amount of dread and anxiety as I used to complete my work last minute, pre-diagnosis. If not even worse.  stomach is super sensitive and now I'm nauseous a lot, my stomach hurts, my head hurts, I often feel faint, my muscles hurt, sciatica is back again due to my body tensing up, and it's just like my body hates me extra hard. And now every minor discomfort sends me into a breakdown and crying fits. Alprazolam doesn't help with anything but the physical symptoms of anxiety, I still have random urges to cry. I don't even understand why - I'm not particularly under pressure right now, nothing bad happened. example, today I've been getting random short crying bursts, then a few minutes of ""it's not even that bad why am I acting like this"", then again a few minutes of crying, rinse and repeat.

ADHD,"I was responding to someone's post and realized there are some silly/funny/stupid quirks of my mental condition I thought it would be fun to share. a preface, I wanted to say that I completely get that for some people ADHD is like a shackle mixed with a glass ceiling that keeps us from attaining our full potential or just holds us back from being able to interact normally. I get that. I don't mean to downplay your experiences. But it can also be a source of some good old fashioned self-deprecating humor. And I like to laugh at myself almost as much as I like to laugh at other, stupider people, so here goes... I physically cannot complete a video game anymore. Actually, I take that back but I feel like this is the exception that proves the rule: over the summer I finished Bioshock 3. I bought the game when it first came out and mostly I finished it because I picked up a save from like 7 years ago that was 80% of the way done. But while I love RPGs, for example, my modus operandi with those is to start a game with a cool character concept, play it for 10-15 hours, get a little bored, start a new game with a new character concept, rinse and repeat. Now I play a lot of roguelikes because I generally die before I get bored but even there there's a big process where I get a few hours into a game like that, get bored, and then do something really dumb and die and have to start over.* I've just accepted now that I have to set like 4 different alarms to remember to do important stuff. Pretty much the second someone says ""hey, let's do X"" I have to stop everyone to pull out my phone and mark the date/time because it is a certainty that I will forget if I don't.* I am soooooooooo terrible with names. There are people I've known for months and literally the only reason I remember their name now is that at at least one point I completely forgot their name and had an awkward moment saying ""hey dude"" or otherwise trying to have a conversation involving them without revealing I don't remember their damn first name.* I do improv comedy and I've just accepted that I am an agent of chaos. There are people who are really, really good at keeping up threads and keeping things from going off the rails. I just accept that those people exist and are necessary for me because I *will* completely destroy a set if you allow me to. I mean, don't get me wrong, I think what I do is pretty funny, but it is chaaoooooootic.* I can feel really, really shitty about something or some situation and then 15 minutes later completely forget about it.

Ive been taking concerta 27mg for about a year now, my insurance covered the brand name and my copay was only $50 for a 30 day supply which it wasn’t horrible, concerta worked AMAZING for me, however when I switched insurances they refilled it with a generic “methylphenidate ER” by Camber, it doesn’t do absolutely anything for me, I read online that I would have to request the authorized generic by patriot pharmaceutical, has anyone gone through this experience?

ADHD,"Time and attention is also fractured in watching frame-breaking split second scenes and rapid temporal shifts in plots. Reality doesn’t operate this way, but technology has allowed imagery to be manipulated. Images are broken up, shifting from one to the other, requiring our attention to keep up with all the constant changes, leading us to develop attention deficits (ADD, ADHD) and a need for attention grabbing visual stimulus.

ADHD,"I have a dilemma... let me just say that I'm in the process of finding a doctor for my primary care physician so I can get tested for ADHD professionally. (I finally qualified for decent health insurance, yay!) I'm struggling super hard with a couple things. Well, mainly just one: **coffee.** love coffee. I guess I'm kind of a ""coffee snob"" in some ways. Every week day I drink Death Wish coffee. I fill my travel thermos &amp; sip on it through the day, trying my damnedest not to chug it when I'm tired. The estimate on DW is 600-700mg caffeine in a 12oz cup. My thermos is roughly 20oz &amp; it usually takes me all day to finish... dilemma is this: do I actually exhibit signs of ADHD or is it just the caffeine I ingest? I used to get hyper off of something like Monster or Redbull in college, but I don't really feel hyper with coffee. I don't think I drink it fast enough to really affect things, but I'm not a nutritionist or a doctor. (I'm aware that most of us here are not. I'm not looking for a diagnoses, just support, I think.) I also still struggle on weekends when I don't drink DW coffee. No matter how much I drink I feel pretty tired most of the time. I definitely can have a cup of regular coffee &amp; go right to sleep no problem. anyone else struggled with coffee/caffeine &amp; ADHD like this?

Last year, I started experimenting with taking double and very rarely triple my regular dosage to get work done. Now, in my freshmen year of college, I've been swamped with work and naively saw Adderall as a risk-free solution to get myself to grind in the library. I kept upping the dosage, basically saying ""fuck it"", I need to do this work. The highest amount I took in a day was 120mg, IX times my prescribed dose.  realize now that if I keep it up my tolerance will screw me over when I can't always take that much and I would run out in time anyway. Now, it is even harder to focus without any Adderall and I'm afraid my normal dosage won't have the same effect it did before.

ADHD,"Like so many people with ADHD, I (31F) have no filter. I say what's on my mind without realizing it could be rude/hurtful to someone. I like to think I'm a good person though, and I'm always worried about people hating me because of my impulsive comments. I try to help myself feel better by saying they probably forgot about it, or they know my intentions aren't to be malicious. My friends will tell me if I said something that was hurtful to them, and I really love when they do so I have a chance to apologize and let them know I never meant to upset them. yesterday, I had a huge falling out with my IL (28F). It's been a long time in the making as I've always felt she had an issue with me. Back in July, I texted her and asked if everything was okay, and asked her to please let me know if I have said or done anything to upset her so I could make it right. I didn't get a response and what followed was 3 months of awkwardly avoiding each other.  finally convinced her to meet with me yesterday, and she unloaded four years of things I've said that hurt her feelings. Things like: when I designed her wedding invitations (I'm a professional graphic designer and did them free of charge and paid for them myself as their wedding gift), she ordered too many and I said ""oh that was a waste of money."" And at her bachelorette party (where I was the only one who didn't know anyone and was already feeling really anxious), we were trying to figure out sleeping arrangements and I told her I am a light sleeper so I would prefer to sleep on the couch because they wanted to put me with someone who snores. I didn't even say that out loud, I pulled her aside and told her. There weren't enough beds and somebody would have had to sleep on the couch either way.

ADHD,"Title. My whole life I've been a bit different. I had panic disorder until I was about 12, and while I suffered very few panic attacks after I started hight school, I still struggle with anxiety  and social anxiety (undiagnosed). not looking for confirmation here that I am ADHD, but I wonder if anyone can relate to what I'm about to share. my whole life I've been known to get lost in my own world. Teachers would often write in my reports that I was achieving. I remember I was always the kid looking out the window, day dreaming, and often the teacher would ask me a question or something, and I would have no idea how to respond or answer a (for example maths) question that I should have been (and was) capable of answering. imply because I didn't understand the context of the question because, well, I hadn't been listening. This caused me more than a few embarrassing moments. didn't mean that I was always inattentive though. If I was interested in something, I could focus very well. grades weren't bad. They were average, and at times better than average. For subjects I enjoyed I did pretty well. This theme continued from primary school (I live in the UK) through to high school and even throughout more recent parts of my life which I will get to. both primary and high school I lost multiple coats. Not a crazy amount, but a fair few. I never did homework unless I absolutely had to. For example in primary school, there were great stretches of time where I would see my peers handing in sheets of homework, but I myself could only stand at my desk and worry whether or not I might be in trouble. I think my issue was that I just procrastinated doing the homework- or straight up forgot about it- rather than a deliberate decision to not do it. was incredibly disorganised- still am in fact. In high school I was always late to class. Always. I would lay in bed in the morning with more than enough time to prepare, but I just couldn't bring myself to get a=out of bed and get ready until the very last minute, and then I would be rushing around the house and not have time to prepare properly. I would end up rushing out the door a mess. the end of high school, after getting my GCE's, I had a choice to make. Was I to attend my school's sixth form and study my A levels there, or was I to go off to a college and study them there. Well like most kids, I was leaning more towards the sixth form option, as I would be in a familiar environment. Well I put off filling out the application form for so long that I actually missed the deadline for sixth form, and therefor lost my choice entirely. I had to go to college instead. This was how disorganised I was. I spent week and weeks with anxiety eating away at me to get this stuff sorted, and I was aware of the deadline looming, but for some reason I didn't know the exact day even. I think when I realised I had missed the deadline, it was already like a week too late or something ridiculous. college, I started well, but within about 3 months I ended up buried in coursework that I was procrastinating. In one class, IT, I often ran into issues where I wouldn't quite understand what it was that I was supposed to be doing. I found the teacher's explanations and instructions confusing. I can't remember why, maybe I just wasn't quite listening properly? The funny thing though is that I am good with computers, and right now I'm actually with a startup as their front end developer. o I don't think it was a case of me not being competent, but rather struggling to be present and ""switched on"" maybe? was one occasion when I left one of my work books on the train. I realised when I got home, and so had to walk all the way back to the station and wait for the train to come back down the tracks (it terminated several stops further down the line luckily).  day I missed the my stop entirely and had to walk an hour to get to where I needed to go. Besides other things like things happening fairly frequently, my teachers would sometimes get frustrated or even mad at me. I walked into my photography class one day, and I think I must have been maybe 20 minutes late, and my teacher shouted at me in front of everyone for being late. eriously, what's up with that? I was polite and friendly, shy probably, and never caused trouble, but because I'm often late I get yelled at and embarrassed in front of my peers? In my graphic design class my teacher there yelled at me for forgetting my art book. It was humiliating. This happened with a geography teacher when I was in high school too, but whatever. point is, I've always been incredibly disorganised, and while there are multiple possible causes for my depression and anxiety (again, undiagnosed), I think my fear of failure is one big one. o back on top, I ended up dropping out of college in December. o I started in ep and by Dec of that year I had dropped out. I just wasn't coping. ended up attending university, despite not having any A levels, but I dropped out in my second year. I was ""trailing a fail"", which means I had failed a class in my first year which I would have to make up for in my second year, by taking an extra class. I had failed the class in my first year because I wasn't attending it at all. I had intended to do the coursework, but one day when I logged into my student account online I was shocked to see that the deadline for an important piece of work had already passed.  whole first year, and especially during the second, I was frequently plagued with this feeling of disorientation. I would lay in bed at night, anxious and stressing over whether there were deadlines looming that I wasn't aware of. I would feel so miserable and incompetent, and wished I could've just had my shit together like everyone else. had 4 jobs in. life since I left uni. The first 3 I quit after 3 months or less. The first 2 were retail, but again I was always late, or rather because I was afraid of not getting paid or getting pay deducted, I managed to get there JUT in time. I would clock in literally a minute before my shift was supposed to start. Being just a second late would mean you got 15 minutes (or 30? I can't remember) of pay deducted. third job was retail, and I remember one day I had to be told 3 times a single instruction- don't let the customers take the shoes to the tills themselves. o yeah this was a sports/sho shop. And I noticed my colleagues getting frustrated with me, but I was feeling so overwhelmed at the bright lights of the shop, and having to deal with the customers etc, and the anxiety of failure, that remembering all the details was too much. One time a customer was able to walk out the shop with a £50 pair of trainers because I managed to mess something up on the till. yeah I ended up quitting that job as well, simply because it was too stressful and I felt that everyone hated me there. latest job is as a front end developer/web designer for a startup. I started teaching myself coding about 6 months ago, and I think I have a knack for this stuff, but now I'm having to deal with real clients, and having to have a team of people relying on me to get shit done, to attend meetings etc... Well, I'm struggling. I'm really scared that this is going to be another case of me having to quit because I'll be overwhelmed. is wrong with me- am I just lazy? Or stupid? Well it's cost me happiness and success so far in my life., I ruined my education at numerous stages, from A levels to uni (where I was able to enter due to some really good fortune which is a bit of a long story). thing I've noticed; if I'm doing something like washing the dishes and emptying the bin, something mundane basically, I can have this wave of frustration and discomfort run through me. I suppose you could call it impatience maybe? Funny thing is I think most of the time I am quite patient, but maybe I just keep my impatience hidden well most of the time? Then again, a relative once told me that I did have a temper. I think I'm patient most of the time but can snap eventually, but this is more when I have interpersonal issues as opposed to. snapping over daily tasks. With daily tasks, I just get this horrible feeling like there's no point to the task and it's torture or something,. Like I HAVE to hurry up and finish the thing NOW, like I can't handle going through time doing whatever mundane activity it is. also have trouble getting to sleep. My mind feels like it's pulled in every direction as I lay there. ometimes I almost get a headache from my mind not calming down. really want to pursue getting evaluated for adult ADHD. If it isn't ADHD, at least I can cross it off as a possible cause. Again, maybe I'm just lazy? I've always been viewed as ""laid back"", and it's gotten to the point where I prefer to be viewed as laid back and chill, because really I'm super anxious and I try really hard and put a lot of pressure on myself to improve my life and step outside of my comfort zone, even to my own detriment. But I feel like I can only do things once the wind is blowing in my favour so to speak, and then I can ride that momentum. But I can't just switch on productivity, it has to come. This has meant that I struggle to perform in teams and when time is a valuable resource. It's like I can't fit into society or structure. anyone have any recommendations for going the private route in the UK?

And my therapist said that she thinks I will get diagnosed, if that counts for anything lols. my friends and I have this group chat, just the three of us. And all they ever do on it is complain about how they don’t want to do work and then an hour to a day later they talk about how much work they’ve done. Like… that’s brilliant, love that for you. put up with it for a year and a half, didn’t really mind, but it’s really starting to annoy me now, because it’s pretty much all they ever talk about. But then they say that, and then do loads of works anyways, so it’s like what even was the point in saying that. I can’t do work even when I really really want to so it just feels like a slap in the face every time they do it (which is almost every day). friend in particular, who I’ve always considered my best friend until very recently because she’s been pissing me off, is really starting to frustrate me. To give a little background, during our secondary school years, she’d be busting her ass and getting Bs while I’d barely try and get A*s. Obviously, A Levels are a shit ton harder than GCEs so I’ve been doing pretty shit for the past year and a half, while she’s been excelling. Now, I’m basically the class idiot and it’s pissing me off because I know I can do so much better but that’s slightly off-topic. my best friend claims that she doesn’t do any work but she does. Apparently, doing some exam questions and a practice paper is nothing?!?!!?!! Can you tell my frustration through my punctuation?!?! he gets As and A*s consistently, which is great, but she *does* work for it and her claiming that she doesn’t is, again, a big fat slap in the face because I’m ACTUALLY doing nothing and am getting Ds as a result. the other week, a friend of ours was saying how jealous she was of people that do no work and still get straight As, and this hoebag says “That’s true for ME, not for her haha”. Like?!?!?? Okay, that may not be true for me anymore but it was for 16 bloody years. That has NEVER been true for you. Which I did point out to her, which she laughed off and ignored. today, after having the absolute worst week of my life, on the verge of a nervous breakdown the entire time with this godforsaken booking process, during what was supposed to be the best week in two years as I was FINALLY going on holiday, I got an appointment for an assessment! I was so happy, I wanted to cry with joy! I texted my friends this news. Aired. Next message not being ‘Yay!’ Or ‘Let’s gooo’ but “The temptation of doing nothing all day”, completely irrelevant from my news. Woah. Never heard that one come out your phone before and then be contradicted a couple hours later. Best friend texts about this bloody cat she’s been cat sitting and of course that gets some laughs! I passive aggressively let them know that this was annoying me — “We’re not gonna get even a ‘yay’ for my life changing thing but we are gonna talk about the bloody cat? Gee thanks guys”. Laughed off. More about the cat. Let them know that I was not in fact being sarcastic. And got returned a gif of John bloody Mulaney saying “Have you ever been sitting there, thinking about something for like 20-25 minutes, and all of a sudden you’re like: “OH MY GOD, IM DRIVING!!!” “ with the caption “This is going to be you”. Which, okay fine is true but, still no congratulations or anything??? Thanks besties?? And apparently I’m not worth any more response than that. o thanks guys, thanks a lot.  feeling like absolute dogshit now and needed to vent it all off. Thanks for reading if you got this far loll. friends keep complaining about not wanting to do work and then a couple hours to a day later, they message about how much work they’ve done. Which feels super shit because I can’t do work even if I really want to. Best friend, who I was always much better academically in the past and is now excelling way past me at A Levels, keeps claiming she doesn’t do any work and is getting consistent As and A*s — which is absolute bullshit, because she does plenty of work. Told my friends I finally got an assessment booked after the worst week of my life, mental health wise, and was aired, laughed off, dismissed, and ignored. Feel like shit now 🥴Getting frustrated at friends complaining about how they don’t want to study and then continue to do it anyways",1635256503,4440,832

ADHD,"omehow I survived last year, by a thin thread too. I had packed all the assignments last minute and used my magic to come up with creative solutions under the pressure of time limitations.  this year.... There's zero structure, everything is self induced so you have to take your own initiative. They have lessons and such that just give you blank info and then you have to somehow just know what to do with it. They want us to apply for placements, volunteering, jobs prospects... All of it ties in, you basically do your own thing and record it all and they mark and access it.  I don't know if I'm depressed or just lazy either because for the first few weeks I've just been dragging my feet, my room is a literal dump and the other day I literally just ""decided"" to not show up for my lesson and literally lied in bed for the entire day. Now today I'm late for another lesson as I type this but I lost my student ID that gets me in and out of the building as well as give me access to a lot of things for students. I've dug through my room for half and hour and still can't find anything I'm at the brink of just crying at this point. I also just threw a tantrum and ended up accidentally breaking one of the bracelets my mom gave me and now you know that feeling where bad things just keep stacking ontop of the other and you just feel hopeless?

ADHD,"Like most people here I have major trouble planning things and focusing on (unenjoyable) things for a prolonged period of time. eeing as I'm in university, this isn't ideal. My old friends have long since finished while I'm still here at the age of 25. I have a clear goal I'm like a freight train, but when some small bump in the road throws me off course I can stray off the track for weeks or even months before getting on it again. It makes me afraid, but for some reason I feel like I'm getting better at it. As if every time I get back on track I'm just a little bit more stable and can go a little bit further. few weeks ago I frantically studied for a good hour or two for a test the next day. Even though it was more than I'm usually capable of it wasn't nearly enough, and I took it as another defeat. Then, last unday, I decided to sit myself down and study for a few hours more despite the fact that the test is next Wednesday. This time it worked. I did the same thing yesterday, I'm doing the same thing today, and I'm going to do the same thing every day until the test. doesn't equal milestones. It's a gradual process that accumulates with every small thing you do towards that goal, and you never know how far you've come until you suddenly do something you haven't been capable of doing for years. Even when you fail, pick yourself back up and recognize that you'll never be back at square one and no effort is ever wasted.A positive realization",1635255539,1464,280

ADHD,"To preface, I’ve recently set an appointment with a psychiatrist to because I do believe there to be something wrong. I’m not trying to get a diagnosis from this post, just trying to see if I even have any reason to worry. I’m very scared of being brushed off as it’s very costly.  always felt as though my brain was wired differently from everyone around me. I was seriously overweight but lost 50 pounds hoping it would fix my brain chemistry but I feel the same. I started off diligently counting calories and exercising but after a couple months just stopped. My appetite declined and I’ve continued to lose weight just off that. struggle to hold conversations. When people talk to me I completely zone out, not always thinking about anything in particular. Just not focusing on what is being said to me. I worked in a call center job and this was a major issue. People would tell me their names, addresses, or just general issues and I’d have to constantly ask them to repeat themselves. Made for lots of angry people, rightfully so. memory is CRAP. My family tells me about something I’ve said or done or experiences we’ve shared together and I honestly don’t remember them very often. When forget to write down dates and times for appointments and have to call back to verify when the appointment is. kills me. I’ve had to drop out of school twice because I can’t focus on the lectures or readings and my performance obviously suffered. Assignments are almost impossible to complete as I get too distracted to ever finish them. I start each semester off so excited and motivated but it always dies down in the first few weeks.  misplace everything! My phone, keys, wallet, paperwork, hairbrush, you name it. I ask my boyfriend at least 10 times a day if he’s seen my phone and anytime I need my keys if he’s seen them. jittery and fidgety. ometimes I sleep incredibly late because all I can do is think. When I discover a new tv show or cool game I become obsessed. Recently I’ve also had trouble focusing on tv shows? Like every few minutes I have to rewind because I’m sure I missed something important and I just HAVE to see what I missed. to the store or the mall or the dog park gives me serious anxiety. My house is a mess and I haven’t folded laundry in months. It’s in a big pile on my dresser. I forget to do basic things like brush my teeth or hair, shower, take my vitamins. I get so angry over minor inconveniences. taken several online assessments but they all feel so general. Also lots and lots of research. I just wanted to hear from people who do have it to hopefully get some guidance. Or maybe anxiety or depression? My biggest fear in this world is that the psychiatrist tells me that nothing is wrong with me and I’m doomed to be this way forever.Hi everyone! I was hoping I could share some of my experiences and y’all could tell me if it sounds at all as if I could have ADHD.",1635254698,2906,534

I’m failing like 3 classes now, and I did horrible last year (so horrible, in fact, that my gpa went from a 4.0 to a 2.6) because I can’t commit to anything.

I had them done and went to my next visit where the doctor told me that I was also ordered to have an EKG. I was unaware this was a test she ordered, but said I'd schedule one as soon as I could. he told me since I didn't complete the EKG, she wouldn't be writing me anymore prescriptions until I have it done.

Long story short, video didn't get filmed correctly, it's ruined, I have to do it over. This ENRAGED me.

Deadline on Thursday. elf-isolating before surgery so can’t go anywhere. Any tips on how to not do that would be greatly appreciated. I’m a final year undergrad student, having gone back to studying through Open University.

He’s gotten physically ill on multiple occasions and been pretty close to a couple breakdowns.  know this, and at the same time I’ve had the talk with him every semester about how unavailable he is- that occasionally (every couple weeks would be fine for me) I’d like to spend a couple hours together without talking about school because that is all he will talk to me about. To me, it feels reasonable. To him it feels like I’m selfish. In my head I’m thinking “why is 2 hours every few weeks so much to ask?” But he sees it as a bigger problem.  other night I brought it up again after two months of no intimacy. It was fine until he failed a test and he texted me that he was depressed because of our conversation.

ADHD,"I've been wondering if i have ADHD and I'm going going get tested but one thing I'm stressing about is that the doctor might dismiss me because I never really struggled in school. I have an awful lot of other potential symptoms, but I did okay in high school and got a university degree. Does that make it far less likely my potential symptoms are actually ADHD, is it really true that people with ADHD will aosta always struggle academically?How accurate is it that people with ADHD are bad at academics?",1635243862,505,91

ADHD,"Without giving much detail, I was diagnosed late with ADHD (the fun of being AFAB) and four years later prescribed methylphenidate by my doctor. I don't really like this doctor for multiple reasons, but especially because she refuses to prescribe anything other than Ritalin, and completely denies the existence of non-stimulant medications. Anyway, I'm on 20mg as my normal dose (I re-dose with 10 mg two or three times a day since it's the short form), and still don't feel any significant reaction to it. At best it will turn a good day into a great one, but if I'm already struggling with executive function (aka the days when I need medications) I feel almost nothing. I don't think my dose is too high because I've tried lowering the dose (which didn't help), and even at 20 mg I don't feel any of the physical side effects (anxiety, high heart rate, problems sleeping). Is it possible that I just don't react to this kind of stimulant? If so, is it worth it to pay for a psychiatrist and new meds, or will I likely be non-responsive to those too? I'm a university student, so I need to know if coughing up the money for an actual psychiatrist is a good bet.  I don't respond to 20 mg of Ritalin (short-acting) and was wondering if anyone else has had the same problem, and what a possible solution is.Is it possible for Ritalin to not work?",1635242417,1347,244

Today i took it \*before\* breakfast, and then had breakfast like an hour later. But i had a panic attack while it was starting to work in (or in the time slot it should work in), and it was much heavier than usual and afterwards i had an extremely emotional response to a small pent up issue to the point i was almost crying. I never really cry, i rarely get that close to crying, and i rarely get upset over such a small issue. It was an issue that had slightly pent up, but it was very minor but now after 1 comment isuddenly got incredibly emotional, upset and anxious about it. Usually my anxiety doesnt make me emotional, at all. Usually it maybe makes me quiet, stuck in my head, and gives me chest pains at most.

ADHD,"I’ve been feeling lost trying to figure out if I’m on the right dose of my meds or not, partially because ADHD makes it hard to remember and keep track of how I’m feeling day to day and how that’s changed with different doses. o I thought it would be a good idea to try tracking my moods and symptoms, so I can get a more clear idea of what’s going on with me. I’ve been doing some research and I can’t for the life of me find a simple, free app that let’s me easily track PECIFIC moods. I don’t want to rate my daily mood on a binary scale of bad to good. I want to track if I’m feeling especially irritable, anxious, lethargic, weepy, etc. Bonus points if it could help me track my sleep quality and productivity, too.  I don’t want or need fancy analytics or suggestions or tacit judgments from an app, either.

ADHD,"Ok so I have the common problem that many other people with adhd have which is the obsession with a crush. I think I am a little bit more anxious than some others when talking to girls, but it shouldnt be as bad as it is now. When I get a crush, I constantly think of them and literally cannot stop my obsession. This has made it so that I cannot talk to them, I'm scared to even make eye contact with them, I'm scared to show any signs. They are always in a frienship group far out of my social reach and most of the time it takes very little to set me off. I remember I got my latest one when she giggled(very VERY casually) at a joke I made FOUR YEAR AGO(start of high school). Its definetly come and gone, especially during quarantine, but it always comes back. I tend to have longer hyperfixations than others on this sub, mainly because I tend to hyperfixate on huge things that take ages to fully understand and absorb, but this is ridiculous.I know I dont actually like her that much, its honestly just the idea of her, but it makes no difference. I see the problem others have that it goes away quickly when you are in a relationship, but I probably wont ever get to that phase, because I am terrified of her.

ADHD,"I live in Europe and recently spoke with a friend who is also a psychologist and he told me that he can't really grasp why Americans are so fast with the medication. In his view medication puts ADHD-ers in a box and although it suppresses their ""bad habits"" it also suppresses their exeptional potential if they have some. There is a newer view that ADHD is not a mental illness but an evolutionary way and if it isn't a mental illness it shouldn't be treated with medication (basically drugs) instead we should learn to live differently.  moment you get off of the medication the benefits wear off and you're basically the same as before if you didn't get proper tips on how to structure your life and he doesn't see the benefits of basically being drugged to function. thought I'd share this I like the evolutionary explanation.Different views on medication",1635240328,859,150

The few things i actually take action on and start, i never manage to stick with, i get bored or i just...loose myself and start binging on the internet and snacks and porn. I seem to always crave stimulation from things, caffeine, nicotine, even when its clearly affecting me negatively but i feel like i just need something.  only things that work for me consistently is exercise, it makes me feel good, or hiking and the like. I started wondering when i found myself always over scheduling but getting nothing done, procrastinating everything as much as i can, can't study for shit. Well sometimes i can do my university work and i get better at it if i force myself to try to focus for longer periods but its a drag.  also almost always tired, i have really low energy reserves or feel like i get overwhelmed easily, like from spending 5 hours in school. Usually i feel little pleasure in doing stuff that i know that i want to do, like study, learn to play music or things that takes a lot of goal orientation.  find myself making long reading lists because when optimism and energy strikes i want to learn everything and i borrow 5 books at the same time from the library without ever finishing one.  makes me fatigued and so does everything else it seems haha.  i can usually manage things that i really need to do, like if i take a university class and i have to attend and i have deadlines i'll usually do it.  just tired of feeling like i never act or follow through with any of my ideal life fantazies about stuff i'd like to do and be good at.

ADHD,"o 2 years ago I was diagnosed with ocd. ince then pretty much nothing has helped my symptoms. My main symptom is obsessive thinking/hyper fixating on intrusive thoughts. It consumes me, it's pretty much all I can think about all day. I can't help but feel like I have something else causing these issues that isn't being treated. I've been reading up on ADHD and it seems it can have similar symptoms to ocd at times and there is a high comorbidity rate between ocd and other mental health issues. I'm in the middle of a bad spiral right now. I can't stop obsessing about something that my friends and family say is crazy  to worry about because there's no way a person without ocd (or something else) would even come up with this worry. I can't keep going on like this so I'm strongly considering checking myself back into the hospital and asking if it's possible I have adhd or something else. But I figured I'd ask you guys first. Does obsessive thinking/rumination/hyper fixating sound like ADHD symptoms? I realize no one here can diagnose anything so I'm just hoping for opinions on whether it's worth checking back in the hospital. Or should I go to a different hospital? Thanks in advance!Should I go back for a second opinion?",1635233087,1235,220
ADHD,"I was diagnosed with Aspergers and ADHD when I was 8. As I grew older, I would sleep heavier and heavier on days I didn’t have to wake up. chool days, parents would literally dump water on my face or hold my nose because sound wouldn’t wake me. On other days I would wake up around 2pm after going to bed at 10pm. forward to today, I’m 31 years old now. I am deathly afraid of every running out of Adderall because if I don’t take my medicine every day, I can’t stay awake and functional for more than 4-5 hours. When I was 30, I ran out of medication for 4 days and the doctor wouldn’t help me out. 4 days went like this:leep for 18 hours, wake up and eat, use bathroom, and fall asleep 2 hours later. leep another 16 hours…repeat cycle. only saving grace is that my poor wife was able to take care of my kids, 2 and 5 at the time while I was completely unconscious. I feel so much guilt and sadness that I can’t be relied on and that I might not wake up one day to a true disaster such as someone breaking in. On my medication, it is still impossible for me to wake up to an alarm. I try every day to wake up at 7am but it’s always around 8:30 to 9am. wife has told me that I have had full conversations with her in the morning, she would leave the room, come back and I’m passed out.

ADHD,"o, I (F18) recently got diagnosed with ADHD-inattentive (although I believe that I am more ADHD-combined...). week, I started taking concerta 18mg but didnt feel any difference in attention, except for the very first day, which came with a number of symptoms too (health palpitations, nausea, shortness of breath). I upped the dosage to 36mg on the second and third week - still no noticeable change. I'm still getting distracted easily and have difficulty starting and completing my work.  quite some research online, I see that many individuals have titrated up their dosage until they feel that the side effects outweigh the benefits.  I do the same or stop at 36mg? I personally feel like 36mg is not enough as I dont see much a difference in my performance, plus I have no noticeable side effects. my psychiatrist told me today that my ADHD is mild and the meds are only here to give me a little boost for my upcoming examinations, so I should continue at 36mg. He also told me to stop taking the meds after my examinations for a drug holiday. I understand where he is coming from, but I'm afraid that the 36mg concerta will not benefit me as much as I would like it to since I feel little to no difference in my work performance.  should I do?

ADHD,"When it comes to those with ADHD, I was wondering if there is frustration because, even though many of us like to feel it makes us differently abled or just thinking differently, when looking at them as a group there will naturally be more inherent limitations. example, nowadays for NTs, it is often considered the norm or at least not uncommon to be able to work as a full time B.., M.. or PhD student while working another full time job or at least part time job and in some cases doing that while having a family.  And have passions in sports or the arts on top of that they embrace. If we were to take a sufficiently large group of NTs and a group of those with autism, for the ADHD group there would be drastically fewer who would be able to manage that.  Or would be able to manage, for example, getting a 3.5 higher gpa in college while at the same time working a separate full time or part time job.  Outliers among those with ADHD, certainly, and deserving of being celebrated.  o to be sure, this is not speaking in any absolutes. But far less proportionally if we're talking populations of those with ADHD vs those with NTs. do those with ADHD manage feeling adequate and even having a sense of pride in light of this?  Is it based on this being an example of a sort of hustle culture that they learn to get over?  Perhaps out of necessity, because judging their worth to society by ability to engage in hustle culture would, for the majority, not work out particularly well?Do you often find that balancing multiple priorities such as school and work together would be too difficult to manage and so feel inadequate relative to NTs who have capacity to balance them together?",1635228400,1688,309
ADHD,"I’m sure for some of us, this is a very relatable experience. If it is not, do not feel shy, I’d like to hear your opinions as well. wondering how you’d want someone to approach you if something you were doing was bothering them, specifically something rather ADHD. Like talking too much, clicking pens, making noise, tapping, leg bouncing. I’ve been diagnosed for a while, and because of that I was able to get some ok therapy that gave me some tools to deal with this myself. I’ve learned to switch between noises, make a “quieter” noise, or less obvious movement, and especially making rhythmic noise bothers people a lot less.  I do not know how I’d want someone to tell me something I was doing was bothering them, to the point that it’s causing this other person stress, and they want to approach me kindly, but don’t know how to get the point across.  got asked this question today and had no idea how to reply. The best I could think of was being told something as a joke, like, “gosh could you talk any louder over there?” In a sort of teasing way.  how would you want someone to tell you to pipe down if you were overwhelming them?How would you want to be told one of your traits is bothersome?",1635227900,1204,223

ADHD,"M/21 there, am an unmedicated ADHD brain have flat-out issues with relationships with girls I'll say that upfront. I witnessed a lot of shit as a child which scarred me relationship-wise. My parents had a poor relationship; a lot of fighting, swearing, job tension, physical intimidation (in relation to the particular job which does enforce violence), physical abuse, overall just trauma. I became very passive, my goal was to avoid at all cost repeating the behavior of my father. In a relationship sense, I would be considered a ""nice guy"". I also don't want to be narcissistic but I believe I am quite an attractive male. I'm physically fit, 5'11 which is arguably not that tall, regardless, I have a presence I am aware of. People comment on my looks a lot, in both plutonic and intimate ways. I try to not think about it and let it go to my head, but it is a societal norm that people of my stature are seen as attractive. It definitely helps with confidence although. of my looks, I find both girls and guys try to make advances. I honestly understand the discomfort girls experience being catcalled. I feel continually narcissistic saying this but I'm just being blatantly honest, I think it's important to my situation; along with my looks, I do perform quite well in bed. I don't leave girls unsatisfied, put it that way. Where I fall short is my personality. I attribute this to just my weird obsessions in life. I have so many hobbies. I have found my ways of just being successful through hyperfocus on the things I love. The new roommates I moved in with in eptember say to me ""how are you just perfect at everything""; they're also 4 girls. I honestly just give off this vibe to people. Combining this with my trauma to be just a virtuous person I have been just as successful. I feel that these positives almost push people away. mom is truly my idol. he defines her personality as a ""helper"". he has such an open view that people can truly change. he would tell me that people need to be present in who they are to recognize their behaviors. With my father, I just saw her go through so much. Their job is high stress/high intensity so I have come to accept a lot of my father's poor behavior. he always stood strong, but more than that when I was right she always stood with me even as a child. We were a team and I cannot thank her enough for that. My father cheated on my mom when I was in university, I took it upon myself to support my mother, I had to talk to her through manipulation she was experiencing which was just beyond horrific; my father targeted PTD trigging events in my mother's experiences. I still believe the trauma he induced in her from those moments, is the only reason she is still with him today. Her trauma became my trauma. I sucked myself into it, but I really saw no other option, she's my mother, and for all that she has done for me. hope you're following, to where I am now. I am disgusted by male aggression, especially towards females. It hurts me on the inside. I've had past relationships where people questioned why I was so passive, that I'm too nice, I've heard it all. This has just become who I am at this point. I find it weird because I really do feel abnormal because of it. It causes me so much stress because I struggle to find girls who actually enjoy this. I don't think I go overboard with it, my niceness typically just extends through patience and understanding. I don't go preaching my views, I simply try to just be happy at all times, without going overboard, there is a normal limit. Guys typically hate this positive mindset, I get along better with girls because of this. I don't think I give off homosexual vibes??? Most people say I give off ""fuck boy"" vibes based on looks. just it although I make great friends with girls. 80 percent of my friends that I consider close are girls. intimately girls lose interest in nice guys, it's a sad reality. Maybe I am going to the wrong girls. I 100 percent am too picky but I am stubborn in that way. that you understand my introspective personality, this brings me to my obsessive tendencies with girls I find attraction in. It takes both personality and looks for me. I met a girl last April we hung out a few times, but we both moved home and kind of stopped talking, based on honestly both life position and distance. he also has ADHD and is unmedicated. I honestly really liked that we could share that. It's nice to be understood, rather than questioned. I moved back she started to reengage with me. I've now been sleeping over and hooking up with her. he holds my hand while we sleep, she kisses me when I get there and kisses me when I leave. he tells me how much she enjoys my company because of my positivity. he says it's a really nice change from the norm. I have been sleeping with her more than in my own room. We go to the gym in the morning together. It is just a really healthy relationship in all its actual expression. Now I asked her kinda what we are doing, not directly. he has pulled back now slightly and I am just confused. has been such a repetition and story of my life kind of situation. I obsess about what either I am doing wrong, or about what I can do next, which is in part why I am writing this post. I am supposed to be writing a paper. I'm struggling to get creative inspiration in it. I've been distracted by this girl. I think by placing these thoughts in a written form I can just temporarily let them fester in the Reddit realm. it's sad to say but this is why I don't pursue girls often, I always get like this, and it's emotionally exhausting. really appreciate any advice that I could either A) apply to this girl I am talking with now, or B) to future relationships.Maybe My Obsessive Relationship Tendencies are Normal",1635224769,5783,1072

ADHD,"Hello!  saw the post about people self-diagnosing themselves. I feel compelled to let you know that I self diagnosed myself. I am in CBT and I do have a clinical assessment of showing symptoms of ADHD. But I am on the forever long waiting list to get tested. If it so happens that I do NOT have adhd. Then I am somehow a master at faking it for reasons I am yet to uncover.  thought I just ""worked well under pressure"" until the pandemic showed me there might be more to me and that I wasn't as unique as I thought I was. I started to do my research and finding out I wasn't ""unique"" has been VERY comforting.  Here are some symptoms I relate to and how I deal with them: The first thing I learned at CBT is not to trust your first thought. o if you find yourself thinking, ""I'm having a crappy day"". Don't just agree with your dumb self. Ask yourself, ""why am I having a crappy day?"". List them out if necessary. Most of the time, I realize it's an issue that I won't remember in a week and it helps me move on. TL;DR Always question your negative thoughts. You want to get better at recognizing the signs from the beginning before you spiral.  I find that I tend to think, ""I have to do it xyz way..."" for some reason. But I realize that, I don't have to do shit that I don't want to. I read a post yesterday that was basically saying there are no rules to this life. Do what works for you! It's cliché to say but most of the time, our body knows what it needs but capitalism be capitalizing. o I get not having time to slow down and take care of yourself 3. Compare any action you think you have ""failed"" to murder. Yes, I said murder. If nobody is dying then don't stress about it. ""Oh shit! I forgot to respond to that email"". Okay, cool. But who died??? Note: This does not apply to medical professionals in their workplace  This aligns with tip 1 but I tbh I call my brain a LIAR. I don't trust my first thought, I always ask myself ""Why?"". Why am I feeling this way? Why do I want to do this? Why does this person need to know this? Why am I saying this? And if I feel it's ""necessary"", I proceed. If not, I stop. I know we're already overthinkers but this is more of a quick gut check. If you catch yourself reaching for candy at the checkout aisle, just a quick ""Do I need this?"" and really listening to yourself. ometimes my answer is ""No I don't need it but I want it AND NOBODY I DYING IF I EAT THI"". I find that when I understand why I act the way thay I do, it is easier for me to forgive myself.  I am but a child of 26 years old.

ADHD,Im 15M. o I went to my local pediatrician to check if I have adhd... I feel like I have it coz I relate to a lot of the symptoms.1 minute in the doctor says that there is no way I have adhd because someone with adhd can't just come up and say that they have adhd coz they can't even speak properly and they would constantly be moving around. Maybe I don't have the hyperactivity part i said. I told him how I have a really hard time focusing on things I don't like such as studying but then I can focus really well on things like video games. He told me that that I just don't like studying then because people with adhd can't focus on anything including video games...He told me that anything you've read in some random places online is all false and that you can't trust Google. I get that that may be true to some extent but I doubt what he said earlier is true...

ADHD,"I first suspected I might have ADHD around June, failed my A exams spectacularly in July, and have been trying to get an assessment ever since. the GP route first and was driven round the bend by this bloody secretary, who was somehow never in when I would call in. Called in two weeks after I asked to be referred for an ADHD assessment and found out that the place I’d been referred to had not even logged it, because I was still 17 (but I would have been 18 by the time I would’ve gotten an appointment) and they only did Adult ADHD assessments.  got myself referred to Psych UK instead and gave up while filling in the referral forms because they didn’t have an availability until June 202, long after my mocks and far too close to my actual A Level exams. ADHD 360 and tried to get myself referred there, was told that they only took RTC from the Lincolnshire CCG, and then that they’d apparently been rejected from the RTC program altogether, suggesting that they’re probably not very good (my GP’s words, not mine). I gave up and begged my mum to go private and spent about two months trying to find a place that wasn’t out-of-this-world expensive… and gave up and asked Reddit instead. FINALLY, thanks to a kind stranger on Reddit, I found IAmPsychiatry, who seemed absolutely incredible. Took me three weeks to fill out all the forms and after stressing out of my mind for the past week (that unfortunately coincided with the week that I was on holiday ☹️), it came back that the earliest they had was… December 21st, two weeks after my mocks would’ve ended. Had a bit of a breakdown in the airport and then again on the plane, and then emailed back asking if they have any emergency appointments available. They replied that they had one for November 14th… and I took it! past week has been so horrible since I found out that my mocks were sooner than I thought they would be, I spent my entire holiday stressing out of my mind, had a mini nervous breakdown on the plane back home because of numerous things that had gone wrong on top of all that. But FINALLY, I’ve got an assessment booked, I’m back in my own bed, and I can relax now 😌 booking process has been an absolute shitshow, been an absolute nervous wreck this past week, but FINALLY managed to book an assessment, and I feel like I could cry with joy!I’ve finally booked an assessment!",1635221157,2356,433

ADHD,"An ADHD Experience.  tried to think of a fancy title but couldn’t sort through the haze of thoughts and feelings.  ADHD experience is a little fuzzy as it starts early. I was fortunate enough to be diagnosed young. Like grade 1 kind of young. My earliest memories of school were dotted with taking pills at the fountain and surprising my Grade 2 teacher with the ease that I can take my pills like that as she struggled taking her meds without a glass of water to drink from.  on the other hand adapted to it with ease and it just became part of my routine that I, mostly kept to. I still had issues with school and teachers and bullies, What I thought was a pretty normal childhood. Aside from the times, I was pulled from classes to talk to counsellors. At every school, I went to. I never fully understood why I was pulled out for these, but hey it was like a free period. I just had to talk, and do some different things than my normal classes. I even got rewards sometimes. Best one was a pizza hut lunch in the 5th grade. eriously, I still remember that. went on regularly for all of my childhood, all the new schools and places that I ended up I met new doctors that seemed friendly and helpful. honestly didn’t really fully understand what was going on. I understood I had ADD or ADHD which terrified me when I first heard about it. To child me acronyms aren’t given to good things. I remember first hearing what was wrong with me and being very depressed. I figured my life was over and I had no hope for a normal happy life. my mothers credit she quickly pointed out that in my favourite movie at the time Aladdin the voice actor for my favourite character The Genie. Had ADHD and lived a very successful life.  know Robin Williams has never officially stated he has ADHD But to child me that didn’t matter) gave me hope and a hero to look up to of which I did until I no longer could.  unbeknownst to me the last doctor I would see about ADHD as a child did not really care. They kept 14 yo me on the same medication as 8 yo me and I was never a small kid. I was too big for most playpens by the time I was seven or eight-ish? At 14 I was already taller than some adults in my life. (Would eventually grow to be the biggest person in my family and yes that is one of the few points of pride I hold onto in my life.) as I started skipping days of taking med and not really noticing much difference I eventually stopped taking my Ritalin entirely. I was about 14 when I did this and ignored my marks going from high 80’s to barely passing for the next 4ish years. It was that I was bored at school and it was the teacher's responsibility to get me interested right? Cause they all said I was smart, I just didn’t apply myself. never did homework cause it bored me, I lied about doing it which at the time I didn’t feel bad about but now as an adult, I am sorry I lied so much mom. I just… I got no reason I was a shit head and didn’t do what I should have done. Like listen to you, be honest, and take my pills. late teen me was having the time of my life right? Hardly, I was the lowest of my social circle still picked on and abused (sometimes physically) but they stuck up for me if someone else tried anything. That’s what friends are for right? Well, it was the best I could do at least. o I did my best to fit in despite the treatment. highschool I was in no place to be going to school so I joined the workforce and since then have gone through dozens of jobs. Mostly in ecurity and Trades work. Eventually, I got myself into trade school and found myself making high marks again. Even in math which I had to repeat 3 times in highschool. This proved to me that I didn’t need meds, I just needed to focus and care then I’d rock at school. the 20 years I’d ignored my issues I’d always brush them off as just regular things, Everyone forgets things sometimes. Everyone walks into a room and forgets what they were there for. Everyone can get a lot done if they focus and hurry. Everyone has some enjoyment of the unconventional, most just don’t admit it. Most people are creative to some degree right? Everyone’s insecure to a degree right? ocial anxiety happens to lots of people. Procrastination happens to everyone, I mean distractions are everywhere these days. I don’t mean to be rude and interrupt people. But others do it too. o yeah no worries. I’m not meeting someone special because I’m not trying. If I tried much like school It’d happen for sure. years of this. 20 years of lying and ignoring and not addressing issues. 20 years is a long time as most parents can attest (yes kids you too can move out on your own. I was out at 17 and look at how I turned out! But seriously parents if you can help your kids and keep them around that’s a huge blessing) every time I would start to go “Do I?” omething would come up to explain it as “normal” especially when I got into writing. I didn’t think if I had ADHD I would be able to focus long enough to write much. Let alone the hundreds of thousands of words I’ve written the past 5 years since I really picked up the hobby and decided to take the ideas that constantly popped through the fog seriously and put them down.  one thing ADHD does for me is I have really intense moments of “OMG this is such a great idea” Followed by days of. “This sucks, all my ideas suck what am I doing?” Only to hit the high again later. I did finish a novel that I liked enough to self publish it in 2020 on Oct 20th. This is a day that will live with me for as long as my mind allows. Not because of the excitement and great feelings that came with publishing. But the lack of it. It passed like a fart in the wind. It was just something I did and I needed to keep doing it (cause i’ve built a successful habit of writing and now if I don’t do it I feel guilty and anxious) was the first time I noticed ADHD Awareness Month and decided to follow a few people talking about their issues. Only to see myself in so so O many of the posts. But the one that hit the hardest was along the lines of “ADHD robs you of the feeling of success.” That hit, that hurt, that broke me. That was the moment I knew I wasn’t doing as well as I’d thought. These past 20 years I’d been lying to myself and convincing myself I was better that I really was. is where it gets… fun.  o the following month when I went for my yearly physical I asked my doctor. Well told him. “Hey, when I was a kid I had ADHD and I’m starting to realize I don’t have that under control nearly as well as I thought I did. What options do I have?”  GP told me its rare for adults to be put on ritalin. I was like, sure No problem. Do I get like life coaching? Or Therapy? Or what? I just want something to start tackling this issue. got signed up to meet a psychologist at the Alberta ADHD research Clinic. ure, no problem. They called to confirm the date, its a 3 month wait but I'm sure I can deal with that. days before my meeting. I get a call. “Hi due to an emergency we have to close down and move your appointment. ok. Till when? We have to close for at least 2 weeks, maybe longer. We’ll contact you when we are back. ok (I understand covid could be the issue. That's fine at first. and a half months later I walk into my GP’s office and almost have a panic attack as I lose my practiced train of thought just as the nurse goes “How can I help you.” I haven’t heard hide nor hair nor anything from the clinic. I’ve been trying to call for a few days and not had any luck. o here I am trying not to scream. “What do I do?” in their front lobby. Because its not their fault. were helpful and got me signed up to meet a psychiatrist at another clinic. Great. It’s only a month and a half wait this time. Oh thank god. to the meeting expecting something to be done or get some answers. NOPE. It was just an assessment meeting. But I hit 7 out of 9 on Inattentive and 3 out of 9 on Hyperactive. o I clearly have more than just “normal” issues. back 2 weeks later and this psychiatrist was trying to tell me people out grow their ADHD. A genetic disorder. Which was likely my case, but he wanted to check my thyroid and heart rate before going any further. Without explanation as to why and wouldn’t hear out my concern. get my blood work back and talk to my GP no issue whatsoever with my Thyroid. But I ask him for another referral as this dude seemed more about trying to convince me I don’t actually have a mental health problem. The assessment before proved that I did have to some degree. (What Kind of doctor looks at test results and goes. “Naaah” not one worth another minute of my time that's what)  GP was concerned about it and agreed I should get another assessment with a different doctor. In like 2 months. ure, yeah okay, whatever. At this point I’ve been waiting 9 months to get anything to even begin tackling this issue. Which is just par for the course for me. If I wasn’t getting beat down by life I’d be more nervous that it was preparing for something really big. Better me taking the many small L’s repeatedly right?  the meantime I did the heart tests and I came back fine. The pinnacle of normal the heart doc said. o yeah. Finally get to meet the new Psychiatrist. And this dude just seems to not care. He didn’t even care enough to close the door while we were meeting and opened up about anti covid restriction conspiracy B which coming from a doctor is a HUGE red flag imo. spoke for maybe fifteen minutes before he made me fill out paperwork. The same stuff I've filled out 3x before about ADHD. But fine, whatever. he boils it down to “Do you want meds.” Not he thinks I should or shouldn’t. JUst do I want it? Like isn’t that what you are supposed to decide. ure I can function in society as is, but not really well apparently. then he asks. “Would you tell a customer if they needed a new furnace” (for context I am a plumber by day hours) and I replied. “It depends, do they need it? Or not?” Because if someone doesn’t need a new furnace. I’m not going to lie to them about that. If its an older model I’d let them know they probably only have 4-5 more years so maybe save up for something down the road. he can’t get off this me diagnosing myself I guess? But I don’t want to go back to my GP and go “Can I get another another another option? Cause That’s more months waiting. medication I am put on I feel no change. In fact I’ve felt like I;ve been getting worse for a few years now and these meds aren’t even slowing that. Which hey, it happens what are the chances that the first medication will work wonders? up and get a meeting with the Psychiatrist and explain how I feel. “That’s impossible. If you have a headache and take tylenol it should do something right?” I guess? But it might also be that the headache is too much for that tylenol? Again with more paper work I might have talked with him for 5 minutes. He has an air of indifference if not annoyance over the fact that I am there. And I don’t know what it is, what have I done? What should I have done? Like this dude doesn’t seem to care. I feel like if I dropped dead in his office the reaction would be along the lines of “Oh well, nurse come get this please.” and back to his cup of coffee. I leave but book an appointment. (Cause I forgot to while leaving last time and it took me a month to actually remember to call as if to prove how badly the medication was working for me) I got a month's prescription and the earliest I could meet the psychiatrist is 7ish weeks away. you can call to get a temporary refill of your prescription with no problem” The front desk nurse said. okay I find these new meds to be helping me focus at work. I think ahead more and am quick on my toes and really seeing an improvement. It's not perfect but it's a noticeable improvement.  a week after my meds have run out I am back to struggling. Feeling sluggish and struggling to focus. Ending up in ADHD Paralysis more than before. And struggling EVERY DAY to try and get this temporary prescription filled. Calling repeatedly and being I dunno lied to? Just ignored? I dunno what. But like it feels like I’m just abandoned. Like I was given a taste of how things could be better and now I’ve been dropped into the pit again. And I have no one I can really turn to. I don’t have people close enough in my life that I can break down and cry over this with like I really want to because it's just so damn frustrating. I can only get upset and rant. Because that really seems like my only option.  writing this out has done little to calm me. I just feel more fired up and upset over the whole thing. I am JUT trying to get myself onto a stable situation and it seems like the only way I’ll get anyone that might care an ounce is if I threaten to end my life. Otherwise it feels like everyone will just go “Yeah okay whatever” to my issues. And I dunno if this is a me experience? Did I just draw the shit straw of apathy from the medical field? Or is this how it feels for everyone and I’m just now getting a taste of it? Is it because I’m a guy and people really don’t care about us?  sometimes wish I’d never realized my ADHD issue. Because I could continue floating through life not knowing how bad it was. Ignoring issues and letting it take the 13-21 years off my life expectancy it does on average. am starting to think what's the point of even trying to use the bicycle brakes on my ferrari brain. It’s so frustrating, and I feel so lost. I am now a few weeks away from my yearly physical with my GP and thankfully one step closer. Maybe? I don’t even know. I want someone who cares a little. omeone who I feel will listen. omeone who has an ounce of empathy because I don’t feel it from any of the psychiatrists I’ve gone to.  note. F this whole thing.

ADHD,"I've only recently stumbled upon videos and posts of people talking about adult ADHD symptoms, and it's very easy to think that a lot of them describe me. I get so easily paralysed in the face of having to do multiple important things, I can find it impossible to get out of bed in the mornings (partly for that first paralysing reason), I find it nearly impossible to clean my room, change my bedsheets, change my clothes etc., I really struggle to respond to texts/messages/emails in any reasonable time frame (usually at least 3-4 weeks?). at the same time, ADHD is about attention deficit. I'm not sure how good my attention is, I guess I don't tend to stick to hobbies too long, but I have an undergraduate degree, which I did well in. And I'm currently getting a masters degree, which I'm finding very stressful but by setting daily tasks I'm (so far) managing. People talk about childhood symptoms, and I had very noticeable verbal and physical tics as a child, which I've heard are a potential symptom, and I absolutely still have them as an adult, it's just manageable to the point where people tend not to notice it anymore. But I don't remember being excessively energetic or uncontrollable or unable to focus as a child, if anything I was incredibly shy and withdrawn, and generally did well at academics. absolutely can't sit still, im fidgeting and tensing my muscles constantly, but that could just be restlessness. I feel like im so on-the-edge with a bunch of potential symptoms and that I definitely don't have a bunch of other, very common symptoms, which makes me feel like my brain is just trying to find, in ADHD, an excuse for the shittier aspects of my personality.

ADHD,"Begrudgingly i rolled out of bed this morning, I had a dream that my ex gave me an ounce of 🍀, I woke up and for 5 minutes looked for this imaginary 🍀 finding nothing but a dirty sock in the back of my draw. I traipsed my way down the stairs too my mums room, where I woke her up and hooked her up to her dialysis machine. Looking at how strong my mum is makes me realise how futile other people can become. However, I tend to get fixated on how others act and where it leads them in life. An example I have of this is lil peep, I love his music but why does he get what I don’t, both death and respect, I blame my jealousy. 12 pm I fancy some boiled eggs and of course dippy soldiers (toast cut into 5 bits too dip in in case you don’t know) . I finish my meal and go to check on my mum, I give her, her meds which consist of many drugs alongside oxycodone, oxycodone is an opiate, AND I LOVE OPIATE. Everyday I look away and think about my family, what would they want? Why would they want it? Are they using you? Will you be better alone? I know that I’m a paranoid person but sometimes the thoughts become too much. Time slips forward as I stare into space and I leave to go meet my friends, I took magic mushrooms which made me nothing but anxious, I hate where my mind goes and hate the person I am. Watching the new Halloween I stay quiet and after that I start to drink.

ADHD,"Today was my one day off this week. I spent it doing laundry, chores, and made myself a nice steak dinner. I didn't have any trouble with motivation today, other than falling asleep for a few hours, which I needed anyway. I've been really thinking about where my motivation comes from, and I noticed a pattern I've been in for many years. When I have purpose in life, motivation to move forward cones far easier. When I had Covid recently a d wanted to die, I had no motivation to even maintain my lifestyle. Part of that was from being so sick I could hardly breath, but another part was that I'd lost sight of my purpose and goals on life. After recovering, I started really thinking about what I want to do with my life. I made some rough plans that make me really happy to think about. I still dream big, which is dangerous for me with ADHD, but I decided to just be ultra realistic with myself. That brutal honesty made me realize just how easily I can actually live my new dream. Thinking back reminds me that I've already proven I have the skills, knowledge, and strength to do this. When my dream life is so close and on my mind, it becomes very easy for me to spend an entire day working on stuff.  all I did today was get laundry done, cook, and hang a few hooks, but it's more than I usually do. I normally just sit around, depressed and overwhelmed, wishing life was easier. I haven't made much visible progress towards my new life, but I didn't slip further backwards either. Just some vital maintenance so life doesn't get too difficult.  really don't like just throwing my successes out there. It makes me feel arrogant and weird. I want to share so that hopefully other people can find something useful in it. I wish I'd had found this group many years ago and that people had shared what I'm sharing. Life would have been far more pleasant. The point of this story is to remind people how important it is to have purpose in life. Mine seems to be to travel the world, learn as much as I can, build stuff, teach others, and entertain people. I was always an entertained when I was younger. My meds used to take all the fun out of me. I got in less trouble on meds, but I no longer felt any joy. As soon as I turned 18 I took myself off the meds to learn to cope with who I really am. I'm almost 29 now. It's been a crazy journey. The world crushed my soul and I've struggled with the basics of life. I've only recently made any real progress. I'm starting to remember what used to being me pure joy and chase it once again. I miss being dumb and silly. I miss making people smile and laugh. I even miss being laughed at when I did dumb stuff. I used to be known as a cheerful and hilarious goofball. Now I suspect people see me as an angry weirdo who lives alone and hardly interacts with people.  find your purpose in life and see if it helps with the motivation. My meds stopped me from finding joy in life, so I went off them. I do not regret that. Turn off the distractions sometimes and just try to sit and think about things.

Or rather if they do, it probably is not as bad as they think it is, and most of their symptoms actually come from Thyroid problems...ymptoms that overlap and are the same for both conditions.

People with less severe ADHD or don't have ADHD at all won't benefit as much because the medicine is not meant for them, and on the other hand people with more severe ADHD won't benefit as much from weaker milligrams of Adderall, or Vyvanse either.So apparently if you have Thyroid problems it can actually cause you to get misdiagnosed with ADHD, ADD, Aspersers, or other mental disorders like Autism because symptoms overlap.",1635212801,757,132

At first it went well, I went to my family doctors office and the nurse there talked to me and gave me some paper work to fill out. I handed that stuff in a came back for a follow up appointment. Despite telling her several times that I struggle with school I have just found a million strategies to help me get through it. I even talked about the hell that was online school. This nurse tells me “I don’t really see you struggling in school (because I still get good grades) and don’t think I can diagnose you with ADHD.” Then tells me “I’m not an expert on ADHD but it’s possible that you don’t have ADHD it’s just your personality”. he also told me that it could just be anxiety and I should limit my screen time. Yeah like my overuse of my phone is cause of my problems. I’m just so pissed. I always felt like I was crazy because my brain just didn’t work like my peers.

ADHD,"If this isn’t allowed, please feel free to delete. fiancé (probably) has ADHD. He was diagnosed as a kid, his parents didn’t tell him, and now, as a 34-year old in a master’s program, we are trying to figure out how to get him diagnosed again.  has struggled with the school thing since I’ve known him. He’s now in year 2 of his Masters and is consistently 2-4 weeks behind on all his work. He frequently struggles to get started on a project, even as he’s stressing about it, only to finally do it and it only take 2-3 hours. I don’t particularly doubt that he has ADHD, I’ve been reading all the resources he links to me and have watched so many YouTube channels about it that they are almost dominating my YouTube feed. I’m really trying to be accommodating. I have to ask, when am I allowed to call him on his behavior? Am I ever? behind on school work. I get that. chool obviously should be the top priority, and I didn’t give him nearly any problems when he kept canceling lunch dates with me (I prolly got a bit snippy and moody time 8-10, I no longer even ask him on dates). Am I allowed to be pissed that he’s picked up another raid night each week (now 3) that he brags that he never, ever misses? major important things need done, I’m the one taking basically it all on by myself [ex.finding us a new apartment, paying all our bills on time, coordinating both our social obligations, etc.] while also working full time and then I get, idk, scolded?… when it’s not done the way he wants it done?  you, I have my own disability that I need catering to that I feel he just doesn’t really accommodate to near the level he expects me to accommodate his ADHD. I have TBI, there is quite a bit of overlap with ADHD, but instead of having, say, executive disfunction, I have chronic pain as I literally do not know what it’s like to not be in pain. My brain can get overstimulated easier than a normal brain, and it will both increase my pain and put me in brain fog for several days after overstimulation occurs. I have memory issues and several other things.  often feel like when he is having a bad ADHD day, I’m not allowed to say anything or expect anything from him, but if I’m havin a bad day (like pain levels at a 7, shooting myself in the head would hurt less levels) I’m still expected to cook us dinner (or at least have a plan for both of us to eat) to listen to him ramble about whatever has caught his attention, even though he’s being loud and causing me more pain, double check anything that needs to be done and basically just still take care of everything. I feel let down and left adrift, but if I try to bring it up, I’m “doing everything you shouldn’t do to someone with ADHD” saying all the “worst things you can tell a person with ADHD” and “why can’t you just be understanding” or “ I finally was thinking you understood”. The word “understanding” is starting to become triggering, it’s starting to sound a lot like “submissive” or “subservient” .  I do worry. Am I not being understanding enough?

He asks if it is okay if his assistant sits in and listens, I think it's weird but say ok.He lets me talk about where I've been and how things have changed since last we talked. I can tell he has held onto subtle bitterness for me in the way he starts talking but I mostly ignore it. He lets me plead my case that I have major attention issues and it's been effecting my work. I say my sister has it and I think that my parents have it too because they are so neurotically annoying in their own ADHD ways except they smoke now which makes them pretty stupid to be around. He tells me how Wellbutrin can help with ADHD and why didn't I stick with it. I say well that was 2 years ago, I didn't think I had ADHD then (I had a mental breakdown after a terrible breakup and needed something immediately). Didn't want to stay on it though because I thought at the time that it was screwing around with my head and I was smoking so that didn't help.  ask why can't I be prescribed something like my sister has if she is diagnosed with it? He starts this argument with me back and forth about how HE was asking ME why I didn't stay on Wellbutrin... i WA on it a long time ago he just wasn't my psychiatrist then, but it wasn't for me and just aggravated my symptoms more and made me apathetic.  basically shut the meeting down after a half an hour and said if I want to get help I need to be more consistent with my sessions. I said that's not a problem but you need to be convinced I have it, how can I make you believe? He said he already did the ADHD test with me unknowingly and said he thinks I have bipolar because I'm not in control emotionally, and mentioned I procrastinate a lot. Like dude that sounds a lot like ADHD but what do I know? Like the fact that my fiance's mother has bipolar, would she not be able to point that out to me? He's like she's not the doctor though, I am. like at this point what was the point of this? What did we accomplish? I tell you everything I've done soul searching these past few years and hand it to you on a silver platter and you use my past drug addiction and inconsistency with getting help by putting a preconceived notion in this and paint me into the corner you want? I'm not bipolar, and if you ever talked to my narcissitic dad when hes not putting a mask on you could see he's the exact same way as us.  the meeting cuts short and he justifies it that there's more people that need to be helped, its a pandemic even though he was an hour and a half late to my meeting. If i wanted more time then I should've stayed on longer, they get the most time. And I say well I guess my time is valuable somewhere other than this museum.  ya this is how I wanted the conversation to kinda play out if it happened in my head but it was more like me balling at the end with his secretary still there asking if next month would work? I called back and said nah, ill go find somebody less old. (At least i got that one in)My Psychiatrist who my dad and my sister (who happens to have ADHD) also see denies my theory that I have ADHD",1635209476,3784,745
ADHD,Idk how to explain it but I always have like 1 million things going through my mind at once. And lately idk if it’s because of school and I’m more stressed now. I feel like my mind is messy. I can’t focus on a single thought without the background noise of 5 other thoughts. And sometimes it helps to write it all down but I get distracted half way through and end up forgetting most of it. Idk what to do. Not being able to feel at peace gives me so much anxiety and makes all my responsibilities that much harder to do. Any advice?I can’t stop thinking,1635209263,554,108
ADHD,"Back 3 years ago I was diagnosed with “Unspecified Psychotic Disorder,” it’s pretty obvious now to me that I was not psychotic, however. God damn that doctor. I went on a long journey of jumping between RI’s and none of them seemed to help, that is until i gave up and completely stopped going to my psychiatrist and left U for a family trip to middle east,  an uncle of mine who’s a threapist referred me to a psychiatrist and after going to sessions, she diagnosed me with ADHD, much more sound to my symptoms, I personally believe i got perscriped 20mg ritalin daily and it has been the first time in my life that I can actually focus on shit. Now it’s been close to 2 months since I started new treatment.  have her written prescription- but due to sanctions and stuff apparently U pharmacies do not accept translations of prescriptions from here, so when i comeback soon i’ll need to go to the psychiatrist again to try and get ADHD medication  problem is, i had told my older psychiatrist about my drug problem in the past, no clue if it’s on record or not (stupid of me ik)  now, coming back in a few months, how likely are psychiatrists to accept to try either perspiring me Ritalin or something similar (even weaker) when i’m back, given that I can show them the dr’s prescription from here is a geniune story, i have no readon to lie here but i’m a really anxious person and i can’t handle the psychiatrist telling me i’m a “drug seeker” or lying, as i’m already working very hard on my addictive personality- i don’t need reinforcements. works for me, i have not abused it and i genuinely think i’ve always had adhd, though it has been blinded by my good grades in school when i was younger question now is this: should i try and get a prescription back in the us or try and either attain the medicine through other means, or perhaps even find a legal or semi legal alternative (shit ton of [semi] legal RC’s out there with similar effects)Prescription question",1635209127,1972,361

ADHD,"Does anyone else struggle with impulsively lashing out/ saying things they later regret, especially to loved ones?

ADHD,"Hi, I really need to vent or I think I will explode in the next 24 hrs. Well, actually I've been through WAYYY worse moments, but saying this has been over my mind recently, and I really needed to say it. Please just ignore eventual errors because I am not English, it's 2 am, and I'm desperately studying history for this school morning, and I am going mad.  to the point: a thing that is frustrating me so much, is that I started noticing how, most of the time, while speaking - but mostly during oral tests at school - my mind just resets every time I say a word. Like, I am speaking but I can't fucking make a phrase with a sense that I forget what I just said and so I don't know how to continue my argumentation. And this is extremely frustrating when I am trying to have a good oral test, because I end up stumbling over my words, lose focus - that I've never had in the first place -, and fuck up all the study I've done. (And my teacher (extremely strict)  - or the Italian school system in general - is not flexible about this, it's not like I'm gonna get a good grade if I show that I know things but can0t explain them. In addition to my frustration there's the fact that my school has high prestation standards, and I've, since 1st grade, always been thought the top of my classroom, and now with the pandemic and the start of high school my mental health has gone to shit (actually started around elementary school, got worse between 6th and 7th grade, went uphill in 8th grade or ""my golden era"", and gone to historically downhills in the last year and a half, I've started 9th grade this year btw). I discovered I might - highly possible - have ADHD, even if my mother (of course) doesn't believe me, because I've been always good at school, and I've never needed help from her. My sleeping schedule and study organization went to fuck themselves too. Looking back, I was able to manage my life better when I was younger. God, this makes it even worse. Like, I dunno if I've reached my ""gifted kid burnout whatever thing"" or I've been always a shit but I was just able to cover it up even from myself. o now I, not only have to keep up with the others exception, but mostly important with \_mine\_, which strangely are the ones I care and worry the most about.) don't really know what to add, and I just procrastinated another half an hour writing this, instead of studying. Jesus Christ. my life feels like a fucking run, I am constantly running to catch up to Life, but when I think I've reached it I discover It just became faster and distanced from me even more. It feels impossible to keep running forever, and it's extremely demanding to keep up with the rhythm. This run stared again this eptember, and I've been doing back flips to keep up with it. I am now scared that if I slow down even a little or a weekend I will irremediably stop running and lose Life out of my sight forever, which means ending up in another of my historical down hills (the last one, and worst one ever, was during Christmas holidays last year. \_God that was looow asf\_.) And, as you might think, yes, I don't want it to happen again, even if I know it will - it must - happen, I', just trying to delay its date. The problem is that I don't think this run will ever reach a end (of course not until I die) and sometimes I wonder whether and why I should even run in the first place, if this running is not gonna bring me anywhere. Or is it? Idfk, tbh. Or maybe I do know, I just don't want to acknowledge the fact that I \_know\_ and very well but still hates the response to that question.  can't Life and time and everyone just freeze for a little while I catch up with them? if you didn't understand what I meant, but for those who are still in school or remember their school years, has this ever happened to you? it's already 2.40 am, byeeeMy mind reset every time I speak ( + extreme but not so exterme? vent)",1635208753,3917,749
ADHD,"Unsure if this really counts as success/celebration, it's probably closer to sheer dumb luck, but here's a little story. I was in college, I was approached by other students on several occasions about ""exciting business opportunities"". ometimes this happened on an individual basis, and other times my RA would organize an event so that the whole floor could hear the pitch. Usually they were selling makeup, skincare, energy drinks, or leggings (you know the ones I'm talking about!) and they wanted to know if I'd be interested in buying their products or joining their team. They always made joining the [insert company name here] family sound very appealing, citing the benefits of ""working for yourself"" with ""flexible hours"" and the lavish prizes you could earn if you moved enough product or recruited enough people. of this sounded great to me. I was young and super trusting, and I always needed money. I remember one girl in particular dangled the possibility of a company car, and that REALLY got me excited. Our campus was out in the middle of nowhere, and I was pretty sick of bumming rides from friends just to go to Target. o after I heard their pitches, I always wrote down my name and email address for these ladies and told them I'd be happy to sign up! whenever they would reach out to me afterwards, I always forgot to respond lol. I'm sure y'all are familiar with this phenomenon. You get a text or an email, and you fully intend to reply, but you have to look something up before can write back, or you get distracted with something else, or The Vibes Are imply Incorrect, and before you know it, it's been a week and you still haven't sent a response. And then you feel too embarrassed, so you just leave it be and hope that they forget about it too. I still do this, I think I currently owe five different people texts/emails. But at the time, I wasn't very knowledgeable about ADHD, and I felt a lot of shame over this. I used to berate myself, saying ""You're never going to make any money or get anywhere in life because you're too lazy, forgetful, flakey, etc.""  to the present day, when I'm both better at managing my ADHD, AND I know how to recognize MLMs for the scams they are. After listening to a podcast episode about how shady and cult-like these companies can be, and how people usually end up losing tons of money while working for them, I was thinking about how I totally could have fallen for one of these schemes when I was more financially unstable because the promotional material makes the gig sound so great. And then I remembered... I DID fall for it, multiple times, and the only thing that saved me was my lack of executive function! There but for my terminal forgetfulness went I!  so glad I never remembered to reply to those emails. Having ADHD can be really difficult. For me, ADHD makes it harder to hold a job and maintain relationships. I've lost count of the number of times I have cried over my poor time management, inattentiveness, and difficulty with completing mundane tasks. But, if nothing else, I can be thankful that in a few particular instances, it helped save me from a lot of financial and emotional hardship! Just thought y'all might find it amusing. :)Upon reflection, I think my ADHD helped me avoid getting involved with multi-level marketing schemes (MLMs)",1635208550,3329,590

I'm a 26 y/o male 5'11 and I take 30mg Vyvanse daily with a coffee every morning at 8/9 am with breakfast before consuming. In the afternoon i feel myself coming down a little bit so I have either a coffee or a tea.

I am also an avid nicotine vaper which I use pretty much all day in my office in between appointments. By the end of my shift at 5/6pm, i feel irritable, annoyed, anxious, impatient and feel like I have a different personality compared to the morning. I pretty much turn into a narcissistic asshole with lack of empathy. No suicidal thoughts but sometimes i convince myself that im useless without this medication. Off the meds, i feel completely like myself but in a few days, my ADHD comes back.  I've been taking vyvanse for about 3-4 years on and off due to the side effects that I get. Note that this kind of day doesn't happen all the time, but more often than so. Wondering if any of you have experienced this type of change in yourselves and If i need to make changes on a daily basis to have a better experience on vyvanse because It does tremendously help me, but the come down is just fucking brutal.

ADHD,"I hate having adhd and being autistic. I feel so broken, so different from everyone else.  stigma around both conditions destroys people. My natural way of being has been pathologized since I was six years old. While I understand that medication is often necessary in the treatment of ADHD, the terms used to describe me were so toxic. The way my doctors and teachers talked about me was so hurtful. I constantly had to hear, “This is wrong with them, this is wrong them, now they are behaving in this negative way, now this is not normal about them.”  matter how much I tried to behave, no matter how hard I tried to please others, someone was always complaining about my behavior. omeone was always saying there was something wrong with me.

ADHD,"disclaimer: Hi everyone, before i dive into this, i just want to put it out there that i am not looking for a diagnosis. That is something that I completely understand must be handled professionally to get a solid answer, but I’m here mostly out of curiosity before I determine if getting “checked out” is 100% necessary for me. i also posted this in the OCD thread, so if you saw this already, please ignore! i feel like i show symptoms of both but am just curious who in here may relate before i take some steps to get actually diagnosed by a professional to find out for 100%.  I was talking to my boyfriend about little “quirks” we have or just weird things we do for no reason. Mine, for example, were that: I count everything. Absolutely everything. And there’s no reasoning for why I’m counting things, I just do. When I’m driving, especially, I count the “parts” of all the signs, buildings, cars that I see. And i group them into little categories that don’t really have any meaning.  I am a musician, so for my fellow musicians out there, I solfege just about everything I hear. And i won’t stop doing it in my head until I know it’s perfect. It just doesn’t feel right to move on until I know I’ve got it 100%.  I’ll fixate on things for hours at a time. Last year, I wanted to learn the piano. I ended up sitting at the piano for about 6 hours a day without realizing that it had been that long. I wasn’t forcing myself or anything, I just got hyper focused on it I think. And I do that in a lot of other activities as well.  Recently I noticed that I can’t focus too well unless I’m moving. Today for example, I was trying to study and I couldn’t concentrate for longer than a couple minutes. I then started rocking back and forth while sitting (this is all completely involuntary and didn’t notice i was doing this until later on), and ended up being glued to my notes for about 30 minutes.  I often worry about things that I know I have 100% done. To elaborate a bit on this, one thing I do all the time is that I worry that I didn’t turn off my hair straightener even though I remember for a fact that I did. This happens CONTANTLY and i remember doing things like this since I was kid. When I was younger, I would watch my brother like a hawk because I was scared that something would happen and it would be my fault if it did.  I have this “skin picking” type thing. I’m not entirely sure how to describe it, but whenever Im anxious or nervous, I pick at the skin right under my fingernails. And I play with my earrings or earlobe. It drives me crazy because I can’t stop doing it.  anybody else have things that they do that are similar? I’m curious if this has anything to do with OCD or ADHD.

Instead, I just need to listen to Alan Watts!!!!! Thanks (redacted), my ADHD is cured!!! and then she proceeded to argue with my about how adhd isn’t real, and then tried to play me a video on her phone (which I hate when people do that)  of Alan watts, oh my god…………….Who needs medication when u can meditate??? 🙄🙄🙄🙄",1635205292,568,103
ADHD,"Heya I’m a male in his 20s. I’ve been diagnosed with adhd for almost of my life. I’ve been off my adhd for awhile, I had bad experiences with them before, but after experiencing a lot of anxiety and depression, taking meds for both and only seeing slight improvements, I decided after talking to my family and others in here, to really advocate to my psychiatrist that adhd medicine could help me. He agreeded, he was hesitant at first due to stimulants being able to raise anxiety, but he also said that adhd can be a helpful adjunct medication for depression, for those with or without adhd. It is the same medicine from my teenage years, so it’s better stuff but it wasn’t always my favorite from what little I can remember. I think now I am older, am on other medicines, and on a lower dose of this adhd medicine Focalin XR 10 milligrams, I feel like I have a shot at not feeling empty for most of the day. I’m a bit nervous that it wouldn’t help, or this and that, but I want to be optimistic. If this doesn’t work, I’m not sure what will, but man I’m kinda excited if I’m being honest. Am I crazy to be a bit excited and nervous? My anxiety has been so crazy, kinda hard to remeber what normal excitement is like.Getting medicine, mixed feelings",1635205219,1251,235

ADHD,"Ever since I was a kid, if I was watching a TV show, I would also be doing some other activity. Whether it be crafting or reading, or what have you. Now that cell phones have come into the picture, even when I am watching a TV show that I want to watch, I am still constantly on my phone. I’m either scrolling Facebook or googling random questions that pop into my head. I can focus on both things completely. I follow the show to a T and also get my research in. This absolutely bothers my husband and we’ve had many tiffs over it because he thinks if we’re going to be watching a show together I need to solely focus on that or I’m not paying attention. He gets upset because he says it feels like I’m not trying to have the quality time that I ask for. It seems to him when I multitask like this that I can’t possibly be paying attention to the show and that he should go do something else if I didn’t care to watch it. (I should mention that he is not the best at multitasking and when he is playing his game on the iPad he can barely have a coherent conversation because he can’t focus on both things.) I have told him that I can focus on both things but he still doesn’t think so, and I believe that’s because he himself can’t do it. I think I multitask like this because I indeed do want to watch the show in its entirety, but it’s not fully holding my interest, so I go on the phone and look up the questions I have answers to before I forget and things like that to keep me there. Does anyone else do this with the multitasking when it’s supposed to be quality time and does it bother your partner? Or does anyone just do what I do with the show thing in general?I drive my husband nuts doing this, but I can’t help myself",1635204427,1731,343

ADHD,I think one of the hardest parts of living with this curse is knowing how hard it is to succeed with it. Every neurotypical person can find their own neurotypical role model in their respective career fields but the only ADHD role models I have to look up to are people who are defined by their ADHD in the sense that they’ve built their lives in advocating for ADHD acceptance (which is important but where else do famous/high-achieving ADHD people generally end up? It’s like we can only be recognised for a lifetime of activism) I can’t name a single person with ADHD who has reached an impressive position in my field and I constantly wonder if I’m just doomed to fail for all eternity.

It’s hard going from laying in bed all the time with zero motivation to do work to sitting in a desk for hours doing work. If you can’t get out of bed then just sit in bed and do your work.

ADHD,"I hate having to rely on meds.I hate trying to find a combo of meds that work and looking like a drug addict :/.Here's some background on my situation:I had my first job a few years back in the summer(summer 2019) in a research position at my college, I was Hired b/c the pi who runs the lab was a former Prof of mine and I finished at the top of his class,, I lost it after a few months b/c the guy I worked under told the pi I wasn't paying attention to what I was told and I'd misplace things often and forget things I was told to do, at the time I was on Adderall 30mg XR, however I had been on that med at point for about 5 years so I must've developed tolerance which is why it wasn't working like it should..I didn't know the symptoms of adhd, I didn't know how tolerance developed,  or how meds worked until a year ago, I just let the job go  and went back to school full-time. After that summer, I started my junior year of college and was taking a full course load(18 hrs of college courses, real intense sciences), I almost failed my courses, I asked my doc if he could maybe increase the does of my meds, he did, he gave me the og 30mg XR+10mg ir Adderall (one in the morning, one in the afternoon), it's like the smoke cleared, I finished all my courses(but made a lot of C's, since the damage I done earlier in the sem couldn't be fixed at the time my Adderall dose was increased). The meds were great, I began the next semester of college and made all A's until I graduated. After graduation, I began studying for a grad school exam called the medical college admissions test (mcat), and the thing about this exam is that it's a 7 hour test, I took practice exams and did everything to prepare for it and during the preparation phase I realized the 10mg ir of Adderall was screwing me up, it'd wear off and I'd start making mistakes, but the time when it was working I'd do really well, so I decided to take the exam, but take a small amount of extra med before the 10 mg IR wore off and it helped, but I decided that once the exam was done I needed to change dosages, to all XR; I couldn't see myself taking 10mg ir for a long term, it wasn't sustainable b/c of how fast it wore off and a constant need to check the clock to monitor when my next dose would be. o after my exam was done I asked the doc to change my meds to all XR, he gave me 30mg Adderall XR+15mg XR Adderall and it turns out (According to my insurance), in my state(tx) the max dose you can take is 40mg a day, so he went over the limit by 5mg. I then made another appointment with the doc and also got my test results back for the mcat and didn't get the score that I wanted, so I decided I wanted to go back to the 30mg XR Adderall+10 mg IR Adderall (one in the morning and one in the evening), I had the appointment w/him and he said sure I'll put you back on what I had you on(mind you at this point I was going through withdrawal symptoms from the ir, so I was having trouble understanding what he was telling me, I think he said I'll put u back on what I had u on, which was 30mg XR+1 10mg ir in the afternoon), I said thanks and then went to pick up my meds the next day, however, the 10mg dosage only had 30 pills(Id always get 60 pills), I asked the pharmacist why there was only 30 pills and the pharmacist said the dose was once a day, I asked what was I on before, she said  I was on one 10mg twice a day which is why I  was receiving more previously. Alright, so I didn't pick up the 10mg pills and decided to make another appointment, waited a while to see my doc b/c of his vacation or something, so at this point Im about a month w/o the extra 10mg ir I used to take, I'm depressed, confused, feeling slowed down, I learned while studying for the mcat that all those symptoms are related to the withdrawal from the amphetamine,so I ate more and worked out to battle the withdrawal symptoms. I began studying for my test again on the lower dose and was doing poorly, state dependent memory is real and I was making a crap ton of recall errors on the lower dose of Adderall. I recently had my appointment with the doc and he told me he couldn't put me back on the extra 10mg ir that was twice a day, something about the DEA/insurance asking him why is he going back and forth with the dosages, and he can't be doing that...I said alright, can u give me 2 20mg of XR instead, he said sure and that's what I'm supposed to get soon...I'm worried I won't get the meds what if some other bs comes up or what if I get them and I do worse on my exam b/c the meds aren't as strong ;/ Why can't I have a ""normal"" brain that actually allows me to catch information.  All the trouble I went through to get this prescription made me feel like an addict :/. I just hate this...I hate relying on the meds(I tried quitting them, but I was wayy to confused and couldn't catch information, like having a conversation was extremely hard and following along w/the conversation was hard).

ADHD,"o, I've been on adderall xr 20 mg for the past 4 days. The first day I felt like I had a lot of energy, and I focused on doing important tasks I put off for so long. I felt really good. But the next 2 days I ended up taking vitamin c right after I took my medication, which probably interfered with the absorption.. so those days I felt really calm and tired, and the focus wasn't hitting as hard. I couldn't really sleep last night, and ended up sleeping later than I should've. Today I took the medication properly again, but it wasn't hitting as well as the first day still. It was still better than the past 2 days, and today was another productive day. But then by around hour 6 or 7 into my medication I had such a foggy brain. I was super tired and almost took a nap. I ended up eating a meal and taking some vitamins (which contained citric acid, idk if that was important) and i felt more energetic.

ADHD,"I have not been diagnosed with ADHD, but I am confident that I am lacking something very important in my decision-making/thinking/self-disciplinary abilities. I’ve been struggling immensely this past semester and much of last year. I am one of those people that get a sudden burst of motivation very rarely (maybe once every two weeks) and even then, I don’t get much of my school work/studying done. I am in my senior year of college as a biology major and have 3hrs of lecture MWF, and long labs on T and TR. I attend all of my classes regularly and can stay somewhat engaged and learn/take lots of notes, but once it is time to go home, I am dying to do something enjoyable like sleeping, watching youtube videos, going on tiktok, or basically anything to forget about school even though I have absurd amounts of HW and research projects to begin. I’ll have big plans for when I get home to knock out all of my assignments and studying, but once I step in the house I just don’t care anymore bc my mind craves something enjoyable and not boring.  feels like this is completely out of my control and that I’m doomed to fall short of success. I’m trapped in my mind and procrastinate until the last hour when I’m about to have an anxiety attack as a result of my own stupidity. I feel so lost, I don’t even know how I made it this far into my major. My mind makes things so much harder than it needs to be because it doesn’t wanna put in the effort. I know that I’m smart and capable but I just can’t tap in to that part of my brain.

ADHD,"I assume this is common with many of you. As a kid I got yelled at a lot by teachers, I was put in special education classes with students that had an array of behavioral disorders, I was brought to therapy, I had to sit in IEP meetings where my parents, teachers, and others discussed how difficult I was to deal with. All of this left a strong sense in me that I'll always be a kid, incapable of succeeding in a world of adults. Now, I've been assigned a project at work that for the last 30 years would have instead been given to a specific older colleague, and now that colleague is going around telling others how bad I'm messing it up. I think it's because he feels threatened by loosing this responsibility to me. To those that matter, my supervisor and his supervisor, I'm doing a fine job. But I'm having a really hard time knowing my work is being ridiculed constantly. I've put a lot of effort into developing a sense that I am a professional, a responsible adult of value.

ADHD,"TL;DR: I'm supposed to be sitting finals, my step-dad died suddenly and now I need to arrange everything on my own with an alcoholic mum while already feeling overwhelmed by studies. as I sat down to take one of my final exams for the masters I'm studying I received a call from my Mums neighbour telling me my step-dad is unwell and my Mum needs me. When I arrived 40 minutes later the paramedic told me he had died.  weren't really close but he was a good man who made my mum happy and did his best helping to raise me and my brother. He and my mum were never abusive but they both had a problem with alcohol so there were times growing up that were less than great, because of this I became more distant as I've grown up.

ADHD,"hello, i was recently diagnosed with adhd (combination inattentive/hyperactive) a little over 2 weeks ago. my psychiatrist prescribed 36mg generic methylphenidate (concerta), so i’ve also been taking that for over 2 weeks now.my psychiatrist listed out the most common side effects of the meds when she first went over the diagnosis (as most do), which included trouble sleeping, dry mouth, loss in appetite, and weight loss. i was most worried about loss in appetite and weight loss however, since i am a 5’3 girl and have a smaller frame. i’m extremely active and i’ve always been on the lower end of normal weight, but still normal. in other words, i couldn’t afford to lose much weight even before the meds, if at all.i have the other listed symptoms (they are manageable and don’t impact my self image), but not to the extent i have lost weight and my appetite. i have lost 7 pounds in the last 2 weeks. i’ve already become underweight. i’ve tried having high protein meals, like eggs, peanut butter, nuts and eating more carbs to help, but i feel like i just keep losing and losing. it’s so uncomfortable to force myself to eat everyday. i feel so nauseous. i absolutely hate this.i’m both afraid to stay on my meds and stop them. i generally function better on them. this is the most ive ever been able to focus and stay attentive in my life.…but i can’t keep losing weight. it’s destroying my confidence and self image. i’m kept up at night because of this. i miss how i was before the meds, except for the incredible focus i have now. i was happy with myself, how i looked, and how i acted. now, i feel like i’ve lost a part of myself and i avoid looking in mirrors at all costs. i’m so self conscious i just live in sweatshirts now. i can tell that i’m becoming more quiet and reserved because of this.thankfully i’m talking to my psych tomorrow. ill see what she says but i might just say that i need to get off these meds. i don’t feel like myself at all, and i’m terrified to get worse. i’m just looking for some reassurance at this point.losing weight really fast from meds….",1635199885,2089,380

When he is not picking his skin he is picking or pulling on threads of his clothing. I'm sure part of it is because of his medication and another part is because he is bored and doesn't really have any interest in the subject matter.

ADHD,I am in desperate need of help. My GP diagnosed me with adult adhd in June this year after misdiagnosing me with depression and bipolar disorder and then prescribed me methylphenidate which did not seem to be the right stimulant for me so I switched to a psychiatrist who then prescribed me 5mg adderall ir which didn’t improve anything and then upped my dose to 10mg ir and I felt like a whole new person but the effects only lasted half the day so she switched me to 10mg xr and now I’m right back to not feeling any effects from it and she refuses to switch me back to the instant release which would make a lot more sense for me to just take a 10mg ir in the morning and another in the afternoon because those actually worked for me. I don’t understand why she’s refusing to switch my dosage. I’m 23 years old and not at all abusing my medication I’m just trying to get the right dosage that I know I need and my psychiatrist has no other explanation on why she won’t switch me back to the ir other than she doesn't want to. I asked why she wouldn’t multiple times and her only answers were that she didn’t want toAdhd medication,1635199625,1133,217

My saving grace is if those capsules are shit, I'll still have my glorious 180 count prescription of Mayne manufactured Desoxyn to roll back on.  advice is appreciated.SPECGX Spansules?",1635199519,680,118
ADHD,"everal years ago, my mother wrote me a script on how to request a perscription refill over the phone because I always dreaded and put off calling for one until I had already run out. I still have [the exact piece of paper]( just chilling loose in my room and my brain somehow always happens to remember exactly where it is whenever I need to use it. I often just have to call my pharmacy instead of my literal doctor to get a refill, but the paper makes sure I have a general idea of what I need to say/ask for plus the relevant names and numbers I need on hand to help the call go smoothly. gotten much better at booking appointments and making necessary phone calls on my own since, but every so often I still write down what I need to say or ask for on a scap piece of paper before I hit dial. ometimes things go off script, but having an outline on paper helps immensely with keeping my brain on track and making sure I dont forget why I was calling as soon as the other person picks up. o if you find yourself dreading making important and time sensitive calls, try writing yourself a script!having a script on hand makes phone calls so much easier",1635199415,1153,222

ADHD,"Do you have and follow a strict sleeping routine? How does it work for you? I personally think having a bed and wake up set up helps a lot but i struggle to manage it. I be curious to hear how you’re dealing with it. work at 9am waking up at 5am it feels great, i start my day peacefully, I can use that time to work on personal things and be quickly and efficiently ready for work. In contrast when I wake up at 7-7:30 this is usually more chaotic, and it takes me double or triple time to get ready. problem with waking up early is that I have to sleep earlier like 9:30pm to get good sleep. And I find it hard to end the day so quick when there are other things to do like cook, and catch up with friends and conversations especially as I finish around late 6pm.  am accustomed to short sleep of 3-5 hours if I need, and on average I probably sleep about 6 hours, it’s hard to wake up if I don’t catch up on sleep but I can function as normal but good sleep in the morning   helps boosting the morning motivation. you probably guessed what I usually end up doing 😅 I working and trying to do too much in a day? hould I have that stop button, do you?

ADHD,"I recently turned twenty and ever since I was very young I was told by teachers and family members that I’m a bright kid, I just need to apply myself. In elementary school, I excelled in reading and history classes, however it was extremely hard for me to focus in any kind of math class. To this day I cannot properly do Long division. Teachers would also frequently comment about my extremely poor organizational skills. Every single year, my desk would be a mess by the end of the first week.  trend continued into both middle and high school. I was able to keep good grades throughout most of elementary and middle school (with the exception of math and science classes in certain cases), but my grades slipped dramatically in high school. It wasn’t so bad my freshman and sophomore year, however by junior year, it was borderline impossible to bring myself to homework for almost any class unless it involved some element that I was interested in. I could stay afloat in certain classes, but I failed and had to retake many math and science classes. I was just barely able to graduate.  also always been a daydreamer. My teacher in kindergarten told my parents I was “off in lala land” too often when I was supposed to be doing something or paying attention. This trend also continued into high school and beyond. It got a little better, but if I’m not engaged in the task at hand, I’m off in my own head. ometimes fantasizing about whatever movie or music I’m interested in, or having “conversations” with people I know. This causes me to be unintentionally careless very often.  certain contexts, depending on the environment, people assume I’m either very intelligent or very dumb. I have a lot of social anxiety and a lot of it stems from not knowing who and when to be myself around. I’m also extremely self conscious about the way I’m perceived.  working on personal projects I become almost obsessive. I have to give something my all or nothing. This results in long periods of doing nothing followed by bursts of creativity and productivity.  been diagnosed with GAD and panic disorder after a couple intense panic attacks, but I’ve suspected more recently that it’s deeper than that, and that I may either have ADHD or OCD.

ADHD,"This is by far my biggest issue I’ve had for the past 2/3 years and I can say it’s really affected me in the past year. At first I thought “this is normal I’m just tired today and not in the mood to talk” but as time went on I started to notice that it was a constant cycle and i feel so trapped within myself and this is really ruining my mental health to the point where I’ve had to take time off work and been deeply depressed where I can’t even put a sentence together at points. Before I had a mad ADHD burnout fairly recently I had a good routine in place, where I would go to the gym before work, I would prepare all my meals for the day, I would have a good idea of what I needed to do at work and everything felt like it was in place. I would wake up and already know what I’m going to do, what I was going to say when I seen a specific individual and just as a whole life seemed in place and my brain worked autonomously and I didn’t have to force it to work it would just kind of do its own thing. This would last for about half an hour which is when my brain almost goes into a trance and I’m just stuck within my head and when I go out into the gym I struggle to socialize and when people speak To me, my answers are very generic and I don’t show a whole lot of engagement and almost feel like I’m trying to end any interaction that I am having just because it’s not a genuine talk I’m having in the back of my head this thought where I’m giving answers to almost avoid it making it awkward.

ADHD,"I just had a brief conversation on another post about this subject and wanted to expand on it for anyone who can benefit from this. For anyone who doesn't know what ""brain noise"" (BN) is:  many people with ADHD have a sensitivity to sound and/or lack of sound. They can be EAILY distracted from things or not properly motivated to function and complete things. Because of this lack of (or over) mental stimulation, the brain just gets busy just being busy and it's more generally known as ""brain noise"" (racing thoughts, day dreaming, inner monologs, ear-worms from song lyrics, POT TRAUMA events, anxiety trips 😩, etc). way of describing it: It can be seen as the same type of non-noise that many people have when they go to sleep and require a fan to dull out real noise and BN. anyone who struggles with high levels of BN and can't have regular type music playing while doing tasks (studying, reading, learning, working), PLEAE give lofi music a try. I'll share my collection I have stored on YouTube. You can flip though all the different videos until one of them really resonates with you or even research your own style (chill hop, lofi hip hop, jazzy, sythwave, Cafe, etc). be respectful though. You might not like this music, but Lofi is essential for my personal focus. I have been listening to YouTube channels and potify channels on this type of music for a few years now. It dulls out the BN far better than any other type of ""music"". I have had people tell me that lofi isn't music and its boring/annoying and its so insulting. This is MY medication. MY metronome. I NEED this to function. Other typical music is TOO stimulating. I want to sing along to songs, daydream about playing the instruments, look up the lyrics, or other curious factors about music that pops into my distracted head. Even playing the new song I found over and over and over, which many of us ADHD brains do.  style is my game changer. I hope everyone can find it beneficial or even share what you do to dull out the BN for other who want help. Good luck!Who else uses ""Lofi"" music for ""brain noise""?",1635197137,2088,376

We had quite a complicated relationship in the beginning but after about 6 months of seeing eachother we realised we wanted to be together and everything is great. Now about 2 months ago I finally was able to start my medication and which hasn't worked great so far. I really feel the medication helping when I study and it's almost amazing how much more I can get done but on the other hand my emotions get all over the place.I start to overthink what happened when real relationship a lot more compared to before I took the medication. Right now everything feels overwhelming with the relationship, uni and work and my gf really tries to be supporting and ask how she can help and I can't come up with a reasonable answer. I was thinking of talking with her about taking a short break ( 1 or 2 weeks) just to try sort things trough and figure out what is happening with me and what areas I could need her support in. My thought is to take a break next week when our university has a lot of parties and we  no longer would be exclusive because when we started dating  she didn't want anything serious because she just started university. I won't go to the parties myself more looking for some time alone and maybe seeing a few friends since I haven't really had the energy to spend time with them since I started the medication. problem is that I feel like either this would come across as I have an alternative motive/have lost feelings or that this could eventually hurt our relationship in the long run. am going to talk to her either way this week about how I'm feeling but I would really like som input either if this sounds absolutely insane or how your relationships were affected by medication and how you handled that. this was so long.. if I was unclear at any point just ask and I will try to clear it up, I'm not great at proof reading haha. Just started medication and having troubles with relationship.I really need advice",1635194510,2105,388

ADHD,"10:30pm I guess but it will probably stay this way until midnight can’t sleep because of side effects of my meds. I didn’t have this problem at all at this dosage before (i had a week break) but now I can’t sleep, I get a high heart rate after meds wear off and generally feel really shit. I just want to be able to focus and be able to sleep but I can’t have both. don’t know what to do. Idk if this is some side effect that will go away or what. Maybe this is just something my body needs to get used to again but how should I know that?  really really wish I didn’t need medication but I do. I’m so sick of worrying about my heart rate and sleeping and everything. It was going so well for 2 months, a magical pill that solves all my problems, no side effects, I even stopped getting headaches when coming down! But now I got my dosage increased (or at least tried to) and I guess I didn’t take meds for a week cause I got married and even my dosage before the increase taken in the morning doesn’t let me sleep. Wore off at 1:30pm, raised my heart rate until 7pm and now at 10:30pm I’m feeling absolutely exhausted and barely conscious but not at all sleepy. The 4 hour pill is still causing problems 13+ hours after taking it. 10mg methylphenidate a dosage a friend of mine called “piss-low”  feel so hopeless. I just want the effect I originally had.

ADHD,"I used to love reading but over the years it’s just become to hard for me. I’m a good auditory learner, I remember everything I hear, and I love podcasts and talk radio, so my therapist suggested I try audiobooks. But I need something to do while I listen to the books.  I’m listening to podcasts/talk radio, I’m using it more for background noise and I’m not really paying attention to it. I actually want to pay attention to the audiobooks and not miss stuff.  tried listening to my first audiobook today and didn’t make it very long just sitting there staring into space. I ended up browsing Reddit and you can’t read and listen to an audiobook at the same time. Then I tried playing solitaire on my phone and that worked for a little while but I would find myself mindlessly hopping back onto other apps where I’d be reading things, again distracting myself from the audiobook. o I don’t think being on my phone is a good activity. really like arts and crafts so I’m open to that as an idea but I was hoping for something.. idk I guess more easy and instantaneous.

ADHD,"I started taking medication after being diagnosed with inattentive ADHD several months ago, and one of the goals I spoke about with my psychiatrist was that I hoped that I could maintain a consistent level of productivity, and feel confident that I could accomplish the goals I set for the day. Before being medicated, I described the feeling as something like being afraid of waking up because I wouldn't be sure how I would feel, which would influence how productive I could be, which would influence my mood. I basically felt like I had no control over my brain, and would wake up and feel anxious about whether or not I would wake up as the ""productive mentally healthy me"" or the ""depressed/distracted unproductive me."" my productivity has been better since I've started my meds, I still find my it somewhat varies significantly from day to day. I used to try to ""brute force"" productivity, and work on the same thing for hours in an attempt to get at least *something* done before the end of the day, with diminishing returns each time I tried to refocus my attention; this still happens to some degree, and now I'm wondering if there's something wrong with me. guess my fears are 1) I am inherently lazy and undisciplined, and my mom is correct :-), 2) that I will be this way forever, and 3) I will never find any system that works for me. Does anyone else struggle with the same thing, and have you found any ways to remedy it? an additional caveat, I also have received warnings from my psychiatrist that I shouldn't be on meds just to be a better worker or student, and I should view it from a more general quality of life perspective. While I do think meds have generally improved my quality of life, I still think that this whole issue with productivity is hampering my goals and hopes that I could have more free time for doing things that I enjoy.Advice for feeling like my productivity is completely at the mercy of my brain's/body's whims?",1635193672,1956,351
ADHD," Hello. I got diagnosed with adult ADHD this summer and I started taking Adderall XR (genetics) since August. My first initial dose was Adderall XR 10mg and it didn't do anything. then the next visit, I got Adderall XR 20mg and it seemed to help more without having any side effects (except I get a headache for 30min to 1 hour when the drug hits the peak). I found out a problem that if I take XR in the morning, it doesn't last until night. be honest, I don't even think this drug lasts more than 8 hours because I get headache around 6 hours after I take the drug and then it eventually wears off. issue is that I'm a medical student and I have to study at least 12 hours per day. I usually study in the morning for like 5\~6 hours and take some time off, going back to study again, time off, etc. And at night, I think I can study most efficiently but this is when the drug effect is gone. Everyday, I get no motivation and I waste 1-2 hour by just trying to get back to the study mode. (And even if I start studying, I can't focus as easily). addressed this issue to my physician yesterday, and he said we can try Adderall IR twice daily. thought that's a good idea if I can take once in the morning and once at night. my physician said my daily dose can't exceed more than 20mg so if I end up taking IR, it has to be 10mg twice daily. And I know XR 10mg didn't do anything to me last time, I'm worried. seen other people in this post who take like 30mg XR in the morning and 10mg IR at night. (I know everyone's got different conditions). I just don't get why my physician believes 20mg is the maximum dose for everyone. my question is, will having 10mg IR twice daily will help my situation better? say I study the most 8-12pm, 1-5pm, 8-12am. you think taking IR in the morning and around afternoon will help me better? said I can't even take it three times a day unless I break it down to 10mg, 5mg, and 5mg. will just not prescribe me more than 20mg per day when I don't even believe 20mg is really helping me enough. It might be just me, but I still feel lots of hunger even with this drug, I get distracted when the drug should kick the effect, and I get no other side effect except a headache at a peak. It might be because I used to drink like 5\~8 shots of coffee per day before I got diagnosed to ADHD? I don't know. help me. hould I stay with XR 20mg once daily or IR 10mg twice daily? you.Adderall XR vs IR",1635193606,2423,479
ADHD,"I think the term ""everyday carry"" was coined by gun culture, but it's become a hobby of sorts focussed on filling your pockets with all the things you may need throughout the day. Think of the Boy couts' ""Be Prepared"" slogan. Anywho, I've embraced it for several reasons.  1: It's a hobby that's easy to maintain even for those of us who rotate through hobbies like most people rotate their socks, because it largely consists of buying useful (and usually inexpensive) items and gadgets and then putting them in your pockets. That's a hobby I can maintain. 2: it's really helping me stay organized and know where my shit is. Not sure why, I guess it's tricking my brain with ""these aren't daily responsibilities, this is a hobby!"" I pretty much always know where my keys and wallet are, as well as a bunch of other stuff. And while it sounds like having more stuff to not forget would be harder, for some reason it isn't. I guess once you're thinking ""but what if I'm stranded in the woods...?"" as you walk out the door, you know where your damn keys are. 3 is probably my favorite: I've been prepared for things I should've but wasn't. Yesterday I got caught in the rain (I didn't like it, nor do I like pina coladas) but just happened to have an emergency parka in my glovebox. Best of all, I solved my problem of getting halfway to wherever before I realize I forgot basic hygiene. I put together a kit with all the essentials (deodorant, body spray, lens cleaner, soap, hand sanitizer and more) that is small enough to fit in a pocket. I can't post photos or crosspost here, but I hope it's ok to link to where I shared it on the EDC sub, because I'm pretty proud of it.  4: it's just fun to be the guy who has everything. ""Does anybody have a pen?"" Right here. ""I need a lighter...wait, you don't even smoke!"" Doesn't mean I won't need fire, baby. ""Do you have a blade handy?"" No. I have 4. not saying this will work for everyone, as alike as we all are, we still have differences. But it works for me, and I find it fun. There are a lot of people who have pistols as part of their EDC, so if that bothers you, maybe stay away from the community. I'm not a huge fan myself, but people showing you the weapons they keep as part of their carry are usually not being dicks about it. Anyhow, check it out if it sounds interesting, and if you already do it, how many flashlights do you keep on you?EDC (everyday carry) as a coping strategy",1635193385,2439,459

ADHD,I've nodded along with those posts too. I know how frustrating it is to consistently maintain substantial friendships when we have mental health issues. thought it might be an insightful exercise to envision what we would like to see more widely accepted as a friendship template instead of solely focusing on what we do not like about current definitions. curious what a good friendship dynamic would look like for you. How often would you meet? What would your communication expectations and boundaries look like? How would you foster intimacy and care in such a relationship? What aspects of the currently normal expectations of friendship would you like to see changed and how?What is your ideal vision of friendship? In many posts here we lament our inability to keep in touch with friends or mourn how typical friendship expectations do not suit us.,1635192684,855,142

Or do you ask your GP to send you to a psychiatrist and do you need an appointment for that or can they just send you the contact info?

First month was great, ruminating thoughts were kept to a minimum, I was not overwhelmed by mounting responsibilities, I was able to effectively prioritize parts of tasks. It felt very clean and I could feel it when it ""kicked in"".Onto the second month, I went up to 20mg daily as I could feel a slight loss of effectiveness and going up to 20 had been the plan.

ADHD,Hello Redditors who might suffer from both ADHD and depression. How can you differentiate between the two? I'm having second thoughts about my ADHD diagnosis as Concerta makes me in my opinion happier or do ADHD meds make everybody happier? And I don't mean high happy or manic. Just contentment and overall happy mood? read that Concerta can be used for drug resistant depression also so I'm wondering maybe Concerta is treating just that?How to differentiate depression from ADHD,1635189107,481,79
ADHD,Anybody else feel depressed and over all gloomy on adderall before it wears off? From my understanding thats an effect of it wearing off but lately ive been feeling it from the start.

And i am more stressed now than usual but theres not really a reason for me to really feel down like i do when i take it. this normal? Have any of you ever felt like this?

ADHD,"**\*TL;DR at end of post.** think I have introduced myself on the women ADHD subs, but maybe not here? I'm 21 years old and I've been in college for four years now. I'm a graphic design major, and it has become my nightmare. Initially I chose graphic design because it felt like the best way to push my love of art into a career path that my parents would support. I had a few years of Photoshop experience under my belt going into this major so I figured it would be right up my ally; it is not. my junior year finished up last semester, I figured I should just stick it out. I really, really struggled in graphic design I, but a few things kept me in it:  I had only been in one course that was entirely graphic design oriented. * The prerequisites for the art program are extensive, and of course, unique to that department. I can only switch to an art teaching major or a studio major--otherwise I'll have to tack on like an extra two years of undergrad.* My department head stepped down. o last semester I had a temporary, unusual advisor that had a difficult time guiding me.* The graphic design program is small, but last spring they were in the process of hiring a new professor. I wanted to give them a chance to see if their teaching methods might make things click for me?  was a huge mistake. I go to a four year institution in my hometown, and my dad manages a business here. Well, all of my dad's staff quit in early August. I worked for him all summer and told him this was likely to happen because I knew my coworkers attended universities in other cities. He was aware of this as well, but he just kind of let it happen and never hired any new employees. was pissed, but I've kind of just accepted my reality at this point. He pays for my college so I felt uncomfortable mentioning that his lack of staffing could be a real problem for me. Additionally, I'm kind of on my ""last chance"" for receiving college funding from him. Throughout my freshman and sophomore years (pre ADHD diagnosis) I failed like upwards of like six classes. A lot of money down the drain. I'm still working through how to stop feeling so guilty for this in therapy because it seriously injured my relationship with my dad. I have been a lot more successful academically since then. I know I am really lucky that he cares enough to be disappointed and that he even began funding my education in the first place, but I feel like I owe him all my success. I know he wouldn't want me to feel this way, but I can't seem to find peace. ANYWAY--me and two other coworkers were expected to just brave it out, taking on insane hours, until the weather turns so shit that the golf course will have to close for the season. Instead, my two coworkers (rightfully so) just told my dad, ""Hey max I can work is two days a week during school"". I told him I could be out there when he needed me. chool hadn't started up yet and I felt optimistic and inclined. so silly for seriously continuing to believe I can juggle everything and more ""*this time""*.  during the first week of this Fall semester, my parents went on a week long vacation. Instead of boarding our family pets (two cats and a dog), they asked me to stay at my childhood home for the week and take care of them. It's only 5 minutes from campus-- so not a terrible gig, except I have two cats in addition to our family pets. One of them is only eight months old so he's already kind of a nightmare. don't know why I'm going into this much detail, but it feels good to actually put this situation down and out somewhere so I feel less crazy and alone. I'm sorry for the length.* during the first week of school:  I have no clean laundry because I've been working so many hours in the last weeks of summer.* I'm staying at my fucking childhood home with four cats (that are not well acquainted) and a dog.* I forgot my ADHD meds on vacation like three weeks earlier, and am unable to get a refill.* I have no groceries because my parents didn't think to stock the fridge.* I'm in 15 credits and also working a \~25 hour work week. the first month of classes I had to drop from 15 to 9 credits. The three classes I kept are studio courses, which require a total of 18 hours in class and a ton of homework. About a month ago my mom told me they were going out of town for four days, and asked for me to watch all the pets again.   response: I lost my shit, made them feel horrible (unintentionally, of course), and now I'm only being scheduled \~10 hours on weekends. But it was already too late I guess? my semester is a complete dumpster fire that I can't seem to put out. never caught up on my schoolwork, and I was never taught even the most basic aspects of illustrator/indesign (we use these programs for every assignment). Every project I do takes an eternity, and my professor isn't having it.  sure she has a poor impression of me because of the amount of class I missed initially due to work (3 classes). It's her first year here, and I was really excited to take graphic design with a new professor, so I have tried really hard to be really involved in class since my initial absences. have since sent her two emails being 100% transparent (regarding ADHD, work, etc) and she didn't respond to either of them. When I addressed it in class all she responded with was that she, ""received them"". I didn't know how to respond (I had hoped it was a miscommunication as English is her second language), so I just chalked it up to being unimportant.  an entire project behind, and we are in the second half of this semester at this point. I sent her an email about potentially meeting to discuss how I could address/tackle my missing work outside of class, and she hasn't responded or acknowledged it in person. this point, I should mention that throughout this semester I have sent three inquiries asking to adjust my accommodations via tudent Accessibility ervices. Each inquiry received an automated response saying that ""no members of A were available to meet during my requested time."" After the third auto-response, I sent a really rude email titled ""Please Meet With Me"" and I basically alluded their service being mega shit--since they can't even get back to three separate, desperate inquiries.  finally got a response that had no greeting (which I deserved I guess?) and simply said, ""What times would work for you to meet?"" Of course, because of my unkind email, I didn't want to meet any longer.  I come to find out that the entire A program has essentially dissolved this semester. The website has the header ""taff"", but all the employee photos and names are no longer there. Turns out the staff received offers to work elsewhere, took them, and haven't been replaced. o right now I attend a university without a working accommodation program.* in the time that I'm reaching out to these university resources, I'm kind of falling apart at home. I haven't had groceries in two months, I'm regularly calling my mom sobbing asking for help that she can't really provide, I'm grasping at straws to try and catch up, and I'm still working every weekend.  god I was able to get into a therapist my doctor recommended, but she's booked out until late November.* the meantime, I get a phone call from my dad that he is resigning from his job of 26 years. Now, both my parents are unemployed, and I'm seriously doubting my ability to pass a single class this semester. I *know* I don't want to be a graphic design major anymore at this point, but I'm worried that I can't financially afford to switch majors because I can't even manage 10 hours of work right now.  graphic design 2 professor hasn't given me any concrete feedback about my current position in her class despite my multiple inquiries, and I'm feeling incredibly hopeless lol. Everything really started to get to me so I skipped a few classes claiming ""COVID symptoms"" (excused) in attempt to try and grind out my missing work. No luck! what ended up being my fucking breaking point is our most recent project in my graphic design class. Our latest project is to create three poster designs for a ""social or environmental issue"". They're supposed to be about something we are passionate about/can relate to. Wednesday in class we pitched our ideas, and I went last. A classmate of mine was approved to do the impact of textiles/fast fashion in global warming, another was approved for Americanization, Black Lives Matter was approved, and so was animal testing.  pitch was about how mental illness is underfunded and glanced over. Her response was, verbatim, ""You need to revisit the project criteria and pick a social or environmental issue."" I was the only one not approved for my topic, and it was embarrassing and confusing.  I'm doing deforestation. I'm having difficulty getting started on my posters, and I'm not in class today again because I am seriously at a loss. Last night I decided to drop another course which puts me, now, at only 6 credits. boyfriend has been a huge support to me throughout this entire semester, but things haven't been ""looking up"" for months now. I feel stuck in an absolute rut. Whenever I get anxious/sad/quiet and he asks me ""what's up?"", I feel like I'm beating a freaking dead horse. just don't know how to approach the rest of this semester. I don't know how to approach the discrimination I *feel* like I have faced at this university (which also just feels like I'm being overdramatic). I don't have time to take care of myself because my workload is just constantly looming over me.  minute I spend not *thinking* about my outstanding and current assignments feels like a waste, let alone the time where I'm not doing my assignments. :( don't want to drop out completely because I'm not financially independent enough to pay my dad back or pursue a degree elsewhere. Even if I *was*, I feel like this is all my own fault for not being able to properly manage my time.  semester has just hurt so damn bad because when I noticed was struggling I actually chose to reach out to every resource in my power, and nothing changed. I feel like maybe I'm just not cut out for higher education. already have a reputation for skipping classes in my department, and this semester has just been this horrible, enhanced version of the flake that I know that I am. This turned into such a fucking essay but I just feel very alone. Every foreseeable option feels so hopeless because I have been trying to receive help and just general feedback for nearly three months straight now. remember being so excited for this semester, this new opportunity, and this major. I'm not expecting any sort of concrete financial/career advice or suggestions. Hell, if you read this far, that means so much to me. If this just read as one long bitch, I'm really sorry, please just let me know so I can take it down. anyone can relate or even provide feedback on what I could've done to address these past three months in a way that might have prevented this current outcome--I appreciate it. Again, if you read all of this, I just want to thank you so much for your time, care, and interest regarding my situation.  *hahahaha* am really struggling in school, and I can't catch up. I feel like I have exhausted my resources, and I can't get into my therapist for a little while. My parents are both unemployed, and I'm worried about my future as a student despite only having \~2 semesters left. I can't complete my course load, and I'm feeling like a failure. I committed early on to responsibilities that I couldn't manage, and now everything has piled up. It feels like just another day of being unfit for college/adult life in general, but I am feeling maybe the most hopeless I've ever felt-- and I am not taking care of my daily needs. I guess I just wanted to document this semester, but really, any sort of feedback (supportive, please, even if it's painful/honest) means a lot to me. Thank you a lot for your time. I apologize for the book. Maybe I will feel embarrassed in the next couple of hours and take this all down, **who knows!** ending lots of love out there to this community!! I feel very lucky to have access to so many people, of various walks of life, who are also navigating the world with/of ADHD! o thank you! &lt;3 :)I'm drowning in college (again). I miss the years where I didn't know ADHD was the root of many of my poor habits and behaviors.

Everyone else left me behind and I was never able to catch up. In 7th grade I tested at a 3rd grade math level, but my reading comprehension was at a college level. I think because people can see me read an entire book in a few hours, but struggle so much with math they just assume I’m being lazy or don’t want to learn it. I do, desperately, want to learn how to overcome this. It feels like no matter how many times I try or someone explains something to me, it doesn’t stick.

These are my side effects. 2 negative, 3 positive. ADHD vets please help if you know a remedy for sleep.** **Immediately noticed the improvement in physical execution Day 1**. For example, I get up and shower, and actually HOWER in the shower, no complication or overthinking about it because I had #HygieneAndelfMaintenanceProblems. Now, self-care is easy. **My thoughts are going slow enough that I practice putting them in order, forming healthier thought habits.** Don't get me wrong- my depressive and anxious thoughts still occur at first- but my response is actual ration and the thought ends there. My old ""ration"" was to dissociate, then ruminate, leading to anxiety increase &amp; racing thoughts. (Even how sequential and cohesive my thoughts translate to this post is not really how it normally comes out. I used to be (as in like 4 days ago) too scared to post on here, but everything is much different now.)    **POITIVE:** ocial anxiety, fear of rejection, depersonalization lessened. I feel more like myself. **My amygdala is on vacation and my frontal lobe just clocked in.**    **Those are my good symptoms. Here's my bad ones:**   **NEGATIVE: I can't sleep.** The starting dose is small, only 30mg, which is why I can't decide if I was misdiagnosed, or if this is simply my first reaction. I'm tracking everything, &amp; my sleep over 3 days/72hrs under medication, has been 13hrs. Typically it's 4hrs each night, between 4-8AM, and the only reason I wake is because I need to take it again early enough (7AM) to where I doesn't keep me up at night. It clearly doesn't work because I stay up. I've heard of people slipping into psychosis and/or mania with sleep deprivation and want to avoid that. Vyvanse make me less sensitive and more thoughtful rather than euphoric, or agitated, or run by a motor. Nor do I hear things/feel strange. If anything I felt strange and agitated before this.    **NEGATIVE:** Last thing, **my throat fucking hurts.** As if there's a physical representation of a cough just sitting on my windpipe, always waiting to come out with pain. I have hoarse voice, and have to be silent, or it hurts. This causes social withdraw because talking makes my windpipe itch and tense more. I also have runny nose as well.  I've concluded two POIBLE reasons based on my ^(unqualified) research:   **---**Vyvanse **&lt;** caused INUITI **&lt;** caused POTNAAL DRIP. Mucus could be going down my soft plate, from my nose, past my tongue, down my esophagus, and  into my windpipe, which could cause acute bronchitis.  **---**Vyvanse reacts in the stomach **&lt;** causing ACID REFLUX **&lt;** which makes the acid go up my esophagus, then propels a cough, making it travel up to my windpipe.  somethin fuckin wrong w my throat, maybe lungs. my long ass post, hopefully I will be an ADHD Vet soon, and some lost person, recently diagnosed, could read this all and be able to relate and find relief.***Sleepless+common cold symptoms on Vyvanse(30mg).

ADHD,"Now before you all come at me, I'm okay with people self-diagnosing themselves as long as they did months or even years of research. I'm talking about the people who are diagnosing themselves with just the basics and not looking deeper into it.  hate it when people say, ""I think I have ADHD because I'm restless"". That's not how it works. someone who has been diagnosed with ADHD, I can tell you that there is much more to ADHD than just being restless and fidgeting. And I really fucking hate it when you tell me you think you have it just because you have a couple well-known symptoms. Just because you have symptoms doesn't mean you actually have it. And I'm really fucking tired of you telling me you think you have it when it's obvious that you've never done a single second of fucking research in your life.  not saying you don't have it, I'm saying you're full of shit for saying that you think you have it when you obviously have never done any fucking research because you're basing your diagnosis off of two symptoms. ADHD for me is really hard and by telling me you think you have it just because you have a couple of symptoms, you are really undermining my experience and others with having the diagnosis (self or doctored).  if you really think you have it, go get tested. Don't tell me you think you have it just because you're restless and fidgeting, actually go get tested and then come back to me.  you think you have it and you cannot afford to get tested, you need to do months or even years of research. Don't just look at two symptoms and be like ""oh I have this"". Actually do your research instead of basing it off of TikToks or a couple articles.  remember if you're doing research that many disabilities and disorders have the same symptoms, so you may think you have one thing and then you may actually have another.  you are self-diagnosed and you have done the proper research, kudos to you, you guys are cool in my book. you are self diagnosed and you are diagnosing yourself based off of a few symptoms and you haven't done any actual research whatsoever, get off of Reddit and go do your research.I'm so fucking tired of people self diagnosing themselves after hearing two symptoms and deciding that they have ADHD",1635185000,2245,408

ADHD,"I normally wouldn’t post this on Reddit, but this community is mad accepting and I need to get this off my chest. I love my parents and I think they worked hard to be good role models, but I can’t help but think about the ways in which I’m stuck dealing with learning and unlearning because of my childhood undiagnosed ADHD.  22 years old and a woman and I’m furious. My early childhood was really stressful because I was such a bad kid. When I was 4-7 my parents and I had an extremely contentious relationship. I threw tantrums frequently and was awful at regulating my emotions. My dad would yell at me for having no self-control and threaten to take me to a doctor if I didn’t stop acting like this. I couldn’t understand how other kids didn’t want to argue or yell back or scream or kick my door till I left marks or hit my sister. I really internalized that thought that I don’t have self control and it ate away at me.  these “bad behaviors” didn’t manifest in school at all. I loved learning and was very passionate about it. I did my homework every morning a half hour before walking to school because I knew it wouldn’t take long and I was an excellent bull-shitter. I got great grades and great standardized test scores and was considered gifted. My sister was the opposite. he really struggled in school and could not focus. They took her in to get tested and she had ADHD-I (ADD at the time) and they tried medication for like a week, but were reluctant to continue because my mom (a nurse) is wary of medication like that.  high school things started to change. I could no longer wait until the last minute and my grades suffered as a result. Every teacher and my parents were so disappointed in me because I should have been getting A’s. I had so much “wasted potential.” I begged my parents to let me go to a therapist because I had so much anxiety, especially after I was hanging out with friends. It took a year of convincing and a lot of financial shaming, but eventually they let me go. The therapist did work with me on anxiety but she remarked that it was a bit strange that my anxiety occurred after being around people and not before.  got by enough to get into my home state university, but flunked my second semester to the point that I was almost in a complete state of depersonalization. I got on antidepressants at this point and continued college doing a little better, but still struggling to force myself to do anything.  worked during college to pay what wasn’t covered by loans, because I didn’t qualify for aid or scholarships and didn’t have any help from my parents. I really liked my job as a unit coordinator at a children’s hospital. Interacting with kids was so fun and I thought I was doing well. When I got my review back at the end of my first year I was somewhat shocked. “he is a delightful face to see on the unit and her demeanor is excellent, but she gets distracted easily and forgets tasks assigned to her.” I had a moment of realizing that my forgetfulness must be more than most otherwise they wouldn’t mention it. began asking people close to me if I was more forgetful than others and began researching adhd. Interrupting, forgetting, disorganized, poor motivational salience. All of these were so true to the core of my being, and my friends agreed. My mom always grew so sick of my horrific time management. But I did good in school? I could focus easily on painting for hours and if the lecture was interesting I was a perfect student. I was never staring out the window or tapping my fingers. I was biting my nails and picking my face though. I was assessing everyone’s outfits during class.  story short I was finally diagnosed last spring and medication makes me feel like I finally have some control in my life. I’ve even come to realize that my dad and my grandmother also likely have adhd.  now I’m pissed! o much of my life I was told I had no self control and that it was a personality issue. he’s so hardheaded they’d say. Who tf am I? Why do I have to figure this out now and why didn’t my parents actually do something besides blame me my whole life? I want to have a good relationship with them because they genuinely are good people, but I’m so frustrated and I need them to know that they failed me in that way. They also seem to brush off my mentioning of ADHD and don’t think I should be medicated. It’s so much work to navigate my identity and the world while also having to teach myself how to be an adult.

ADHD,"Anyone else have people comment that ""It seems like you've lived 10 different lives!"" or constantly remark about how interesting you are because of all the things you've done, all the places you've been all the things you've achieved but then those relationships never really develop into maturity?  I've been plagued with that my entire adult life and as someone who's been very recently diagnosed I'm coming to realize that a big part of my impulsivity is oversharing and not really being able to moderate my interactions as well as I should so at first meeting I come off as very interesting but after a while its overwhelming and off-putting.   any of you come up with better ways to deal with this other than just being quiet or speaking only when spoken to?

ADHD,"Hey! This question has been bouncing around my mind for a little while and in true ADHD fashion I paused in the middle of something to write this. was officially diagnosed with ADHD less than two years ago (I'm 21) after badgering my parents long enough about taking me to a psychiatrist who would take me seriously. This is less about me, though, and more about my brothers. almost certain that all three of my brothers (19, 15 and 13) all have either ADHD, autism, or both. At least 19 has been diagnosed with one or the other (they kept changing depending on the doctors my parents saw), 15 grew up with a speech delay, and 13 is literally my clone in terms of our ADHD habits and personalities. They all still live with my parents. parents can honestly be pretty emotionally/verbally abusive, and were physically abusive when 19 and I were younger. They've gotten better these days but it's still not amazing. I worry a lot about my brothers growing up in that environment because I'm still unpacking all of it myself. I'm a 21 year old uni student who lives in a different country and is financially dependent on them so I feel like there's so little I can do for them. question is how can I go about helping them? 13 is the only one who, as far as I know, hasn't seen a professional or doctor about it. My parents are resistant to the idea of taking him to one, but they're in a more financially stable place in their lives now so I might bring it up again. I'm considering showing them videos and books and stuff that could help them be, well, better parents to my bros than they were to me in terms of tackling their ADHD. Any suggestions? could I do to help my bros directly as well? How do I teach them coping mechanisms and ways to lead more fulfilling lives? How do I teach them how to make friends and be good people? orry if that's a lot of questions but I'm honestly open to all advice relating to this.How do I help siblings with ADHD?",1635184048,1951,366

I'm really just kinda wondering if there are other adults that are in a similar position and if you have any retention techniques when you can just Google it. As I'm getting older of course it's getting worse and I'm kinda tired of Googling the same thing again 2 weeks later. I've tried taking notes on whatever I'm looking up(doesn't work at all), reading the result or article multiple times (better but not great also its time consuming and I end up at greater risk of falling into a clickhole), immediately talking about it with whoever is in the room with me (this one tends to work okayish but there's not always someone around and they're not always interested).I'm 30 so I have a weird relationship with technology",1635181208,1125,209

Admittedly the meds take her spirit away (she feels it and we see it) and that kills all of us to watch so we are ok if she doesn’t take them all the time, but she is struggling.  suggested seeing a new therapist. he didn’t like the one and only one she went to originally.

ADHD,"This was kind if mind blowing for me but it helped me understand myself better. One of the causes of ADHD symptoms is our lack of dopamine. This is different that lack of serotonin. Essentially, dopamine is the chemical in our brain that tells us ""do that again."" Not nessesarily a chemical that makes up happy.  example, if I take a bite of something steeped in sugar, my brain goes ""oh do that again!"" Even I'm kind of underwhelmed with the actual flavor. In theese circumstances its pretty easy to go ""nah, not worth the chewing effort"" something like beer unfortunately is pretty easy to just.... do again. The first beer feels great, so I have another. The second beer didn't make me feel better, but my brain is stuck on the first one giving me dopeamine. ""Do it again!"" o you can be standing there, not feeling great, but feeling impelled to have another beer. Or another mediocre cookie. Or another piece of bacon. But those things might not give you serotonin, they just fulfill a dopeamine response. You can be miserable the entire time, but have an urge to satisfy the dopamine response over and over.  takes alot of self control for me to take a step back and say ""if I eat this I will just feel miserable later. What do I ACTUALLY want right now."" Of course that forever feeling of ""can't figure out what I'm really craving"" is also part of adhd. And even worse, usually what I'm truly craveing usually turns out to be excercise.  But excercise doesn't give me a dopamine response that says ""don't that again!"" o every single day I have to re make myself do it with no dopamine response. No matter how goo it feels to do my brain never says ""do that again!"" But what excercuse does give me is a satisfied feeling. Endorphins. erotonin. o wouldn't it be great of I craved it? Very annoying. It's like all the tools are there but work backwards.Things can trigger a dopeamine response that aren't nessesarily things we like",1635178841,1934,349

ADHD,"Hi friends!I just wanted to share my experience trying to get a diagnosis through Circle Medical, and see if anyone has a different one! had found the company/app doing a Google search of ""ADHD diagnosis NYC."" I know, I know, too easy to be good. But it seemed to be really promising - the website made it clear that they were able to diagnose ADHD in individuals who suspected they might have it but never have had a diagnosis....which is me. I even found some other Reddit threads about people's experience, it seemed mostly positive so I decided to give it a go.  first appointment was with a primary care provider and it seemed to mostly consist of normal intake questions and a few screening questions for ADHD but mostly just felt like a primary care appointment. In my second appointment I was actually told that... They can not actually diagnose ADHD because the providers are not qualified to diagnose ADHD.... They are more geared towards people who have had a previous diagnosis or who need long-term support.  she told me they have one in-house psychiatrist only. The primary care providers consult with him, and then I think you might be able to be on boarded for a diagnosis if you need long term support. It still makes no sense to me and I still think that I must completely misinterpreting the entire situation.  had indicated that I wasn't sure I wanted medicine, and I just wanted a diagnosis for my own knowledge, so I'm wondering if maybe I just didn't fit the bill since I wouldn't be continuing to come back to them and give them my business? o maybe, long term support means continued business and appointments? reasoning just didn't seem to make any sense and seems to contradict the entire business model so I'm wondering if I misunderstood the business model or if I simply just wasn't a good candidate. It just seems weird that the appointment I made was specifically an ADHD diagnosis appointment, and then I was told that she can not diagnose it....I should also clarify that I was never told I wasn't a good candidate, it was more of a general, ""we don't do this"" statement. the doctor in my second appointment told me that she was going to waive the cost of the second appointment, so that's good at least, although I still wasted $120 on the first appointment! just left feeling a little bit stumped. Also a little pissed off.... also a little pissed off at myself for falling for an Google ad for a silicon valley app claiming to be able to make ADHD diagnoses, lol.

ADHD,"Hi,  (28F) been coming to the realization that I may have ADHD. I've always struggled throughout life when it comes to keeping focus and following through with things.

Currently I'm on wellbutrin which should help with my focus and im taking vitamins since I'm very lacking and I was advised that lack of proper nutrition also could be a cause of my depression, anxiety, and fatigue.  though I've been talking to professionals and have a plan on how to get better... I still feel like an imposter? I feel like there's nothing wrong with me and I'm just looking for excuses to be late, mess up at work and home, be messy, etc. And my friend doesn't help either. he's been diagnosed with severe OCD and has been working on it for years. We've known each other since we were children and when she started developing symptoms of OCD she would call me for comfort and I would be there for her. I was always a stable rock for her and she always tells me she wishes she had my issues because it's better than her condition. Her condition caused her to lose jobs and it seemed like I was successful because I've had no issues in my career and earn a decent living. The thing is I'm the type to suffer in silence. I've tried to open up with her but she always says ""oh everyone feels that way it's normal"" or ""have you spoken to someone else for a second opinion "" and it has made me feel 2x the imposter that I usually do.

ADHD,"I'm not planning to go to prison. But I was thinking, given how much I hate the monotony in normal everyday life as a college student, I would go absolutely insane in prison. Given that ADHD has been positively associated with both minor and serious offenses, it seems so screwed up that prison recklessly leaves people to be consumed by their thoughts. Everybody talks about how prisons don't rehabilitate, they just make criminals worse, but I've never seen this angle looked at. I'm not saying prison should be a party, but is it not wildly fucked up that prisoners with ADHD are put through what is probably mental torture?

ADHD,"Hi friends!Let me preface this by saying I have never made an effort to call out a company on B (maybe that's a bad thing), but I just wanted to share my experience trying to get a diagnosis through Circle Medical. had found the company/app doing a Google search of ""ADHD diagnosis NYC."" I know, I know, too easy to be good. But it seemed to be really promising - the website made it clear that they were able to diagnose ADHD in individuals who suspected they might have it but never have had a diagnosis....which is me. I even found some other Reddit threads about people's experience, it seemed mostly positive so I decided to give it a go.  first appointment was with a primary care provider and it seemed to mostly consist of normal intake questions and a few screening questions for ADHD but mostly just felt like a primary care appointment. In my second appointment I was actually told that... They can not actually diagnose ADHD because the providers are not qualified to diagnose ADHD.... They are more geared towards people who have had a previous diagnosis or who need long-term support. (Despite the website saying otherwise) she told me they have one in-house psychiatrist only. The primary care providers consult with him, and then I think you might be able to be on boarded for a diagnosis if you need long term support. It still makes no sense to me and I still think that I must completely misinterpreting the entire situation.  had indicated that I wasn't sure I wanted medicine, and I just wanted a diagnosis for my own knowledge, so I'm wondering if maybe I just didn't fit the bill since I wouldn't be continuing to come back to them and give them my business? o maybe, long term support means continued business and appointments? reasoning just didn't seem to make any sense and seems to contradict the entire business model so I'm wondering if I misunderstood the business model or if I simply just wasn't a good candidate. It just seems weird that the appointment I made was specifically an ADHD diagnosis appointment, and then I was told that she can not diagnose it....I should also clarify that I was never told I wasn't a good candidate, it was more of a general, ""we don't do this"" statement. the doctor in my second appointment told me that she was going to waive the cost of the second appointment, so that's good at least, although I still wasted $120 on the first appointment! just left feeling a little bit stumped. Also a little pissed off.... also a little pissed off at myself for falling for an bad for a silicon valley app claiming to be able to make ADHD diagnoses, lol. There were other weird things with the app, namely the chat feature wasn't very efficient, but I was willing to overlook that. I guess I'm wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience, or what I may be missing. The doctor said she was new to Circle, so I'm wondering too if maybe the misunderstanding was on her end. if anyone else has found an actual affordable option for a first time diagnosis, I would love to learn about it! had a very weird experience with Circle Medical, was told they don't actually do ADHD diagnosis.Experience with Circle Medical",1635176269,3176,567

ADHD,"  my personal experience with vyvanse: a 21 year old male who has been on vyvanse since i was 17 years old. when i first got started on the meds, i was put on 20 mg of it and 5 mg of adderall (i think? i can't remember but it seemed like a low dose). i found that i hated adderall as it gave me awful insomnia, so i ended my treatment with adderall and soon began taking 30 mg of vyvanse alone for the next few years. aside from the typical side effects (reduced appetite, higher anxiety, etc.) i was relatively fine overall. around this time last year, i noticed that the effects began to feel a bit less \*effective\*, to which i told my psychiatrist. he then prescribed me 40 mg, which despite my weight and height being relatively the same since i had first started the meds, felt fine at first. about two days in began the insomnia, which was accompanied by days where i would not eat at all, and i later noticed even more dire side effects. first off, i know it's listed as a ""rare"" side effect, but i noticed my hair both changing textures and begin thinning over the next few months. alongside this, i should note that i have zero genetic disposition to male pattern baldness, and that the thinning itself did not follow the typical MPB patterns, but rather has just become thin all over. i also know for a fact that this is medicine-induced because i do not take my vyvanse during the summers, and in the three months i was off it, i noticed my hair slowly returning and not falling out at all really (in an alarming way). also noticed myself becoming more obsessive and compulsive over sexual desires, and huge mood swings. prior to my change in dosage, none of this was really the case. now, a year later after having my dosage changed, it is clearly apparent. i recently talked to my psychiatrist about moving me back down to 30 mg. alongside that, I've made a plan to taper off and eventually stop using vyvanse altogether. i wanted to ask you all, however, is if anyone has experienced anything similar when given a dosage that it too high over a long period of time? it's really begun to affect the way i both view myself and my relationships, and it's become less of a crutch and more of a curse.noticing more extreme side effects on vyvanse from a dose that's too high",1635174653,2285,425

How soon into your Methylphenidate, Concerta, Ritalin, or Foquest treatment did it show up?** of Background: used to be on Vyvanse 40 mg then was switched to Foquest 85 mg (12 - 16 hr extended Methylphenidate release) with a Concerta 18 mg booster around noon. This change was made about a year and a half ago. a month after titrating up to Foquest 85 mg, I started to get upper back pain out of nowhere. Concerta 18 mg was added about 10 months ago to improve concentration. done a lot to treat my back (massage, physio, chiro, medication, physical rehab and general exercise, ergo optimization, etc) but I can't seem to really heal it up. I suspect it's the Methylphenidate, however, when my doctor reduces my dose I tend to be more sensitive to the pain. My family doctor figures it's just muscle tension and the specialist who prescribes the ADHD meds thinks it's not related to the medication. X-rays show nothing remarkable.

On the other hand, some days it makes me terribly agitated, it's like my body's motor accelerates like crazy, and while I still feel more in control and can do basic stuff like eating when it's time to eat, this agitation stops me from any productive task; it's like I'm freaking out so bad that I can't get out of my own head.

ADHD,"I’m going to try and keep this short, I’m just trying to figure out my current mental state and of anyone can relate.  a 30m always new I had adhd but was only just diagnosed formally and began medication. I’m on 20mg adderall xr am and 10mgs of the same at 12pm.  up I had the typical symptoms such as racing thoughts and hyperfixating on certain situations or trains of thought. I was successful about 8yrs ago in blocking out almost all inner monologue, I was capable of them but I had to want to have them. This lead to all sorts of unforeseen problems and my inattention was just as bad if not worse. When these thoughts may have broken through whatever barrier I had I would also be able to turn them and my emotions off (trauma response). I grew used to this anf while not the healthiest it served a purpose.  since coming closer to the right dosage my outside life is getting better but these thought processes are returning and I feel like I’ve lost my “switch.”  going through a really rough time right now emotionally, that is unrelated to the medication. It started before I even got diagnosed. I try to think clearly about the situation and how to and if I should move forward in a relationship. Every time I do this I get really caught in really negative thoughts that aren’t fully based in reality or they’re a mix between justified and irrational. For example my wife and I got evicted partially my fault for assuming the money was coming out of an account that had the money in it I never touched and then selling the apartment complex without informing us of it and never telling me they weren’t receiving rent, and her refusing to work. Now we split physically but aren’t really separated though we both went to our respective parents house. he doesn’t get along with her family and is now looking to moving into a studio with her and her child. I’m understanding why she wants to but I’m furious and heartbroken that she decides to get a job after begging her for a couple years. While I can’t afford it because I’m still flipping the bills phone, insurances, things like that and staying at my parents with my child trying to save up and fix everything that happened so we could move out again.  have so many different emotions, everything embarrassment, guilt, shame, jealousy, self hate, apathy, and my coping skill no longer existed. I don’t even know where to start. Yes I’m in therapy but that doesn’t seem to be helping a whole lot. I apologize for unloading here so if you made it this far thank you.

Now ive always been a pretty timid kid when it comes to talking to my parents about mental health but i finally worked up the corage to tell them about it and i went to talk to a Neurophycologist who suggested further diagnosis of ADHD from there i went to a phycologist who gave me an outline of who to talk to (my GP) in order to meet with a phyciatrist, after booking with the GP i found out bad news, the city im in has no specialists for adult ADHD meaning that if i am ever going to be diagnosed it would have to be in the next 9 is months he sent out an email asking when there was a spot avalible for someone to talk to about it. just today i found out the next appointment is in 10 months. im lowkey freaking out a little about this becasu now i feel like an absolute fool for waiting so long to tell my parents when now it could all be for nothing. i already feel embarassed asking to talk to someone about potential for ADHD because i feel like im too old to have it, all my friedns with ADHD got diagnosed when they were way younger and now im worried that im just too late to get help.

I was going out and doing a lot, and finally being as social as I've wanted to be (bad social anxiety, basically nothing changed for me when quarantine started, for example). till, I'd been really struggling to keep up with my classwork, and was just barely keeping pace with it. I can definitely feel depression trying to worm back in to my life, and it's been hard to avoid getting discouraged at every turn.  little over a week ago, my grandfather passed pretty suddenly. I lived with him before moving back on campus. I hadn't really been attached to him since about middle school (he has a really toxic personality and doesn't respect boundaries at all, among other things). He was in his 80s and was having issues with heart failure. till, his actual death was sudden, and I went back home asap to be with the rest of my family. I wasn't the most heartbroken. I said goodbye knowing that I may not see him for months and that he may not have had months, and I won't lie and say that I miss having him around now that I'm living at my uni's campus. till, it was rough and  I wanted to be with my family (although mostly for my grandmother).

ADHD,"orry this is so long, but I've been struggling and I don't know what to do. o basically whenever I need to study or do homework, I pretty much HAVE to take an ADHD pill (I'm on Vyvanse rn but I've tried Ritalin and Concerta and I didn't like either) or else I'm just gonna procrastinate and never get any work done. However, when I take a pill, I just get anxious, nervous, stressed, etc. and I keep stressing over the amount of work I need to finish and all the things in my future (like tests and university and future hardships) and I get depressed and quiet and unhappy. I also don't take breaks, study till late at night and don't enjoy myself after a long day (like I don't feel like doing anything like playing games or even watching Netflix). much rather not take pill and not be depressed, but I can't concentrate without it. Are there any tips for studying without taking pill, or if not, are there any tips for me to lessen my 'dull mood' and anxious thoughts? advice would be appreciated, I'm in my last year of school and I feel like I just can't continue. Please help 🙏 😢 😭How can I study without pill?",1635161416,1116,212

Me and my partner are searching for an apartment to buy and there is an exeptionally cute one we are going to have a look at. ince I discovered it I can't get it out of my head. It's different from other hyperfixations like hobbies (aqauriums, stocks... etc) because it's an object and so real. I'm thinking about it all day, I daydream about painting the walls, aranging furniture, just living there. It overshadows every other thing thats going on in my life right now, so unhealthy. I also just can't see the downsides. When we would'nt be able to buy it I would be madly dissapointed, like crashed...

ADHD,"*""It's the hope that kills you""* been lurking on here for a few months and this subred has been a huge source of support for me! eeing stories from people who seem to be dealing with the same issues (and laughing about it too!) and encouraging and congratulating each other. It's a long way from the image of Reddit that I had before finding it, where it always sounded like a really snarky place. had never considered the possibility that I might have ADHD, but it was always motivation, or just ""needing to be super organized otherwise nothing gets done"" or ""changing jobs frequently because I'm a free spirit"" or ""being a bit of a dreamer"" or ""getting very focused on something (probably not what I should be focused on"" or ""always kind of half working, never really working, never really relaxing"".  was just... me. But, as many of you have said, it just became so tiring as the years went by, for me and for those around me. I started to wonder what was going on.  I read a description of someone with inattentive adhd I just ***knew***. ure, I denied it for a while, but I've gone from being horrified at the idea that there might be something wrong with me to praying that there is clearly identifiable for which I can get help. waiting to see a psychiatrist to start the diagnosis process. I'm counting down the weeks and picturing how it will go: the psychiatrist will say ""of course you've got it, let's get you the help you need"" and my life will change for the better - with hard work, yes, but it's not like I'm not working hard now. what if it doesn't work out like that? What if I don't get diagnosed? What if there's nothing wrong with me. What if this is just me? I'm worrying about this far more than I should, and I still have 2 months to wait... feel really lonely with this, and excited that things might get better, but worried that it might not be that simple, or that I might have to start this whole waiting process all over again. for the huge block of text, wishing you all well.The interminable and stressful wait for diagnosis",1635160261,2055,380

ADHD,"At the age of 17 my Dad took me to the mental hospital as I was feeling suicidal after a girl broke my heart. The doctor there was testing everyone for ADHD so he could prescribe Ritalin. They discovered that I had a bad case of ADHD (which I do) and prescribed me Ritalin even though he knew I was addicted to ecstasy. It was love at first site. You take the Ritalin and in exactly one hour it kicks in and the euphoria and rush that goes on for hours, the thrill of waiting for it to kick in. I loved it. The Ritalin also strongly enhanced a total of four other addictions that conquered me making them even more pleasurable, one of them being sexual. I would take the whole monthly supply within 7 days and do nothing but pleasure myself with a total of 5 different addictions, no sleep at all. It was paradise. The pleasure was so extreme that I don’t see how I could have ever resisted the Ritalin’s power. It got me higher than any street drug that is out there. I now have no soul. No life in me. No personality. I am 31 and haven’t dated since I was 17 the year it was prescribed too me. God also shut the door on me because the Ritalin also made me read the Bible too much and once you know the Bible so well God only gives you so much time to repent and it wasn’t possible to resist the Ritalin. Ive lost everything. I committed so much sin while on Ritalin and I have to pay for every last bit.

Basic things like putting trash in the correct bin, or turning lights off when they leave.10. When you talk to them, they don't actually appear to be listening or even iterate that they understand what is being asked. If someone comes into the room to speak to them and they are on their phone, they wont put the phone away ect. obviously some of this stuff doesn't effect me, but the hyperactive stuff with the noise does.

ADHD,"TL,DR: Vyvanse helps my mood and emotional regulation a lot, but does nothing for my focus or executive dysfunction years ago I finally admitted to myself that my way of going through life isn't normal, and that my daily struggle cannot be cured with self-help books. At 29 I was finally diagnosed with ADHD-PI and now I just finished my year of insurance-covered individual + group therapy (mostly CBT). went through a long titration period to find the right kind of meds, as I struggled not only with focus and motivation but also mood swings and low energy. Ritalin just made me incredibly tired after 3 hours, Concerta made me anxious, irritable and depressed and it felt impossible to sleep on it, dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine in the U) finally made me feel happier and more motivated, but also came with the most horrible midday and evening crashes. I finally settled on Vyvanse 30mg, with an increase to 50mg for the week before my period. My PM is debilitating, to the point that my therapist would call it PMDD, which unfortunately is not an official diagnosis in my country.  magically helps me with the catastrophizing and negative thought spirals. However, it has been 5 months that I am struggling to apply for jobs, and no matter which 'tricks' I try to employ (focus mate, scheduling, breaking up tasks in smaller steps, having someone hold me semi accountable etc) I always lose my drive after a few days and can't seem to keep myself productive. I should be working on my portfolio (something I actually enjoy) but instead I just manically browse inspirational design blogs. I should be writing motivational letters, but instead I just stare at my screen.  Vyvanse working just for one aspect of life mean it's not the right medication? Adderall is not available here and I made the mistake to tell my doctor Vyvanse is helping me, because I was scared of going back to the suicidal thoughts and anxiety I experienced before starting it.Vyvanse working, but not the way it's supposed to - please help",1635159461,2017,347

Maybe I need a deadline for myself instead of leaving it open ended. But it just kills me because I know this task would take me like an hour tops.

ADHD,"I'm in a spiral of sorts. I found this community today because I just wanted to see first hand experiences but I thought while I'm here I'd share mine. I'm 28F, all my life my mum I guess was telling me I had ADHD but she never told me ""you have it. We had you diagnosed"" so I thought this whole time she was just discussing suspicions based on my behaviour and how it was comparable to family members who also had ADHD.  got pregnant last year and she was telling my family history stuff that might be important to my future child and she mentioned me having ADHD, I said to her that it wasn't confirmed though and she just suspected I had it. To which she told me directly for the first time ever that I was officially diagnosed as a child considering the timeframe I'm remembering I was having an issue with writing and I was about 6-7 years old when that was a problem. That's when I was diagnosed apparently. pushed this information to the side because I was pregnant and figured hey I've been living like this for years, this changes nothing.  yeah needless to say it's been causing issues which have become more obvious since I became a mother. Nothing damaging to my child just having trouble keeping on top of everything and a bit worse a time self regulating my emotions. I'm pretty prone to anxiety and negative self talk. lead me to spiral and start talking to professionals, my psych is going to do what she can for me and my partner talked to his psych and came home with a form for me to complete that's like the first part of some kind of diagnostic tool to help flag if I've got it and all the psych could say in response to my scores was just ""wow"" (scored quite high) and now I'm trying to find records of my initial diagnosis to get the ball rolling again but it takes time to process that and i still haven't submitted paper work. I've just been sort of researching in the meantime, trying to make sense of things and taking stock of how different things could have been if I had got the help I needed when I was a kid I might have done a bit better socially or academically, I might have achieved more or done more. Or if not that maybe just been a bit less stressed and lost.  just a lot to process and I guess it changes nothing, knowing I had this wouldn't make it go away but realising there's a reason for why I am the way I am and that I'm not just a bundle of character flaws is a lot to take in. Plus I still have a kid to take care of so I'm doing all my self reflection in the shower and the toilet because outside of those moments I'm a mother first and foremost and that takes priority.  hope I belong here even with a diagnosis that is really old that I've just been made aware of.Probably should have been directly told sooner",1635156701,2762,531

I’ve gone my entire life believing I am lazy, unmotivated, unlikable.  family never understood me growing up and would get frustrated with my perceived incompetence.. this caused me to feel angry and at such a young age I didn’t understand why I had a chip on my shoulder.

I do too.  partner often gets frustrated with me for doing “selfish” things. I genuinely never realize this will offend him until after which frustrates him more. He feels like the fact that I don’t think of him proves that I’m selfish.  example, if something is bothering me I bring it up right away because at the time it feels like I have to, only to cause an argument because of how I deliver it or it being an inopportune time. I understand but I can’t seem to learn not to do this. I just get overwhelmed and have to resolve it right away.  will hear him explain my selfishness to me and I immediately understand. Like, I did eat his burrito.. I didn’t think he’d care for whatever reason or didn’t think cause it was just in our fridge and we share food. And many other things like that.

I’ve always had a hard time getting up/hearing my alarms/getting to sleep on time since i was a child but in August, i started sleeping through 10-20 alarms and would stay up for days at a time, i also slept like a dead person. I talked to my doctor and she said i was probably just adjusting still. But It continued and i have at least 3-5 nights a month where i don’t sleep at all - not all in a row but sometimes 2 days at a time. Because I work full time and the anxiety of falling asleep to potentially sleep through work is very exhausting, I tend to get into bed around 10 pm but can’t even begin to think of falling asleep until 2-3 am, but even by then i’m not even tired. I take my medication before 11 each day and still have terrible terrible sleep patterns.  the other hand, I have found taking my medication before I go to sleep (around 3-5 am usually lol) actually helps relax me and helps me with the anxiety of not waking up. I wake up on the first alarm and jump out of bed ready to start my day, but obviously with minimal sleep (around 4-6 hrs), that “euphoric” morning feeling is very short lived and by 3 pm i’m exhausted and feel like i’m ready for bed.  took my medication at 5:30 am last night , crashed early and got into bed at 9 but now i’m not even tired and it’s nearly 4;30 am again.  sure if i’m looking for advice or hoping someone relates but it’s extremely exhausting that even the medication that is supposed to improve my lifestyle is actually just making it worse?vyvanse insomnia is really getting to me",1635153481,1716,333

ADHD,"**Objective:** To determine whether iron deficiency in infancy is associated with sluggish cognitive tempo (CT) or attention-deficit/hyperactive-impulsive (AD-HI) symptoms in childhood and adolescence, and whether such behaviors contribute concurrently and predictively to lower verbal and mathematical abilities. Chilean children (*N* = 959; 50% male, of panish or indigenous descent from working-class backgrounds) were rated by mothers for CT or AD-HI symptoms at ages 5, 10, and 16 years. Children completed standardized tests assessing verbal and mathematical abilities at ages 5, 10, and 16. At ages 12 and 18 months, children were assessed for iron deficiency. Adjusting for a comprehensive panel of covariates, greater severity of iron deficiency in infancy was associated with more frequent CT and AD-HI symptoms at all ages studied. Most effects of iron deficiency on children's verbal and math skills were indirect, mediated through AD-HI behaviors. Children's AD-HI symptoms related to lower verbal and math test scores within age and across age. The long-term associations found between infant iron deficiency and CT and AD-HI behaviors suggest that the neurodevelopmental alterations that stem from postnatal iron deficiency might play an etiological role in the development of ADHD. creening for early-life nutritional deficiencies among children with CT or ADHD symptoms might prove useful, and behavioral screening of children with a history of iron deficiency seems warranted. Interventions that support brain development after early nutritional deprivation also would be beneficialIron Deficiency in Infancy and Sluggish Cognitive Tempo and ADHD Symptoms in Childhood and Adolescence",1635152247,1702,244

ADHD,"I really do get the NH is stretched but it’s such a shame that the process for getting assessed and treated in this country is so convoluted. Even after a consultant psychiatrist that does both NH &amp; private work carried out an assessment over multiple sessions that led to a diagnosis, my GP was straight in there with the road blocks when it came time to prescribing medication. I’ve ended up having to get it prescribed privately and it costs a lot to do so. I will say is if you’re in a position to go private, I would highly recommend it. Find a GMC registered psychiatry consultant that specialises in ADHD. Truth is even I was on the fence about how real ADHD was but after a year on medication, I’m 100% convinced it is an actual disease. I was unwell for for the as long as I can remember, started treatment (vyvanse 60mg) and now I’m getting better.

Don’t just turn up on the day either, I’d suggest preparing beforehand. I wrote down all the reasons why I thought I had ADHD as well as why I felt I might not. My partner also had to fill out a questionnaire - I got her to do it when I was out and she mailed it to the clinic herself.

ADHD,"I wrote this in relation to another post that might be dead by now, about last minute working, and I think I really need to talk about this, so I figured I would just start a new thread.  really hope I didn't have to rely on that last minute rush to get anything done...  I'm 26, went back to college last year and I still can't do anything until the last minute. Everything I do I eaither start or finish the biggest part of the work the night before. I'm training to be a primary teacher and I'm in front of students one day a week since the school year started, and I think that it's what made my suspected ADHD become way worse (and actually had me looking for the reasons behind my struggles). got much more responsibilities than last year. I have to prep the classes, which takes me most of my time and energy since I don't want to fuck up and be a bad teacher for the students, and on top of that I still have to turn in things, be evaluated, and I have to write a thesis that I barely started by the middle/end of the current school year. I'm just completely stressed every single day. Even if it's not the full blown anxiety, it's like it's always fuming somewhere in the background. I just almost can never really relax and enjoy the moment. The only time I can ignore that is when I'm playing guitar or drums, as music is the main thing that allows me not completely lose my shit, along with going to the gym and working out intensely. But even then I'll sometimes have this reminder that ""OMG I NEED TO DO THI AND THAT"". i'm not anxious about the classes I have to prep, I'm anxious about the deadlines I need to meet for my master's degree, or about making progress on some school related work before I go back to the lesson in which I have to present it at the end, or my thesis. And if I'm not anxious about that, I'll just get anxious about the silliest thing, like making time to go groceriy shopping, to wash my hair. It's often related to time managment actually. I'm at the point where I'm afraid to watch at a clock and hide the time on my phone because I don't wan't to see how much ""behind"" I'm on my schedule. Even while i'm writing that, I'm worried about the fact that I have to start studying for a mock exam that we have on Wednesday... been living in complete anxiety ever since this new school year started in september, and I just don't see myself going on like that. I don't want to, I know the effect that tress can have on the mind and the body and I don't want that. I'm getting pains that I believe are related to the anxiety. I'm just so afraid that I'll break down along the way and end up disappointing my family, the people I'm close with and even some of my teachers. got so bad this year that for the first time in my life I actually made some research in order to see a psychiatrist or therapist.

ADHD,"o due to a recent meltdown I started to see a psychologist to try and straighten my thoughts out during a really bad bout of depression. he tried an ADHD screening questionnaire and surprisingly a bunch of the questions really accurately described some really counterproductive patterns of behaviour I’ve had as far back as I can remember. I ended up getting a referral to a psychiatrist and we're partway through the diagnostic process now. I was a kid, I’ve always had a laser like focus where I can work on or research something nonstop for hours or days on end… the only issue is I have no control over what my brain decides to devote every last one off its neurons towards, and I certainly can’t switch it on (or even off) at will. Because of this I never really considered ADHD, but after reading more I feel like this is a pretty common experience. I’m in the process of filling out a bunch of questionnaires and tracking down school report cards and I can’t help but feel I’m “gaming” the system. I feel like maybe I’m just stubborn and lazy, like anyone could write down a bunch of examples for the AR if they wanted to and all I'm lacking is willpower/discipline. I made the mistake of reading up as much as I could about ADHD before the appointment, so I know all the diagnostic criteria and I catch myself adding up scores to see how positive I screen. I want a neat little answer that explains my lifelong pattern of negative behaviours and I feel like I’m subconsciously exaggerating things that might be totally normal. Initially I was so sure about ADHD, but now I’m worried that I’m subconsciously “trying” to get a diagnosis because I just want an answer. To be frank I do want the diagnosis since I feel it describes a lot of the problem's I've been dealing with since primary school, and I feel like this is influencing my answers on the questionnaires. Has anyone else diagnosed later in life been through something similar to this or am I just going crazy overthinking things? more background for those interested or if someone like me is fervently googling the same issue at some point in the future: of my focus issues I’ve always felt like the direction my life takes is almost entirely out of my hands. How well I do with studies/hobbies or even if I pay my bills before threats to cut my power start to arrive is completely dependent on if I get a deadline-induced sudden surge of motivation/mental clarity and become the most productive person in all of existence for a day or two. I’ve failed out of two undergraduate degrees and managed to complete my third attempt with good grades, but after spending 5 years on postgraduate research the novelty’s totally worn off and it almost feels like my brain shuts down when I try write the damn thesis.  I’m really “in the zone” I can latch onto a thought and there’s a thread that I follow where each idea leads onto something else that effortlessly forms a coherent argument or fleshed out idea, I’ll even get an endorphin-y buzz when I’m totally engrossed in something new and interesting. If I’m not interested in something, following those threads quickly just leads to an empty space and that train of thought comes to an abrupt end and I get stuck in a really frustrating loop of trying to start a coherent thought.

ADHD,"A meme:    &gt;""I slept for fifteen hours last night.""   you must be well rested, right?""*          Depression naps hit all the right notes for me.     1.

Nothing triggers that whole ""I'm useless and wasting my life"" feeling better than sleeping for three quarters of a day.    I think the worst part, for me, are the dreams.

ADHD,"Hello everyone, 21 [F] here with ADHD combined type. I've been diagnosed for over 2 years, but recently started medication (couple months ago) I am also a full time student, and my medication helps me so much. Going on medication was the best decision of my life. the other hand, I sort of realized an issue I have, and the medication doesn't seem to help it. I'm not too sure if it is just an ADHD thing, i'm just an impulsive person, or if it's because I overthink way too much with jobs. I just, can't seem to find my place in the workfield. Now, I think the main issue might be they're just minimum wage jobs, since those are the only jobs I have worked (they can be really boring and repetitive) my current job (I started about a month ago) is super repetitive, boring, coworkers don't talk to me (due to the fact they're basically off before I'm there), environment is toxic, and I always end up closing alone and have a heavy workload. These are all great reasons to be unhappy with a job, but I have job hopped quite a lot and I don't seem to stop. I did, however work for a company that I really enjoyed (it was a total of about 4 years) I ended up leaving last month because of personal reasons. It seems like I'm better suited for a job that doesn't have consistent tasks (do this, follow the list, get these 10 things done) compared to a job that is hands on and busy (go take care of the rush etc) I'm now planning to just focus on my school and not work for awhile (or as much) and just stick to volunteer work as well.

ADHD,"I applied for a job I am definitely qualified for two months late, despite starting the application a month early to try and combat my symptoms. Of course, I had trouble focusing, gave up day after day due to feeling overwhelmed, got hopeless as weeks went by and I just couldn't finish...Finally, I pushed through. I quadruple checked the application and submit it. After I submit it, I checked through everything again (pointless, I know, but alas). Naturally, I noticed AFTER I submit that I made two careless mistakes. I was desperate to get things done, I misread directions and messed up something that should be easy. so many months agonizing over this just to screw up on something so simple (classic ADHD mistake) makes me feel so sad. I feel like I've wasted the time of my friends and partner who supported me. I'm worried that I'll be suffering through another round of job applications because I basically turned down a renewal offer at my current job to apply for this one. know that I'm at odds because I have ADHD, and I should be gentle with myself, but it really does feel like I'm sabotaging myself. I can't email the recruiter and say ""haha sorry I have executive dysfunction so of course I missed two questions!""

ADHD,"so it’s my birthday today. I have been dreading it since the start of the month, even before. It’s not the first time I get this feeling. think it may be caused by the way adhd affects my socializing. It also happens to fall on a work day which stresses me out even more, because after work I just go home to my pets and don’t like to socialize as my work environment pretty much drains me.  social circle keeps getting smaller over the years, and my birthday is a good day for me to hyper focus on that. I think so far, this year I’ve received the least amount of birthday wishes, and I definitely can’t blame people for not recognizing my adhd and my inability to keep the communication lines open constantly. The only friends i have left are the ones who are fine with picking up when we left off no matter how many days or even months pass without us talking. some point of my life, especially in college, my birthday was this happy occasion for me, but nowadays it’s only a reminder that i’m falling behind in almost every aspect of my life. I hate my job, but I can’t afford to leave it as i am the breadwinner of my family (sibling and pets), and I handle all the financial responsibilities. a few days ago i got a pretty stern warning from my boss about taking days off. guess this is all just a rant, but i’m curious to know if anyone else feels this way? And if so, how do you make yourself feel better? I want to feel good at least on this day. It doesn’t help that it happens to be on a Monday this year either, lol would just like to hear your experiences and even rants, I guess this is more of a seeking empathy post than anything else, and i thought this would be a good community to have this conversation with since I really can’t share these thoughts with anyone else.birthday blues?",1635142397,1802,345
ADHD,"I wrote on here last week about experiencing a weird head fog and issues with memory recall with vyvanse. ince I stopped taking it, I haven’t experienced any symptoms. However, I went back to my absent-minded, space cadet, rambling blabber mouth mcgee self. My psychiatrist then prescribed me Adderall xr which I’ve been taking for probably four days now. It’s only 20mg, and it’s only supposed to last for four hours, but I have only been sleeping two hours a night. I have all this energy. Here’s the problem: I am also diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder and Borderline Personality Disorder, and from time to time, I slip into psychotic delusions. These are fairly common as Bipolar runs in my family, but it’s been about 5 years since I’ve experienced a psychotic delusion/ episode. I rarely experience them, but I know my other family members with Bipolar experience them more often. I mostly have issues with the BPD symptoms. Idk what happened. Idk if it’s triggering me into an episode - stimulants plus no sleep - or if it’s just releasing too much serotonin into my brain, but I am seriously becoming delusional ever since I started taking Adderall Xr. I’m worried, one, I don’t have health insurance, and I cannot afford a trip to the hospital, even if my mental health demands it. Two, 50% of the people with Bipolar in my family have killed themselves being in psychotic episodes. I am terribly concerned. I’m obviously going to stop taking it and notify my therapist tomorrow morning, but I’m just so worried I won’t recover since I’m already getting close to that state of mind, and I’ll be forced to get in-patient treatment at a facility, drop out of grad school, and be in serious debt from medical bills. I’ve done so many self-care rituals to try and help me, but I am still feeling my mind slip away. Has anyone else with comorbidity experienced this before? Are there coping mechanisms out there for ADHD’s who choose not to take medication? I’m only used to my BPD coping mechanisms.

ADHD,"It's currently 2 am for me, so I'm sorry about mistakes if I make them. I'm sorry if this doesn't belong here or if I break any rules, and if you read this thank you :) am currently in high school, and it doesn't seem worth the effort anymore. I'm supposedly a pretty smart kid, but of course my adhd (I was diagnosed when I was around 7 or so, and still am showing a lot of the symptoms for it, which I believe counts but if I'm wrong please call me out on that) interferes. since the beginning of middle school, my performance in school has gradually gotten worse. During middle school I'd always end up doing well enough overall at the end of the year, and I've done respectable work to the point where colleges and things have already reached out to me. Ever since high school began, however, I've found focusing to be so much harder than before, and I've barely made it through final exams and end of course tests. I know it's a really bad thing to do, but I tend to cheat on certain assignments sometimes because I can't focus well enough to understand the information, and anytime I've managed or tried to it has backfired anyway. I feel like there's no way that I'll do well enough to pass in the end, this year or if I continue, because I'm already really behind in some classes and I've learned next to nothing in any of them, and I feel that if I continue this way, school will become more and more pointless. parents are set on me going to college, and I'm sure that even if I somehow manage to do well in high school, I'll just end up failing or dropping out of college. I've got time before I need to go, but I just can't see myself doing well. anyone have any advice or anything like that to change my mind or help me continue? I'm not entirely sure what I want out of this post to be honest, it's just really early and I decided to make it ig.

I was working in the basement and listening to an audio book through my earbuds when my girlfriend came down to organize some things too. he was playing a video on her phone and the audio that comes out of a cellphone speaker is truly awful to me.

ADHD,"My dating life has been basically non existent. Mainly due to struggling to keep my sexuality hidden, but also because I have attachment issues on both ends. I've met some pretty nice people over the years, people I honestly think I could have dated if I didn't struggle so much with being consistent. either I am very attached to someone (sometimes to my own detriment, and when I know someone is toxic for me) or I get immediately detached if conversations are no longer stimulating to me. For example, a few years back I got very attached to this one guy I met, but the second he judged me for how I am (mind you I had been trying for a month an a half to get him to hang out with me, even though he kept claiming he wanted to, he just never made the effort), it was like a switch and I never messaged him again. Though in this instance, he probably deserved it. In his case, I think it wasn't just attachment that kept me around for so long, but also the challenge that kept things going.  tried to identify what the struggle was and I boiled it down to this: If someone is new, fun and exciting to me I will be very invested. But realistically no one can be like that 24/7. However, if I start to get bored then I tend to forget to message them back, or I'll forget they exist altogether (a guy I talked to recently told me that we met a few years ago and I literally forgot that we did). I don't struggle with keeping up with friends. Even if I'm doing 5 different things on the side, my brain manages to keep a special place for them so I can keep up with conversations. I figured my problem wasn't so much memory in this case as it was a constant need for other people to keep me interested. Others have pointed out this lack of investment, which has made me feel bad because I don't necessarily mean to be rude or I do actually think they're pretty nice.  My question would be: are attachment issues common for people with ADHD? If so, how do you manage relationships and such if you experience this?

ADHD,"(tldr at end) Background:  About to be 33, male, no kids, 10 years in hospitality including hourly and managerial roles.  13 jobs since working at 16.  Longest tenure at a grocery store for 4 years as a kid, other than that longest job just got fired from was 2.5. summer I saw a psychiatrist due to long lasting focus issues.  Always thought ADHD was a made up affliction for poor parenting until I actually read someone else's point of view that suffers from it and some field experts. doctor in my 1 hour appointment offered to put me through the standard testing measures, but said he was more than confident that in my mannerisms during the appointment, the way I answered the questions, and the troubles I described that I had ADHD. to early 2019, I left a hotel job for being OVER of working 68 hours a week for a 40 hour pay check and was stressed beyond belief and just beat.  I took a job in insurance sales and thought I loved it. was great at it, I was a top 10 sales person within my territory and have always enjoyed speaking to people and engaging with them...I am a talker, so it worked well.  thing I loved was the schedule being monday to friday 9a to 5p and the boss not being on my back about shit, even production for the most part.   forward to current.  I had two down months and I had disclosed (against EVERY person's advice and redditors advice) about being diagnosed and we had made some changes that put the focus on me making calls, servicing new policies I sold, and other small changes.  I ended up with my two worst weeks. married, went to hawaii, came back...got fired.  Had a customer get upset about something and the boss found a compliance violation in my drawer (sensitive information in a locked drawer, should be shredded).  Pulled me in the day I got back from the best 2.5 weeks of my life and terminated.  he was visibly upset.  I was understanding, if caught she could lose her business and she is very successful but still... doctor suggested I go back to hotels because i enjoy the field and I was able to go undiagnosed for so long because the job plays well into my deficits.  I can delegate a lot of the shit I dont want to do, I can move around the property as expected, a lot of the job was numbers based and I love the numbers aspect, and the engaging with employees and guests always is fun too. my wife is about to be a travel nurse and make 3-4x her previous salary which her current salary is about equal to mine.  (I am super stoked for her she's earned it and deserves it).  I am now unemployed searching for jobs but all the jobs end up being the same shit I have been qualified for 6 years (despite being undertitled and able to do the work on a director level) and the same salary for hotels. jobs I want are impossible to land at the salary desired.  I am not doing the 40 hour paycheck for 50+ hours of work again unless the money is right. would any of you do?  I could start a business, I have some funds to do so.

ADHD,"TL;DR - Feeling really down because after getting diagnosed with ADHD when I was 18, after trying Concerta, my doctor puts me on antidepressants and never tries actual ADHD meds again. witched doctors, doctor says I don't have ADHD and puts me on ertraline. Paid for an extremely expensive genetic test that says I am very compatible with ADHD meds, both doctors don't pay attention to this so I guess I just wasted my money. Maybe I don't have ADHD after all and I'm just lazy and stupid. feeling really discouraged and down right now. I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was 18, and ironically, I was quite happy to have learned that I had a disorder. It was because when I was searching it up and looking up other people's experience with ADHD, it was like ""Oh, so what I have is a thing. There's treatments for this, there's other people like me."" And.... I just felt so understood. Of course, I'd rather *not have it at all*, but I'll take what I can get.  this feeling of being understood only lasted so long. My doctor had me take this very expensive genetic test to determine which medications were compatible with me, and found that I was extremely compatible with almost all the ADHD medications. My doctor put me on Concerta, and when it made me incredibly depressed, she put me on antidepressants and never tried other ADHD meds. I was so confused, and I tried telling her that all the antidepressants did was lift up my mood, I still could not function and it was severely affecting my ability to perform academically. After some financial trouble due to the pandemic, I had to stop seeing her. When I finally had enough money again, I decided to find a different doctor.  doctor was way pricier than the one before, so I had high hopes. he had a really good first impression on me too. Except she didn't believe that I had ADHD at all because I told her that I was actually an honor student in elementary. he had me take a test, and the result was that I *did* have ADHD, but she ignored it and put me on ertraline. The only plus side is she's now giving me something for my anxiety, which the previous one ignored, but I'm devastated.  I forcing this ADHD thing after all? Do I really not have it? I just, I can't believe that I don't. I thought *this was it, this is me, this is what I have.* I related so much with all the posts here, and all the memes and yet actual doctors are saying I don't have it. What even was the point of that extremely expensive genetic test? I wish I never paid for it at all. My parents won't even help me find a doctor because this is ""all in my head"" and I should just exercise more and pay attention a little more. do you guys think? Do I not have ADHD after all? I don't know why it's so hard for me to accept that I don't. I guess it's because I thought I finally understood. Now I just don't know what the hell is wrong with me.

At this point teacher and peers around me  thrown into a sudden lockdown during the final few terms of my schooling, staying at home has completely destroyed all sense of motivation and drive to take this seriously, like it feels like these exams dont count at all when in fact myself and everyone around me have been preparing their entire schooling life for these few tests. I genuinley havent been able to sit myself down and try to study and practice questions, instead it feels like every bit of force within me is repelling myself from these tasks and instead seeking out other pointless forms of entertainment. Its a strange feeling as I dont seem to care much when im doing other things but the guilt is starting to grow as the dates draw nearer. I just know that i have to get studying and working but no matter what I know I should be doing, nothing can bring myself to be motivated enough too. incredibly fustrating and im not sure how im going to be able to pull myself together in time. dont take any meds since my diagnosis is not even complete yet, i was going through the process right before the entire state basically shut down which means im also not entitled to any provisions during the exams. Mind the fact that they are several hours long which means writing and working for three hours straight when currently i cant even sit down for 5 minutes :((my exams are in about two weeks yet i cant bring myself to do any kind of work",1635137830,1735,322
ADHD,"I have known I wanted to into academia since college but being undiagnosed and all meant that I didn’t do well in undergrad.  things got better!

I am close to the applications deadline and I have been unable to do anything at all. I literally sit around counting days until I fuck up the one thing I have wanted for last 7 years.  make plans, write to do lists and then watch everything fall apart everyday.

ADHD,"Adult with ADHD recently only diagnosed.  Frustrated and somewhat wish I was diagnosed earlier .  long as I can remember I’ve been a binge drinker ,  larger than life , impulsive , sometimes aggressive .  divorced and remarried , I love to socialise but consistently go from 0-100 . My close friends are used to my impulsive behaviour (but don’t have to live with me I guess) My husband is much more analytic, not perfect but he he is more guarded than I am.  when I drink I have a tendency of not thinking about consequences, other peoples feelings and my feelings of wanting to go go go and party and have a good time might come off to some people as too much. I do it because after  a few drinks I start to feel somewhat normal , and it feels great . But often I don’t know when to stop .. most of the time i feel as if it’s all fun and innocent.  I have been upsetting my husband recently  . I can feel like I am having a great time as usual after a few too many drinks , and getting frustrated at him for not being like me (called his behaviour boring) I don’t mean that. And understand how awful that has made him feel. I just blurt things out because I feel so good and and want everyone to feel the same . And feel very judged.  anyone have similar experiences with impulsive behaviour (especially around alcohol) and negatively impacting your relationship and how to approach ?  of my life I have either felt depressed / unbelievably anxious probably 70% of my whole life . do I feel “normal” and settled in the moment.  the rest is just me wanting to feel good a happy (binge drinking , which is hit and miss with my behaviour) after a big night , I feel like I’ve done something dreadfully awful … embarrassed , (even if I havent done anything wrong) super depressed which lasts for days .. and sometimes have suicidal thoughts .  frustrate my husband , and feel like a drain on our marriage. I just wish I had an even,  stable temperament .. but I never have and probably never will . don’t want to lose my husband , I love him and he is the calm to my storm.  does someone with ADHD get to a happy medium in life without being all or nothing .ADHD binge drinking and upsetting partner",1635137459,2197,419
ADHD,"Hi, I am new here and don't know a lot about ADHD, and I don't take meds, but I was diagnosed when I was a kid. growing up I felt interested in new things to do with my life constantly, so much it prevented me from pursuing anything specific for years. I just graduated and started working in my career field, but I am constantly feeling like maybe this is not me, and fantasizing - specifically getting adrenaline rushes when thinking about other paths &amp; ideas. It's like I get excited thinking about different versions of myself that I could be?  Which feels like it makes it hard to have direction and be happy with where I'm at. Its overwhelming.

First time poster here from ydney, Australia. wanted to share that I’ve been taking trattera (Lilly brand) for a couple of years and have always had an issue with the taste - it makes me gag and I have to hold my breath while taking it and eat as much as possible after swallowing so as to not get any trattera burp (the absolute worst). week I found out my pharmacy can order a generic andoz brand (of my current 80mg dosage, not sure about others) version for a slightly lower price.

ADHD,"o, like many others I only got diagnosed this year at age 28 and am still very early in my journey of working out an effective way to live and manage my ADHD simultaneously. lucky to have found a full time job in admin that pays above the minimum wage (the cost of living is astronomical in my country and city) and gives me the varied daily tasks and sporadic projects I need in order to remain stimulated and actually satisfied with the work I'm doing.However, thanks to the huge amount of tasks and projects that keep getting added to my already-full work schedule I'm constantly juggling and trying to manage...... at the end of my day I find myself so burnt out and exhausted I'm almost physically unable to do anything other than lie down and rest and read/watch something. Even communicating with friends or family feels too exhausting sometimes. feels like everyone else has so much time and energy that I cannot seem to find. It honestly feels like other people have twice the hours in a day and twice the days in a average week than I do. gotten so bad to the point I find myself struggling to find the energy and time to do self-care things like showering, brushing my teeth, washing my face, etc.I feel like a failure of an adult because I can barely cope doing what feels the bare minimum. have talked to both my psychiatrist and psychologist about this, and both have given the same recommendation of reducing the amount of hours I work.I'd love to reduce my hours or drop to part time to try and get things under control... but the cost of living in my city is so bad the resulting drop in my pay would mean my partner and I would not be able to survive.I don't want to quit my job, but I also know I cannot continue like this indefinitely.

Anyway I am seeing about getting tested. What I don't understand however is people still complain about the inattentiveness and poor time management skills even when they take a full simulant regiment with good results, even when they started meds really young?

ADHD,"I've felt the side effects of dexamphetamine have been consistently heavy for me, especially the comedown hitting that's dissuading me from taking the full dose, therefore not receiving nearly as much of the benefit. aren't that many approved alternatives here in Australia, with trattera being a non-stimulant I'm curious if it would be less heavy hitting. I'm not as worried if it's ""less effective"", given I've been on the minimum dosage of my current medication. obvious answer is to ask my prescribing Dr, however I was told dex is the ""best it's going to get"" and they all have similar side effects.

ADHD,"I've been struggling significantly the past few months. In the last two weeks, I haven't done \*any\* work. At all. I've also not come in for two weeks as well, although my boss is incredibly understanding and saying to take as long as I need. It's even paid. And that makes me feel horrible.   a while now I've kind of assumed I have ADHD based on asking my parents what they thought for example, and relating heavily to symptoms I'd read online, but obviously those are no excuse for a diagnosis. o I've been talking to a doctor for a while now, and he's prepared to schedule a neuropsych evaluation if I want one. But I realized in these past two weeks that I *don't* have ADHD. And I know that for sure. Even though I feared that if I researched too much into it, I'd start using it as an excuse without even getting a diagnosis, I did exactly that. I realized I've been blaming my recent strugles on something that I know I don't have.   do have diagnosed depression and I know that I've been in a major depressive episode for this two week period too, but that doesn't explain every time before that when I exhibited these same symptoms (just not as severe but still pretty telling), or even when I was a kid. o I thought about it and realized that assuming I have ADHD was entirely wrong. I realized that everytime, I just *choose to not do things*.    chose to not do chores when my parents told me as a kid and spend my time obsessively reading. I choose to interrupt a lot because I don't want to be left behind before I can say what I want to. I'm choosing right now to not do any work, and instead stare into space like I have for the past week, because I don't like doing work. I don't like doing work, that's it. I know if I do work, eventually I'll have to go back into work as well. And I just don't like doing work at all. I like the feeling of taking showers, but I don't like the work that's involved, so I choose not to. I choose to do literally nothing. And that realization has made me feel horrible recently because of how badly it reflects on me as a person.   stressing my parents out, they're very worried for me and want me to do better. And I still choose to not do work and stare at the ceiling. My boss is concerned and genuinely wants to do whatever he can to make it easier for me to resume my activities slowly. And all I'm doing is taking advantage of that by knowing I'm choosing to not do anything and collect pay. I feel so so so anxious thinking about how much I'm going to ruin my near future soon if I don't do anything, and I *still choose not to do anything*. Not doing work isn't the only symptom I have by the way, I fit almost all of the ones I found online, but I realized that it's not because I have ADHD; it's because often I'm choosing to do things like this, and that makes me kind of a horrible person lol. Not even the pressure of being right at deadlines and needing to do things *right now* or they're over has an effect on me like it always did in school; I still choose not to do things, and I've chosen that for like a year now.   sorry for saying all of that. The point of this I guess was to say I'm sorry for any previous posts I may have made on here asking questions that assumed I have ADHD, I was wrong.

ADHD,"TLDR below trying to figure out how to get back in touch and apologize.  I guess this is anxiety related but I also think the way I cope/respond is related to my ADHD.   Once I find a way to procrastinate or distract myself I hyperfocus on it and *just don't stop.*   I was having some issues - fatigue, nausea (from my new ADHD medication! Arrg!).  And I totally stopped communicating with a sweet older lady and friend of the family who I'd been doing working for weekly, she paid me well and I know the work I did made her happy (planting a garden/flowers etc).  I couldn't decide whether I wanted to do the work anymore - I was afraid of triggering the recent fatigue issue, was getting bored with the work, feeling like I was failing in other areas of life and I should focus on those, yet not.  I went into weeks of distracting myself from feeling depressed - reading obsessively - it felt so good to get lost in the story and so bad to be in reality - when I wasn't distracting myself I felt as if all of the difficult things in my life were *fresh* \- family illness, deaths, not succeeding at my career path, no savings, no new friends since moving.    eventually came up for air and had some positive experiences that got me out of that rut.  But the anxiety I feel over disappearing and letting someone down (she wasn't the only one!) is eating me up and I'm trying to figure out what to say to her.  There are so many people I've done this to and it hurts my relationships, yet when I want to isolate I just do it completely and can't bring myself to address anything in the moment.

I don't experience hyperfocus, my brain feels like a constant buzz that makes it so tiring for me to do any kind of studying, even stuff I enjoy. Well, and there's of course the things I don't enjoy: my brain shuts completely down, and every time I feel like I'm wrangling a zoo in my head trying to read a single paragraph.I experience rejection and failure much more intensely, which is why I barely get into any of the hobbies I'd like to get into, I'm too scared to fail, so I don't.

ADHD,I started Concerta about 3 weeks ago and it was great. I was able to come home from school get everything and then some done. I realized I now had time to go the gym after work began going 3-4 days my second week. Ate the last of my junk food the first week have restricted my self to 1500 calories a day and only water past two weeks. eems like my Adhd medicine worked amazing my first week I was focused higher frustration tolerance able to recall things easier very productive. Then half way into my second week I’m not focused and I am irritable.

ADHD,"Just got the vaccine Thursday (so three days ago). The first day, I slept all day so not sure of heart rate. The second day, I noticed my heart rate was higher than usual (usually run 85-90 sitting due to asthma, resting at 105 that day). Today, I was doing light work today and my heart rate shot to 156 but slowly came back down. That’s the highest it’s ever been, so I’ve been taking it easy since. I usually run around 125 while doing light work. see that increased heart rate is a side effect of the vaccine; however, as we know, it’s a side effect of stimulants too. It’s hard to tell what is stemming from where, especially since I took a day off from Vyvanse the day I got my shot (had to take an anxiety med and didn’t want to push my luck). else on stimulants have this kind of reaction with the vaccine?

I don’t want to wait that long and plan to start taking a backup supply of adderall until my appointment. I want to be honest and tell the new doctor I’ve been taking adderall because it will set my tolerance higher for whatever he agrees to start me at (meaning I’m worried if I lie that he’ll start me on too low a dose and it won’t work because I’ll have already started over a month earlier).

ADHD,"Hi all. I'll have been on 40 mg of trattera for 4 weeks this coming Wednesday. The reason I'm on trattera and not a stimulant is 1) I haven't had the full eval to diagnose me officially with ADHD yet, and 2) Because of a history of bad allergic reactions to drugs, I've had my genes tested for contraindications, and trattera is the only ADHD medication that doesn't put me at high risk for severe side effects.  immediately upon starting trattera, I got the dry mouth and nausea. Both have mostly subsided by now, but I can't get over how scatterbrained I feel. It's like my ADHD paralysis got turned up to 11. My primary complaint that led to this prescription was that I struggle to start tasks, and I feel that's gotten even worse. And if/when I am able to start tasks, like my work, I'm easily overwhelmed, stressed and irritable.  other big, lingering side effect is that I've completely lost my appetite. I'm someone who *loves* food, probably to the point of an unhealthy fixation, but now nothing ever ""sounds good"" to me. I forget to eat until late in the day if not forced, and I've been relying on meal replacement beverages to ensure I at least eat *something* with nutrition throughout the day.  can cope with the lack of appetite, to be totally honest. I can plan around my utter lack of interest in food and make accommodations for myself to keep myself healthy. What I'm struggling with is this heightened awareness of every fleeting thought combined with the total inability to start anything. I'm not sleeping, because all I can think about is what I can't force myself to complete. I'm laying awake at night already in distress over the next day's work. My motivation has plummeted; if I do anything, it's a survival mechanism out of sheer overwhelm or disgust with myself.  have a med check with my psychiatrist later this week, and obviously I'll tell her all of this, but I suspect she'll tell me to wait another 2-4 weeks or up my dosage a bit, as that's what she indicated the plan of action would be when she first prescribed trattera to me. Mostly, I came here to see if anyone else has had this experience on trattera, and if so, did it get better? Did you ever stop feeling like the living embodiment of the Bojack Horseman ""tupid Piece of hit"" episode? How long did that take, and at what dosage?  looking for a little hope here.

I was boiling mad that I keep having to climb a fence to get into my own goddamn yard and when I'm angry I get sloppy about details. Didn't even realize what I'd done until I was leaving for work this morning and couldn't find it. Obviously wasn't in the alley where I left it, because that would be too easy. include: my wallet with all my IDs and cards, my journal with my whole schedule and all my therapy notes, my copy of The Adult ADHD Toolkit, a library book, a bottle of backup meds, and my newly minted passport that I'd literally just gotten in the mail. was so proud of myself for being on top of logistics for my trip to Puerto Rico this Christmas. ent in the paperwork for a new passport in July, with plenty of room for error before I fly out at the end of December.  now I'll be lucky to get a replacement even on an expedited timeline, so I might not be able to travel at all.

The dizzy, untethered sensation that happens when your things aren't where you thought they were, only it happens 5-10 times a day.

ADHD,"This isn't really a complaint? I love Vyvanse so far. Been on it for just a little less than a month now and my life has improved in ways I didn't think were possible. It's just that the stimulation it gives me can really fuck over my day if something triggers a panic attack. (off Vyvanse) my panic attacks are mercifully short-lived with very little physical effects outside of my heart rate increasing and this sort of prickly feeling all over my skin. Everything else is mental, like derealization and racing thoughts. *on* the Vyvanse, if a panic attack starts up, I feel like I get everything on the physical side. My legs and arms feel tense and stiff, my heart starts going a mile a minute, I have a hard time breathing, and my whole body just feels numb. The derealization isn't as bad, which is kinda strange? It's like it only amplified the physical effects of anxiety but dulled the other ones. It also takes forever, sometimes the entire day, just to come down from it. totally understand that you guys aren't doctors, I'm planning on bringing this up to my therapist during our next appointment, but I was just wondering if anyone has any anecdotes that can relate to this or general advice that can help me out til then?

It’s a pretty terrible mental debate for me as to whether or not some of my problems are the fault of ADHD, or if I’m just kind of fucked up naturally, and I don’t want to group everyone or anyone who has it into them so if you take offense i’m sorry. has caused me bad grades, poor attentive skills, and much more that I don’t need to list because you all know what they are. You suffer them too. But let me tell you, it would be a godsend to JUT have to deal with those problems. Because the worst part of it, for me, is none of those.  hyper fixation. I can’t take it, how attached I can get to anything. It's always been a problem, one that just keeps getting worse. Here's how it's most recently (though not very recent) affected me. 2 years ago, I discovered a new musical artist. Really liked her music. I listened to more and more of her music as time went on. There were nearly zero of her songs I didn't like. oon it was all I listened to. And soon after that, I became rather infatuated with not just her music but her and her physical appearance. It honestly started out as a good thing I like to believe, it encouraged me to improve myself. I improved my school grades. I worked out more, and ate healthier. Mind you I, wasn't physically unhealthy, I just wanted to be *perfect* . And that's when it became a problem. I never really believed that I'd be *with her* , but I just kind of thought ""don't worry about that. It's probably not true. You can think about that later, just focused on being absolutely perfect in the meantime. After all, There will never be any chance anyway if you are not an absolutely perfect human being"". I  came to reality with that, though, and it just put me in a depressive state. It didn't stop my attempts at self improvement, at becoming a perfect guy, though. It just changed my outlook on why. I thought, ""why do I deserve to have gone through that? To be led on by myself?"". I wanted to be perfect so I could do to other people what I had done to myself. I wanted people to be attracted to me, to be obsessed with me, because I'd never want them, and THEY'D see how it feels to be so fixated on someone or something and never achieve your goal, like it was THEIR fault somehow. I lost friends in this mentality too, surprise surprise. I don't know if my plan ever worked. I like to think it didn't.

I have been doing some research into ADHD and am going to get tested in a few weeks. o many of these symptoms have resonated with me, such as  being able to pay attention when something is not stimulating -forgetting things often -getting bored easily and moving to something else-getting hyperfixated on certain things-having lots of trouble sleeping  others. parents don't really think I have ADHD because I never really outwardly broadcasted these things growing up, but they would always happen in my brain and I wouldn't really share them with anyone.  have never really had problems in school which is apparently the telltale sign up until now, where I have a math class that is not stimulating in the slightest and I have a C in that class when I usually get straight A's.  who got diagnosed in their teens, can you relate to this?  is definitely a possibility I don't have ADHD, but my parents are also causing a lot of doubt and I just don't know how to feel about this. know this post is very disjointed, feel free to ask me more about myself and my experiences in the comments if you need more context and I will answer them the best I can without revealing too much personal information.Adhd Possibility?",1635123195,1252,223

Then, you’re left feeling so overwhelmed and as if everyone hates you but it’s because they’re not understanding where your head is at? I got diagnosed with ADD at 14.

ADHD,"Recently I started a new job and it’s really, really fucking me up. I struggle really hard to learn the basics of anything, and especially a whole new job, but I was somehow lucky enough to be kept on after a trial period when a lot of new starts with me got let go, because I managed to fit in well with my coworkers and ‘seemed’ to be learning well. I managed to fake knowing what I was doing with a smile, friendliness and a good attitude. But in the last couple of weeks as the training wheels have come off management have had to have 2 separate sit downs with me about my performance. One time it was cause I left something in an oven for like an hour after getting distracted and doing a whole other task that wasn’t as important and expecting someone else to get it, which was bad enough, I literally could have caused a fire from how fucking careless I am. Big fuck up. o, I thought to myself that I need to give this 100% and really try my very best from here on out. I’ve been stressed in work since then trying to really get every little detail perfect. mental effort doesn’t matter. Because after today’s shift 2 managers sat me down privately and told me my performance wasn’t good enough today. It was humiliating. I was focusing on tasks that didn’t need done urgently and forgetting basic shit I needed to be doing (story of my fucking life), making my coworkers have to pick up the slack who were visibly annoyed, and the thing is if they hadn’t sat me down I’d have just assumed I was doing okay and that my coworkers had some issue with me. It’s so embarrassing that they probably all realise the ways I’m fucking up while I’m oblivious to it, I never even knew how badly I was fucking up. They’ve been really kind and patient with me, and so have management, but I think the only reason I currently am getting a pass is because they seem to like me a lot as a person and want to see me turn it around. I’m scared I can’t. The only thing that could probably help is fixing the underlying issue; getting help for the ADHD that’s probably hung over my entire life, but I haven’t even started pursuing that because, guess what, it’s too daunting and I do everything I can to put it off. One of the managers who sat in on that meeting stopped me privately and asked me one on one about half an hour later if I was okay after that meeting, in the most genuine way. That for some reason hurt the most. This manager, she is a complete and utter hardass, she gets pretty pissed when little things go wrong, but I think she likes me as a person too and genuinely wants to see me do well, and wanted to make sure I was alright and not taking it all to heart. he tried to reassure me it will click eventually, that it was a hard day too and that it happens, but coming from her who’s hard on basically everyone it felt somehow scarier. It was like she’s went beyond the usual tactics she’d use with people and has no idea how else to help me, or that I’m so pathetic at this that she has no choice but to feel sorry for me. I fucking am taking it to heart. I hate myself for being like this. I told her it was fine, that they have a job to do and it’s not their fault if I’m not performing, and it’s me that needs to do better, but she honestly just looked kind of sad for me lmfao. I think I sounded like an emotional wreck when they sat me down cause I honestly just wanted to cry. I hid it behind self-deprecating jokes and apologising and asking how I can do better, like I always seem to do in work and life in general. It never changes. Here I am, the guy who was told growing up I was so talented, so smart, I could be anything I wanted to be, I had such a bright future ahead of me, and I can’t even grasp anything I put my mind to. Being an adult is just fucking overwhelming and it feels like I’m trying, truly trying so fucking hard, and even if I try twice as hard I can’t reach what a ‘normal’ person can with half the effort. I think people can tell I put the effort in but just wonder what the fuck is wrong with me, and it’s so much worse letting people down constantly when they want you to do well.I still can’t grasp the basics of a job I started 2 months ago, and I’m scared I might get fired if these careless mistakes continue",1635122267,4257,835
ADHD,"I go through these cycles where I'm on dating apps constantly for a few days and then completely forget about them. Basically, I'll feel lonely and remember the apps and start swiping and messaging a bunch of people, and then it starts to feel meaningless/pointless, and I lose all interest or forget.  if I start vibing with one person, I then focus on just them and ignore the other conversations. I'm not trying to be a dick, but I feel like I'm so monogamous (or hyperfocused?) I can only even be interested in one person at a time and everyone else fades into the background. This is not a great strategy, because if it doesn't work out with them, I then have no other conversations going and the it feels even more pointless to swipe. curious if other people can relate to this and if they've found any solutions. I'm trying to be positive and force myself to check in regularly, but I can't help losing interest and that makes it even harder to be consistent. context, I'm a queer woman so I have a smaller dating pool and it's hard to meet women in real life because I have a slightly malfunctioning gaydar.

ADHD,"I’ve been on Atomoxetine (or trattera) for about 5 days now and I find it strange that I feel anxious and I’m getting bad headaches. Also, some difficulty swallowing, gagging, and loss of appetite. Honestly it feels similar to adderall crash, but it’s all day. I got started on 40mg (which sounded high to me) but my primary doctor assured me this was a common starting dose. I started having these side effects on day 1. been off of adderall for a year now because it made my GERD symptoms go from a 5 to an 11. I had to clear my throat constantly (which I found out recently is a gerd symptom) to the point that I couldn’t breathe. This stopped after I quit adderall, but my ADHD got worse and worse over time after quitting so I decided to switch to a non-stimulant that wouldn’t trigger my gerd. o far, that’s been pretty manageable. anyone else here have any experience taking this that can let me know if it’s normal to experience this early on? Do these side effects go away gradually?

Trying to get info about every little action they make to the point where i can actually read them. I dont know if its adhd or something else.

ADHD,"I have terrible ADHD, I just have so much I want to do and so much time but I never end up doing anything and alot of times I just skip sleep thinking about what I need to be doing and end up still not doing it. IDK if ADHD can get worse but I feel like that's been happening to me. Before, I couldn't focus on lengthy lectures or talks of any kind even if I'm interested in the topic. Now, even when people talk to me I find it hard to hear the full sentences before I lose my focus! I don't know how to control or stop this from happening! Is this problem purely psychological or does it have other symptoms?Also, when I was diagnosed, at first I was so happy knowing that now I can finally take steps to treat it but was just treated with denial from my family who pretended ADHD and my diagnoses never happened which prevented me from getting the medicine/treatment of any kind. My dad tells me it's all my imagination since I'm ""smart"" and got good grades in school, then there is no way i have ADHD. İn school i mostly slept or doodled through my classes and ended up cramming before exams which worked for the most part because the content was so easy for me but that process didn't hold up for university (go figure). Also I keep dropping things/ falling down and losing things more and more recently, my siblings make fun of me for being so clumsy all the time and I'm really bothered by it, since i can't help it. why does it feel like my ADHD is getting so much worse?Are there any other ways to treat ADHD without taking medication? I lost my diagnoses papers so i can't get medication and even when i did have it my dad didn't let me have medication.For context I'm in my senior year of Computer cience, actually this is my 6th year since starting university so i am pretty late, i should have graduated long ago so the ""smart"" can't have ADHD argument has burst long ago if i am able to convince my dad. I feel like the last 6 years of university feel really muddled, i can't remember what I studied or who I've met, even if i get an A on a difficult subject a semester ago, i forget what it was even about. eriously i don't know what i should do at this point, i just want to graduate and end this misery, afterwards I'll even forget i ever went to university.I feel like i lost so many good opportunities and time because i left my ADHD untreated but i have no way of proving what i experienced and no one to believe me in my family. Any sort of guidance from you guys would be so appreciated. I'm currently broke so i can't get another psychiatric evaluation or afford medication.I was diagnosed with ADHD in my freshman year of university.

Now I feel the weight, it’s nice but I almost feel like it could be 1-2kg heavier for more effect. Is it just my imagination?

ADHD,"It isn’t until the last year or so I’ve started realising I probably have ADHD. I grew up being constantly told how smart I was, I done really well in school, and apart from a couple of notable exceptions, nobody picked up on what was going on behind the scenes. Namely, that I never studied until the last minute, that I would fuck around in class, pay minimal attention (but still absorb enough), and just finish my work in 5 minutes at the end, etc. The signs were there, but they were kind of hidden. My realisation came from seeing things about ADHD and started as a little ‘huh, a lot of this stuff seems relatable’, but I never considered it too seriously. ure, I am chronically forgetful, I took ages to grasp ‘simple’ everyday things as a kid, I was constantly making the same easy, silly mistakes, I felt like everyone else just ‘got’ certain things that I never understood, I had executive dysfunction up the wazoo and struggled really hard to focus when I wasn’t intensely interested, etc., but I always just put it down to me being me, somehow different and inadequate. My parents couldn’t understand how I was smart, but could never grasp simple things they tried to teach me over and over again. I always felt out my depth. Over the pandemic I started doing more research and it was like it all clicked into place.  life since I finished school has been a bit of a mess. I struggle really hard to learn at new jobs and fit into the workplace probably seem really slow to everyone around me and it causes me so much anxiety, I outright failed one of my college courses after being almost straight A my entire life because I never learned how to manage my own workload, I was ‘behind’ my peers constantly in everyday stuff, I couldn’t focus on anything that wasn’t watching TV or movies or video games or whatever I was currently hyper focusing on, constantly forgot simple things that fucked me over in a massive way (I one time forgot to bring a calculator to a calculator only exam), etc., the list goes on and on. I graduated, but by the absolute skin of my teeth and coursework was constantly left to the very last second when I had a looming deadline to motivate me. I was too busy ‘slacking off’, drinking, going out, etc., but it was because adult responsibilities didn’t even cross my mind to attempt until they caused me grief, and when they did I’d just ignore it until it was too late. seems to get worse and worse the older I get and the more I’m expected to have matured and be able to fend for myself. I feel like I need someone to just tell me what to do all the time because if I don’t I’m fucking clueless.  I started a new job though and it’s really, really fucking me up.

I'm currently taking 5 classes which was a huge mistake. But impatient me thought that if I just took 5 classes this semester and 5 classes next semester I would be able to graduate sooner. When I was picking my classes it seemed like a great idea. My goals and ideals tend to be very ambitious, but I always struggle to execute them or to consider how they will play out in real life. I'm falling behind in all of my classes and on top of that I have 4 ""Incomplete"" classes that I need to finish by the end of the semester and a part time job.  those who don't know what an Incomplete class is - if you experience extenuating circumstances during a semester sometimes your professors will allow you to take an ""Incomplete"" which gives you an extra semester or year to complete the coursework. They put an ""I"" on your transcript until the final grade is determined. o essentially it's like I'm taking 9 classes right now, but I haven't worked toward the Incompletes whatsoever.  also registered as having a disability with the tudent Accessibility services at my school which makes my professors more willing to work with me. It also gives me some flexibility on due dates which is very helpful, but I continuously need extra time for assignments and I feel awful for constantly asking my professors for more time.

I feel like such a disappointment and failure because I'm 25 and still haven't graduated college yet. My parents, family and boyfriend's parents always ask me when I'm going to graduate and I never have a clear answer. It seems like my symptoms are getting worse even though I'm medicated.  think being away from campus might also be a factor. I moved back home during the pandemic and live with my boyfriend, but I can't afford to return because rent is so insanely expensive where I went to school. But I hate where I'm from so. so. much. I have no friends and all of the people I work with are much older than I am so it's difficult to relate. I basically have no one to interact with on a personal level besides my boyfriend and my mom. I feel very isolated and have no idea what to do or how to dig myself out of this hole I've created. I'm at the point where I'm thinking about dropping out of college, but I'm so close to finishing it would feel like a huge waste of time and money. Or I'm thinking about quitting my job so I can focus on school full time in an attempt to fix this problem, but that would take a slight financial toll on me. I also have the option of withdrawing from some of my Fall classes, but would lose money on that as well. I don't know what to do. I'm posting here partially to vent and would also really appreciate any support or advice if you have any to give.Beyond overwhelmed with college/life and have gotten myself into a pickle?",1635117203,3213,593
ADHD,"I work in a bar, thats been pretty stressful with lockdowns and we currently have to do table service. (omething we are not used to) weekend two ex employees came up for a drink, but were pretty cooked. Im usually the manager that trains employees, tries to make them feel welcome and have a friend. o its not unusual for me to stand out a little to a new face. problem is these two remembered me, i only remembered one of them. The one i didnt came up and greeted me by name, and i was caught off guard. Because she seemed drunk i had wrote it off as a customer and cut her off, saying ill give her a 10 minute break and have some water. boyfriend eventually got aggressive with me that i didnt serve her. He asked how could i think she was intoxicated and i explain she was slurring her speech and giving illogical responses in my conversation with her. told me english is her 3rd language (didnt really matter, she was still cooked) and she asked me if i remembered her. immediately said no and saw her face. It dropped. I felt awful, to be that guy. To not have any memories and imply she didnt make an impact or mattered. he only worked with me a couple of weeks, and after talking with some coworkers i remembered some things. But i hate how horrible i was, i had no answer or justification to why i couldnt remember but she could. wanted to blurt out I have adhd and we can struggle with memory sometimes... but i felt it would look like a made up excuse to cut the tension.I forgot about a person and felt awful",1635117082,1519,292
ADHD,"I was diagnosed as a kid with ADHD. My parents/the school had me on Ritalin. It did nothing, my parents pulled me out of public school and homeschooled me. My mom had me on caffeine pills through most of my childhood. It works for maintaining focus on immediate task. Useless for my working memory issues. Constantly loose my keys, wallet, the thing I put down 3 seconds ago. I moved from a mechanic position, which I was great at, but it's hard on my body, and as I get older it hurts to go to work. I was offered a management position, I took it the bump in pay was significant. The work is basically MUCH faster pace and tasks can change on a dime. I can't afford to go back to being a tech. I have my step son seeing a psychiatrist because his ADHD is so bad, he can't maintain a full day of school. he mentioned that it would be good for me as well as for stepson if I went on meds.

ADHD,"Good afternoon,  recently got an official diagnosis for ADHD as an adult (combined type) and just started Adderrall XR 20MG about three days ago. I'm noticing small differences that are definitely positive, but the effect seems a little more underwhelming than what was explained to me by the prescribing doctor. They did say that it is common that adjustments need to be made, so I'm just trusting in the process and taking it one day at a time.  being said, what were key things that you noticed when you found the right dosage of medicaiton and how it helped your overall ability to function?

ADHD,"I think I might have adhd. I am not comfortable with saying that I think I have adhd - I won't self diagnose since I feel like I am faking my symptoms. In a few months, I will have an appointment to get tested.  I (19, m) might have adhd. I have always had at least some symptoms that I can remember. I always had obsessions with certain topics as kid. I never knew when to shut up, I was always extremely, loud. My parents apparently never were concerned about this, so the never got me testet. I was 15, school always used to be easy for me. I never had to study, I just payed minimal. attention at school and it was enough. In high-school, I had to study for the first time in my life, and I barely made it through. I didn't develop any kind of discipline, my only motivation was the existential dread.  I am working, and the symptoms are terrible.

I would love to study webdesign at some college, but I am afraid this would just be another hyperobsession and that it would be too much for me, so I most likely won't do that.  have friends with adhd who told me that they think that I have adhd a few times since I apparently have an ""adhd way of having conversation"", like jumping from one to another topic, becoming very emotional, interrupting the other person etc. I don't know. I have to test it to be sure, and for now, all I can do is wait for my test  don't even know what I want to say with this post. It just fucking sucks feeling like an imposter at the same time as feeling like you can't function properly. don't want to fake adhd, but I feel like I do. I am afraid of getting clarity about it, if it turns out that I do have adhd this would mean that something really is wrong with me that cannot be fixed by anything(no offense guys), and if I don't, this would most likely mean that I am just a lazy person with a fucked up attention span and no social skills and tell myself that I have adhd so I can feel more comfortable with postponing important tasks just feels like getting tested is a lose lose situation, and having  for reading this (you probably didn't anyways lol, tldr down there) I might have undiagnosed adhd and it really is fucking with me, especially since I can't do anything else than wait for my appointment rn.

ADHD,"Hey fellow inattentive community, like the title says, I just recently got prescribed Adderall for the first time as an adult two weeks ago. This was a dream come true for me as I knew I needed it, and my ADHD seriously dampens my quality of life. I've taken it a handful of times before as an adult ""recreationally"" but never to party or anything, just to get things done like packing to move and deep cleaning my house, not usually any higher than 30mg at once, and found it to be effective at that dose. However, I was prescribed 15mg IR 3x a day, and I noticed the first couple days I started taking it that I never experienced the whole honeymoon phase and euphoria that many boast about when they're newbies. I've felt this before when I took it sparingly, but not this time. In fact taking it as prescribed actually made me feel much worse and like I was crashing all day after the first dose, which felt very mild. I spoke to my doctor about it and he upped my dose and is trying me on Vyvanse. ince I don't have to worry about running out of the Adderall now, I've started experimenting with doses to find out what's effective for me and I've noticed 30mg at one time is about the lowest I could go while still feeling like it's working, and I've gone as high as 45mg at one time, and that made me feel great, but not euphoric or tweaky in any way, just very focused and motivated to complete my tasks and work without any issues. I have only experienced very minor side-effects such as appetite suppression and my jaw getting a little tight, able to sleep just fine at night. I was wondering if anyone has a similar experience, and could maybe enlighten me as to why I seem to have such a high tolerance to stimulants? I read on here that some people take 5mg twice a day and they're fully productive, which can be very confusing because I'm sure I could not even notice if I took that low of an amount.Freshly prescribed Adderall for the first time as an adult, but takes a large dose to be effective",1635115304,2011,380

ADHD,"I suck at typing short and well. Please skip and skim text if you wish.   on ritalin 10mg for like a month but didn't notice much positive effects except sometimes being good at tyding up. Doc switched to Vy 50mg (not 30...?).   day: took at 6pm and could not sleep at night. Very clear mood change due to **focus** and ability to talk as much as I usually do but with more finesse, control, and maybe even energy to use my true brainpower.  (ame with typing and reading, having much more power and fuel. Confidence, no anxiety, tho similar to being hyperactive, not how i would be when drunkhyper from alcohol. I could talk a lot [like I said, not abnormal for me] but without losing control and overdo it. Now my mind and speech cooperated.) the first night I fell asleep at like 6am. Usually i sleep within midnight ish. My fault for taking it too late in the day lol.  Next time it was a bit earlier night sleep. Noticed a bit **irritability** by the evening on the third and fourth night.  omeone wrote in a reddit comment they had to take a bit of another capsule mixed with juice to be able to sleep bc they had such a noisy mind. Idk if it's **withdrawal** i get. the imposter syndrome(?) of being scared I'm not actually ADHD, happens sometimes bc I'm, both at the time of writing the title and in general before starting the meds, easily concerned without being a hypochondriac, and not very good at relaxing without worry, at least tonight when i felt really crappy/ groggy.  I just imagine the ""oh no, you can't take this unless you have ADHD! You'll get sick maybe even!"" Ah I hope someone can convince me it's no reason to worry bout it. all day on my phone, didn't work out or even play videogames. Waiting too long to eat. Didn't walk or work out even a tad. Didn't socialize, which is a big motivator to move and do stuff. Was alone. I **forgot to take my usual morning antidepressants** until later in the day (20mg brintellix/Vortioxetine). At first I blamed it on that. But now I'm not very keen on taking the Vyvanse 50mg tomorrow morning. I feel like I'm either gonna crash in the evening again or crash AND feel like crap without doing much all day, again like today.   it's weird getting used to my new brain since starting Vyvanse. I would hyper focus on my phone and get ready way too late to meet my friend, and instead of hurrying, do all the stuff I wanted to do, to get ready.   I can't keep it short here smh but that's all I can share, I think. Gonna sleep and now l feel better already lol, but would love to hear advice/tips/knowledge/supportive words :) thanks so much!!Vyvanse 50mg for 3 days now, atm feeling awful going to bed.

ADHD,"My boyfriend (23M) and I (24F) have been living together for a year and a half now. I was just diagnosed with moderate ADHD-C last week. My boyfriend says that all of his teachers recommended he get tested for it, and that doctors have always talked about it with him since he can remember. We don’t know if that’s a “proper” diagnosis, but no person has ever NOT assumed he has severe ADHD. His parents do not believe in medication or therapy, and my ADHD parents had a hard time helping manage my sisters AD and severe ADHD so I went unnoticed. I have been extremely independent since I was young, and my flitting through the coping mechanisms of obsessive organization, eating disorders, self harm, and self deprecation helped me fly under the radar. 😬🙃 we both have been managing it on our own, un-therapized and unmedicated, trying to work and do school and function as adults. It’s been hard. I mentioned my coping mechanisms, my boyfriends included struggling with addiction and went he wasn’t coping he failed and entire semester of college. I finished my first degree in 2020 and after decompressing for 6 months decided to tackle my mental health with therapy, which led to my diagnosis. I’ve got an appointment to talk about meds soon, but he can’t address his ADHD right now bc he got a spur of the moment second job on top of full-time school and “absolutely cannot even think about more appointments” (understandable lol).  last few months I been reading a lot about ADHD and started to see how it affects our relationship and household. Chore wars, “where has all our money gone 😩”, no food in the fridge/too much food spoiling away in the fridge, petty irritation, everything is everywhere, trying to leave the house is madness….overall chaos🥴 Thankfully we are very much in love and there’s a lot of trust between us and we both want to manage our ADHD and be happy in our home together. I’m starting to feel really hopeful about our future together, but thinking of adding careers and children in there still makes me feel overwhelmed and ill, even.

ADHD,I (40m) have ADHD. I just realized it in the last two years. It’s been a struggle but I’ve figured out how to deal with it in my own ways. I’m not on any medication. One of my daughters (18F) has been diagnosed and tried a couple medications.  son (8) definitely struggles with ADHD and I’ve been resistant to any kinds of medication. I really embrace ADHD as a valuable thing that has had positive trade offs in my life.  I see my son struggling with so many of the problems focusing that I had and the negative consequences that come with it. He’s incredibly self aware for his age. He says things like “sometimes my brain just has trouble focusing”. I’m thinking of getting him some medication that he can try and choose whether to take if he thinks it helps him.

ADHD,"For the first time in my life I think I understand what it feels like to be normal. My mind feels quiet and I feel calm. I was diagnosed in 2017 but stopped medication after Adderall XR, Concerta, and Vyvanse weren’t helping. I decided to get help again and Adderall IR was a game changer. On my first day of taking it I was at the park with my girlfriend. About 30 mins after taking it I realized how quiet everything was. he was talking to me and I was listening but I was looking around me astounded that there was no “noise.” It felt like the world was put on pause and I could direct my focus towards anything. have always known that there was something inherently wrong with me. I vividly remember having a mental break down when I was in the 3rd grade; I had to memorize a short song for homework but it just felt impossible. I vividly remember the first time I realized that there was something wrong with me—I was in the 6th grade. I wanted to complete my homework, but I couldn’t. I knew I was physically capable of doing the assignment, so I didn’t allow myself to do anything else. till, I just stared at my homework for an hour unable to start—it felt like there was an invisible wall. and after high school I felt broken, but I never understood how broken I was. Prior to receiving medication, I tried to develop semi-regular habits to help me function (making lists, keeping notes, using timers, etc). After starting medication, I realized that the habits I tried to develop in hopes of fixing what was wrong with me wasn’t possible, the things that are wrong with me aren’t curable.  also realized that not being able to concentrate or prioritize tasks is only a part of my issues. Constant “noise” on my mind, a disconnect with understanding my feelings (because of the noise I think?), irritability, losing track of time, interrupting people, urges/impulses, and feeling overwhelmed are more detrimental to my life than anything else. All of those issues either improve significantly or complete disappear when I take Adderall.  nearly every single part of my ability to function has drastically improved, I can’t help but feel upset and that I will never feel normal without medication. It’s wonderful when it works, I just wish I didn’t have time limit on being able to function properly everyday. Being able to rationally deal with different feelings instead of becoming overwhelmed is new to me.  happy and sad, but I’m happy to be sad. I’m finally beginning to understand myself. also not sure if how to differentiate ADHD from my personality. Am I who I am because of ADHD or is it just my personality? I have over a dozen projects/hobbies I’d like to work on but I’m not really sure where to start.  last thing, is it possible that Adderall “clarified” autistic traits? I haven’t been diagnosed with autism but with my mind being so “quiet” I’ve been able to self reflect a lot and I realized I have lot of traits related to AD, mostly sensory issues.  I can’t stand clutter, I can’t handle loud spaces/restaurant, I can’t handle yelling. In the past, if I got yelled at or disappointed I kind of shut down and didn’t speak. I’d kill my mood for hours to the point of just nodding yes/no or shrugging.

ADHD,"I’m a 26M from the UK. I was diagnosed with ADHD a few months back (mostly inattentive/ distraction symptoms but with some hyperactivity).  I’ve always been successful and high scoring academically, but every aspect of my life outside of education is a complete disaster. feel incapable of being an adult. psych started me on Elvanse/ Vyvanse 6 weeks ago. We have been titrating doses. started on 20mg for 2 weeks - I initially got the honeymoon effect that everyone describes but this faded after the first day. I then to 30mg for 2 weeks- I did notice a benefit - but it didn’t seem to last that long. have now been on 40mg. Initially I noticed it gave me a huge burst of focus in the morning (much more than 30) but then I would crash around 4 hours later. that I’ve been on it for 2 weeks, it’s a lot slower to kick in. After around 2 hours, I feel calmer and much more focused (maybe too much?). My working memory and recall is way better (which is very beneficial - I am a medical student so I need to be able to recall things I’ve learnt previously). able to slow down and think through my decisions. And I’m making less careless mistakes. this doesn’t last. 2-3 hours later I’ll crash. I’ll be extremely tired, foggy and drained. I recover, it feels like the Elvanse is still in my system. My pulse rate is still higher than off the meds. anyone else experienced this? I’m not sure if my dose is too high, or if I’m just metabolising it too quickly? alternative would be Concerta, but I hear the comedown from that is brutal. love to hear if anyone has experienced anything similar?Elvanse dose too high or metabolising too quick?",1635110096,1638,301

ADHD,"Hi, I started taking 30mg of ritalin about 5 months ago. This is my first time ever on a stimulant and in addition to this I take Latuda and Lamotrigine. I take my medications at the same time, every day. I'm very cautious about making sure to keep to my schedule.  a month ago I noticed slight depression, anxiety, agitation. Over the weeks my symptoms have increasingly gotten worse. The past week I've been unable to eat, have extreme nausea, depression, anxiety/anxiety attacks. I've noticed it's about the time my ritalin has worn off. After missing one morning of my dose due to laying in bed feeling like crap, it got worse during the day. I'm starting to wonder if it's due to the ritalin? Even after talking to my psychiatrist, they suggested higher dosages of all my medications. I'm now wondering if it would be best to come off of it if I will continously need higher dosages.

But how does Dr. Dodson know this?   His clinical experience? A general agreement with his prescribing colleagues?  Research?   I don’t know his source, but because he is a psychiatrist and noted ADHD authority, I accept it as true. Barkley reports that people with ADHD live, on average 12 years less than those without ADHD.

ADHD,"Background: being diagnosed and medicated, my resting heart rate (recorded on my Apple Watch while sleeping) was between 84-90bpm. While awake, It would spike randomly throughout the day to 120-145bpm when I was anxious (which was… always). This also made me sweat constantly to the point my doctor wondered if I had [hyperhidrosis]( because no matter what I did or what the temperature was, I was always ***dripping*** sweat. I would literally sweat off my makeup as I put it on (even with a fan blowing in my face) and my hands were constantly M O I  T. It was horrible and made my anxiety so much worse which in turn made the sweating worse.  day:  after finagling my dosage for a few months, I am now on Adderall 30mg XR in the morning with a 20mg IR in the afternoon. The only side effect has been a bit of insomnia that I’m learning to manage. According to the same Apple watch as before, my resting heart rate has consistently been in the 55-65 range  and unless I exercise (yeah I need to do that more…) it rarely goes above 100bpm and when it does, it’s because I’m running around after my kids or in a difficult social situation (or any social situation where I don’t personally know the person I’m interacting with lol) and when it DOE “spike” due to anxiety, it stays at about 110bpm. I also hardly ever sweat anymore and it’s only during those few social interactions that I am uncomfortable with. My hands are dry now. I can put makeup on without a fan and the makeup lasts ***all day*** which was unfathomable before Adderall.  researched it and it seems a decrease in heart rate is reported among EXTREMELY hyperactive patients BUT… I never had hyperactivity. I am primarily the inattentive type of ADHD (previously known as ADD). I mean… my body isn’t hyper active. My mind, though, would go a million miles an hour 24/7 and I would explain it to my doctor by saying “it’s like my brain is always on 3x speed and I can’t control it”. I plan on asking my doctor at my next appointment. does anyone else have an experience similar to this on stimulants?Stimulants significantly lower my heart rate and anxiety instead of the common side effect of CAUSING anxiety and high heart rate. It’s weird and very relieving.",1635108376,2229,401

Both her and her boyfriend interrupt and it’s O bad. he can go on long rants, naming every detail and one story blends into the next. The whole time I’m sitting there feeling like I’m holding my breath and she’s suffocating me by not letting me speak. If I interrupt, she’ll speak louder. It got so bad I had to admit how it made me feel. If I hadn’t I genuinely think I would’ve ended up just blocking her cause it gave me so much anxiety every time I saw her in person. people get annoyed when I talk about my hyper fixations. One friend completely refuses to open the Tik Toks I send, even though they’re 100% relevant to her and not really to me. he assumes it’s about a band or something. Another has admitted “oh yeah once you start talking about xyz my brain just stops listening.” I laugh the pain off and pretend I wasn’t so excited about this thing that I could barely breathe. I understand not wanting to listen for 20 minutes straight about a band but sometimes I’m just excited about a new song and it’s like… I have to beg. I gladly listen to other people’s hobbies etc too, I usually find an interest in it. no matter how kind and open I am, I can never seem to make new friends. None that last.

I’m so grateful to have such a supportive partner but this makes me feel even more pressure to take the first step. omething I’m not good at in any part of my life.  course I’ve talked with my partner about how I’m feeling, and he asks what he can do to help and how to best support me during this process. However, I have no clue what to say to that. I don’t want the pressure of deadlines to fall on my fiancé or for him to feel responsible to keep me on track. He‘s overwhelmed enough by shouldering 50% of the process, without having to “babysit” me.  just don’t want this process to be miserable for either my partner or myself.

I personally do not like small talk or networking and am a bit shy to new people, but it is an inevitability in my life that I will have to do a bit of it. Does anyone have any good tidbits that have helped them in that realm that I and whoever else may feel inclined can look at as some sort of ""rules for socializing""? can start with an example: you ever feel you are running out of safe small talk topics, a great tip I've heard is use the acronym FORD (like life goals) four topics are safe and plentiful! got others?

ADHD,I’m m/21. I’ve always had issues with sexual desires even as a kid and most of the times overwhelm me. It makes me very impulsive and I say and do the dumbest things even tho I know I don’t want to. Giving into them doesn’t help because it will sometimes make them stronger and make me more impulsive. I used to workout to combat those and it worked but I no longer can since I live with my family on a couch. I also work long hours and then when I’m off I cook to prep my meals in the mornings. But the days where I have nothing to do the need is so strong. I wanted to go to the gym but thinking of working out around people makes me self conscious and anxious.

How do I know it's working? I had tried atomoxetine in the past but the side effects were too much for me (apparently because I started with a very high dosage). This time I'm coping alright with the side effects as long as I eat a substantial breakfast before taking it but I'm feeling a bit weird. I could finally read again like I used to but I had very bad brain fog the other day and I'm feeling more irritable lately.

ADHD,"Recently I came across this lecture, [""How to Unsuppress Emotions""]( and it really resonated with me and maybe it'll resonate for many of you as well. From this video I learned about alexithymia: an inability to identify and describe the emotions experienced by one's self as well as the emotions experienced by others (empathy). kind of emotional suppression most often arises during our developmental years, and is caused by: Trauma (e.g. bullied, childhood abuse/neglect) as an adaptive/protective mechanism. If a child lacks a guardian or parent in their lives that make them feel supported, loved, and generally good about themselves, the child will start suppressing their emotions because they don't want to feel like shit anymore. They also don't know how to healthily deal with their emotions.   * You hear a lot about how much ""potential"" you have or ""how capable you are"", which makes you feel scared and ashamed that you can't live up to these expectations.   * The parents can be loving and supportive, but it's not a substitute for emotional competence.* Culture. It's frowned upon for men to be ""emotional"" and ""vulnerable"", and in some cultures familial love may not be as well expressed (Asian families). It's not uncommon for children to go their entire lives without ever hearing their parents tell them they were loved, even if they could feel that love. feel like many people with ADHD will have grown up in an environment that has these components, especially because of how predisposed we are to emotional dysregulation and our perceived ""incompetence"" when we grow up not knowing we have ADHD. suffering from alexithymia will usually describe their emotions using physical language, e.g. ""a kick to the nuts""* ""a pit in my stomach""* ""my chest feels tight"" they may use umbrella terms: stressed* frustrated* overwhelmed* anxious what can you do about it?]( Recognize that *you are feeling* ***an emotion****.* It's okay if you don't know what that emotion is.2. Try to ""diagnose that emotion"". Ask yourself what you might be feeling (maybe even go through a literal list of emotions). Or you can ask yourself what someone else might be feeling in your situation. We're far better at analyzing the emotions of others than ourselves.   1. ""What would someone be feeling if they were rejected from their dream college?""3. Now that you are *aware* of what you're feeling, it becomes actionable. I'll leave the rest of this to the video, as I don't think I can do it justice. There is something called alexithymia that describes a person's difficulty with identifying the emotions of themselves and other people. This often makes them appear cold/distant. Fortunately, it's entirely treatable!I finally understand why it's so difficult for me to deal with emotions",1635099863,2782,455
ADHD,"I'm currently a senior in college and it's been a rough ride so far. ADHD has not made the process easy in terms of my education. At the risk of sounding cliche, I can't help but feel like a square peg in a round hole, and I'm pretty sick of it. It's halfway through the semester and I haven't really participated in any classes cause I feel so burnt out. I'm almost certainly going to fail them and I don't care, it feels good.   spent the entirety of high school shut-in wasting my time gaming. I didn't explore what I wanted to be, what other hobbies I could have. When I got to college I rolled the dice and got random roommates that I'm now friends with and have been living with for the entirety of college.  I've enjoyed college so far. I have enjoyed living with my housemates but I'm starting to want more. That maybe living with friends isn't enough anymore. Most of the people I know have gotten involved in Greek life and I'm beginning to realize I want something like that for myself.  want to expand out. I can't help but feel restless and that I need to make up for lost time.

ADHD,"For some added context, I’m 18 years old and just graduated high school this past year. My mom is at times supportive and loving, but can be extremely cold and manipulative at times. few weeks after I graduated, I decided that I wanted to get tested for ADHD. I already knew what the answer was, but my mom was dead set on not listening to my complaints about it. I brought it up to her at the beginning of my junior year. I was on probation, I was barely passing any of my classes and had absolutely no will to do anything about it. I was taking psychology at the time, and while we were learning about various mental illnesses, he pulled me aside and asked if I had ADHD and if i’d be willing to present my experience with the class. I told him that I didn’t, and continued on with my day.  went home that same night and researched it, eventually concluding that it was a fairly strong possibility that I did have it. When I brought it up to my mom, who said something along the lines of “well the school didn’t do anything about it so i’m not going to either.”  just shrugged it off and forgot about it for awhile, while i continued to blame my struggles on depression and anxiety that I was being treated for.  forward to my 18th birthday, I had become positive that I had ADHD. I again brought it up to my mom, who laughed it off. I decided that paying for it out of pocket myself was much easier than convincing her to go along with it. I saved up some money, and eventually got the test done.  psychiatrist that tested me then set up a video call the next week to discuss the result, which I made my mom attend. The first thing that the psychiatrist said was “I’m sorry that it took so long for this to be found, but we knew from the moment that we saw the results what the diagnoses was.”  was an amazing feeling to see my moms face change as they told me that i had “One of the worst cases of ADHD we have seen in a while.”  I wonder what my life would’ve been like if it was caught sooner, but i’m extremely happy and proud of what my life has come to. I’m now on Wellbutrin xl and 70mg’s of Vyvanse, and it’s completely changed the way I view life as a whole.   mom didn’t believe that I had ADHD, making me pay for the tests out of pocket.My experience with severe undiagnosed ADHD inattentive",1635099065,2305,446

ADHD,"o recently I've realized that most of my adhd symptoms have actually started (or was amplified) when I fell from my school bus in middle school (don't ask how it happened it's complicated lol but I fell and hit the back-left side of my head pretty hard) and then we went to hospital ofc. They've checked everything, tomography and all of that stuff and everything seemed alright, other then me being shocked and getting hurt a little bit. Now the thing is, I was already dealing with a lot of problems at the time; I was severely depressed and felt hopeless all the time and as a result I was failing my classes and would feel depressed about it as well and it would just become a vicious cycle of depression basically. Now my memory is very blurry, and I feel like it gets worse each year, and the reason I'm mentioning this is because I can't remember if I had symptoms of adhd before the incident. And because my memory is very blurry, I'm assuming it is either because of the concussion, or I am faking having adhd as an excuse. And thinking about this made me feel awful. But I can't stop thinking. And I'm having suicidal thoughts. I just feel like I'm trying to find an excuse to not study, or work, and that I'm just pill seeking. And that I'm making it all up, or exaggerating it.

ADHD,"I'm so goddamn tired. I'm tired of having to advocate for myself so hard and I'm tired of doctors who only hear 25% of what I say and fill in the rest and I'm tired of trying meds that don't work.  have, so far, tried: generic Adderall IR, up to 15mg 1/day, then 20mg name brand Adderall ER, 18mg generic strattera, back to the generic Adderall IR, 10mg 2/day, and most recently, 27mg generic concerta.  these, generic strattera worked the best. It was honestly amazing, but the side effects were awful. I was getting so angry I was shaking at the drop of a hat, and was having a really intense and painful cycle of constipation and diarrhea.(A side effect my med manager told me wasn't real because no one she's ever treated has experienced it. I asked if maybe that meant I should try the name brand, figuring I was reacting to a non-active ingredient, and she laughed, then asked me if I have IB. My digestive issues are well documented in my chart and she and I had talked about them at length in our previous appointment.)  the strattera was almost worth all of that, because taking it, it was like I didn't have ADHD at all. And I was only on 18mg for a bit over 2 weeks. I was able to get through an entire to do list consistently, I was decisive, I didn't have to make the conscious decision to do every single little task, I could just do them. I would say it had to be placebo bc of how strattera works, but I didn't expect the medication to work *at all* and kinda didn't want it to tbh because it was 6x the cost of generic Adderall IR and just barely fit into my budget. Adderall IR kind of helps. It makes it easier for me to force myself to do things I absolutely have to, but that's where the benefit ends. The biggest reason I am trying to get my ADHD treated is that I have a lot of things I *want* to do that I can't as a result of executive dysfunction. Like start a photography business and finish the half a dozen novels I've started and clean my room and do the dishes. Basically, the IR gets me through work and that's it.  brand Adderall ER turned me into a genuine lunatic. I was a walking ADHD stereotype. Every symptom I deal with was worse and every symptom I usually don't made an appearance. Total paradoxical effect.  started concerta today. As soon as it kicked in I was completely unable to do anything. I slept for almost 3 hours and woke up craving a ton of sugar. But I don't have the energy to even go to the store. The only reason I have gotten out of bed at all today is to use the bathroom.  the one hand, this should make it easy to know what to try next. Clearly I need a nonstimulant. Really, in my opinion that should have been the next step when the strattera had such a major positive impact and the Adderall didn't, but my med manager didn't think so apparently. med manager is a fucking joke. I have an adhd diagnosis from a psychologist who has been really amazing, but can't prescribe. o I have a psychiatric nurse practitioner who clearly doesn't believe my diagnosis. he has diagnosed me with generalized anxiety and seems to think that's my only issue. To be clear, this woman isn't supposed to be diagnosing me with anything, she is a consultant working with my primary care to determine a good medication fix for a pre diagnosed condition. Also, I definitely don't have GAD. he seems to have based this diagnosis mostly on the fact that I answered ""yes"" when she asked me if I have a hard time concentrating. I did not know she was doing an anxiety screening, or I would have offered more context, like the fact that I have trouble concentrating bc I have ADHD. I have no other symptoms of GAD. top of that, when I told her about the reaction I had to name brand Adderall, she asked why I even want to try medication. I discovered after the fact that she wrote in my chart that I ""have no problem sitting still and staying on task when unmedicated."" Apparently she misunderstood and thought I only have ADHD symptoms when on name brand Adderall???? I think she thinks I'm just seeking, which I get that that's a problem, but she literally has the paperwork to talk to my therapist who did the diagnosis and hasn't reached out at all, even after making a big deal about getting it. o clearly she doesn't actually care to know whether I am. have an appointment in just under two weeks and I'm going to go through my chart with her and correct all the inaccuracies, (she also has in my chart that I'm primarily seeking treatment to handle pandemic related stress which.... no.) and then probably just tell her what I think we should try next. But I am so freaking tired of pretty much having to be my own doctor. Our last appointment made it clear that I am leaps and bounds better informed than her on ADHD and especially ADHD medication and I don't want to be. I don't want to have to dig into all this research on ADHD meds bc my doctor doesn't have a clue.  I'm frustrated and tired of trying medications that don't work and not being listened to and having to be my own doctor, but my med manager lacks the education and experience to actually help me and doesn't even believe I have ADHD, despite a formal diagnosis.kind of running out of hope I'll ever find a med/solution/or even just a doctor that works",1635096969,5265,987

ADHD,"I’ll give some personal examples: I’m dating also had adhd and he interrupts me like 10 times in a sentence so it takes me an hour to finish my story and it drives me nuts. I lose my entire train of thought every time I have to stop and answer. I know he doesn’t intend to be rude and we discussed it but I wish he would save his questions for the end  on tiktok speaking so erratically it literally feels like I’m on a rollercoaster ride. Drives me way nuts. 🥜 When asked about why she was talking like that, she said all adhd people talk like that. I commented that I have adhd but can logically tell a story and edit out thoughts that are unimportant, not everyone with adhd definitively does that. he said that means I don’t actually have adhd if i don’t speak that way 🤦‍♀️Any of you find yourself getting unintentionally irritated with others who also have adhd?",1635096450,868,164
ADHD,"Been on generic Addy for 7 months. First month I was on 5 mg twice a day. Then I needed an increase about 5 weeks later.  I'm on 15 mg a day but take 20 mg at least twice a week when I need it to last longer or feel more ""potent"". My fear is that I'll need to constantly increase it to feel the benefits.

ADHD,"I got diagnosed 2 weeks ago and I was prescribed Adderall. At first it was 20mg XR just to try it out, it helped so much but it just doesn't last as long as I need it to, hardly any effect on me, and the minimal effect wears off after about 4 hours. My dosage got upped to 30mg (highest I can get) in the first week of trying this out because of that (I was supposed to get another prescription to 10mg IR but they never prescribed it after our meeting, I haven't had the chance to talk to them either), it kind of worked the first day or two but after that no. I cannot feel much if anything at all, my focus just isn't there.  I'd like the effect of these stimulants to last around 10-12 hours. I'm interested in Vyvanse because I heard it has the same effect, just lasts longer. I asked about it and the only issue is I don't have insurance, the only reason I could get XR is because there's substitutes ($44 per 30 and it's exactly the same thing) which I guess Vyvanse doesn't have? That's what I was told at least. I can't pay for insurance atm and personally I'd never want to start.. is there any alternatives? I'm pretty scared to post this because I feel like there's no other alternatives that I can get or maybe medication won't help me. Maybe I'm too fucked up to have any sort of meds help me the way I need it to. Just feel helpless I guess.  if anyone has any kind of idea about prices without insurance or how to make my dose give me the effect I need or last a bit longer, please let me know. to all for reading and taking time out of your day.Adderall not lasting long enough for me",1635096313,1601,315

ADHD,"Hi Everyone, In summary; one specialist said I don’t have ADHD, four years later a second specialist says I do have it: I’m 33F work in molecular biology.  few years ago I had a really bad year, too much school, work, personal stuff all at once, was super overwhelmed with life and exhausted all the time, but my reaction to it had me suspecting I had ADHD. I knew a lot of people with the same pressure who handled it much different than me. All the criteria of ADHD fit me like a glove. I got a professional evaluation (5 session) with a specialist [though her practice does not mention specializing in ADHD, but my psychiatrist at the time told me she’s the best in the field]. The specialist determined that I did not have ADHD, her analysis showed that I had a slightly below to general IQ (97-105)but high IQ in some areas, and incredibly slow processing speed (78). Keep in mind I was also diagnosed with depression and was extremely extremely sleep deprived, which she did not factor into her analysis. This blew my mind, my whole life I was really good in TEM just slow to hear and remember information, it didn’t make sense to me! forward 4 years later, TikTok is blowing up and I get hooked on all these videos about ADHD. o many characteristics people talk about that I didn’t know where related to ADHD were exactly what have been facing in my everyday life, o. Many. Things! I went out to get a second opinion, this time from a therapist specifically specialized in adult ADHD, he immediately came to the conclusion that I have it, but he carried out his four evaluation sessions with me to confirm the degree and type.My husband doesn’t believe I have it which is frustrating and makes me question myself. (Don’t hate on him, he’s the sweetest person alive, he just sees things differently than I do).My question is: if you were me would you get a third opinion? Evaluations are expensive and time consuming but I’m afraid of being one of the over or under diagnosed people? Who is wrong? The second specialist could be over diagnosing people but the first specialist could be not well informed! Urrrrg Thanks!One specialist said I don’t have ADHD and the other said I do have it. Would you get a third tie breaker evaluation if you were me?",1635094533,2256,408

ADHD,"(Very long depressing story about being a worthless person. Attempt at a Tl;dr below)  is an old post I have posted before but I feel like I'm feeling useless again. I won't even read my own comment because it's long and I feel stupid reading my own words that are pouring out of my depressive rut... If you don't want to read all of it, I 100% don't blame you. I've added one new paragraph just to add something. Anyways, thank you for even giving your time out of your day to read one word of this) basically show my whole situation even though it's embarrassing. I'm 24(M). I have an Asian tiger mom who wants to put education above all else. With possible undiagnosed ADHD, my whole life I've been doing nothing but procrastinating, having no motivation, always screwing up in the class room, forgetting everything, etc (basically ADHD things). I was doing College and I did pretty bad the first semester and it plummeted my GPA badly. I ended up meeting my first ever girlfriend during my first semester. I started spending. A lot of time with her and at her family's house to which I kind of just moved in rent free. I feel incredibly guilty about this and everyday I think about how I'm nothing but a pathetic leech and I'm literally providing nothing. I help her family with their business and they work a couple of hours a day an. I make some money along with my GF. I ended up taking Online classes because I always hated going to Campus and sitting there for an hour or two when I forget everything anyways. I always try taking notes but they need stick in my head and everything a teacher says immediately dissipates from my mind. I started taking online classes. They allowed me to have much more free time and I just do quizzes, tests, or assignments every week. I would alway drop out of classes that had teachers that wanted a ton of work to be done every week that seemed insane. As I took more and more online classes and bettered my GPA, the online classes at my school started to dwindle and I would only take one or two online classes a semester. Getting the motivation to drive there and drive back while waiting there bored out of my mind when I know I won't retain anything was making me feel terrible.  on Facebook makes me feel like an utter failure. I see people with actual jobs and graduated while I still haven't graduated and I couldn't even hold down fast food jobs mainly because of some back problems and overall procrastination laziness. I hate it. I would love to work in something that I actual want to work in like writing but that's a no go**** (added extra paragraph in post) missed being the early freshman where I lived at the dorm and I wanted to walk to class, even if I still went absent for some days because I just didn't feel like it. I may have done bad but being away for the first time made me want to go.  never had a job before going away to college either. My first job was as a busser for an entertainment company. I was actually excited and I would clean tables quickly and efficiently. Even the management said they liked how quick I was. Problems eventually arose as there were ZERO breaks. I would work 7-9 hours with zero breaks and my back would literally be hurting very bad. It was so bad that my back almost gave out and I almost fell. I haven't seen a doctor for it (since I'm a pansy baby) but in middle school I was diagnosed as having some level of scoliosis so it may have gotten worse. My mom always told me it will get better and it never did.  gave out, I was already a lazy, procrastinating, possibly ADHD riddled mess but now, I just hated working. I hated standing there when all the tables were done and just messing with a fidget cube because I couldn't stand still. I hated all the coworkers who were just lounging around and I did most of the work in our crew. I hated how I couldn't talk to my GF for a few minutes while she was there but my boss who scolded me could talk for hours to her husband about meaningless stuff. Most of all, I hated seeing my family visit me there and seeing how miserable I was. I just broke and ended up crying so much.  ended up quitting and got a new job at a food place in the Mall. I couldn't work the cash register since I couldn't remember how to work it. My social anxiety kicked in when talking to customers to where I would be shaking intensively in my boots. My social anxiety can get so bad where I forget everything. One time, I auditioned for a music group and I had the whole song in my head. I usually love performing in front of people but there were only two people and a camera without any background music. I froze and couldn't remember the first word of the damn song...  still had back pain and I always felt inclined to not go and hang out with my GF who I don't feel awkward with and I feel like I can be myself. I would have some sort of excuse for work and I feel bad because I bailed and I wouldn't go because not only did the possible ADHD kick in, but the unwillingness to do anything that seemed like work since I just felt empty doing it.  stopped working jobs and just started working with my GFs family. It's an easy job and I get to be with my GF the whole time.  for getting side tracked.)  I ended up getting in a mess with my parent's tax returns and I couldn't go to college this year. Prior to that, I always told my parents I may graduate next year but it didn't come and I just kept lying because I probably have some parents problems stemming from my mom. he raised me and my siblings for the most part. he would always get angry pretty easily and I was physically disciplined a lot as a child. I was extensively scared of her and I lied a lot to get out of trouble. Now, I'm scared of her and I feel like a failure and I know telling her would make her more angry and she would probably take the car she got for me in High chool away.  lying to my GFs family too. I said I was a senior when I'm definitely not as this point. I didn't go to school this year because of our accountant messing up on the tax returns (because our accountant said my mom and her boyfriend were married when they weren't) but I still said I was going to school since I was afraid of working again  (as well as the usual lack of motivation, anxiety about everything, scared of messing up, etc) after all of those bad experiences.  a mess. I have no idea what to do with my life. I have terrible time blindness and these past few years flew by and I don't even remember a lot of it. I couldn't even remember a combination of numbers (or anything that I needed to memorize right away) but being unable to remember parts of what happened in my life scares me. I'm going to be old and I won't remember a damn thing and if my wife dies, I will just be alone and can barely remember a thing.  only chose my major cause I needed one. I have bad social anxiety but I still changed my degree to Public Relations because of how much time I spend on social medias like YouTube or Reddit. I know about companies that screw up on their PR and I've always thought they need to be on the good side of the public. ""Any press is good press"" is certainly something I do not agree with as bad press will cause your downfall unless you're a rare YouTuber that isn't affected by it.  I changed my degree, I wanted to be a game designer but programming ended up being too hard for me.  tried learning instruments or video editing but it always ends up in - Do you have motivation? Usually no but if yes, can you even focus on it? If yes, can you even remember it? Oh good! You remember it? Well that's only because of repetitive muscle memory and you didn't actually learn anything.  test? I only memorize that specific problem's work around when looking over a study sheet. When the test arrives, there are problems that throw a curve ball and I'm completely lost.  pathetic and suck at everything. The only good things I'm good or decent at are typing (hence why I just ramble and post long stuff), singing/rapping, and video games. I've also been told I'm good at acting but I'm Asian and Asians rarely get any parts in movies or TV hows.  each skills I always found a negative aspect.  Entry for typing? The jobs are diminishing because of AI and those jobs are few and far between  Music? I would honestly LOVE to do this one. It makes my social anxiety go away in most cases. It makes me feel good. I've gotten compliments. It makes my ADHD go away since memorizing songs are much easier and I'm able to move around instead of just standing still so it's much more viable than giving a presentation. Let's be honest though. Being a musician that makes money is a pipe dream and wouldn't come true. I don't even care about being mega rich and I would just love to make a decent living off of music but nope. ome people have said to learn music production but the same thing happens (lack of motivation, focus, memory, etc). I usually try and watch videos to learn specific stuff and I doze out, watch then forget, or just give up and put it off. (I'm also not a good song writer but I can write decent stuff).  I know this is a weird thing to add but I've been told I look like a celebrity/famous person and some people said I should since I've got the looks and decent talent but with the pandemic going on and making money off of music being a rarity in general, I don't think it really matters)  games? I'm good at games but nowhere near enough to make money off of them  Hell, decent jobs in general seem so hard to get even if I were actively trying to find one, there are so many other people doing the same thing. They have more experience and talent than me (as well as being normal) so why would a recruiter even pick me?  described my experience yesterday where I finally applied for 5-7 ( I forgot how many ) internships that look hours on end because a variety of problems. (uch as the websites being buggy, I had to make multiple accounts for each job position aka I had to put down my job history, information, etc multiple times. Made my resume off of a resume builder site and after putting a ton of work into it, the site tried making me pay a monthly fee when it came off as free. It should at least tell you that in order to make one, you need to pay). I didn't even have the gall to do it. I tried forcing myself and it was awful but I ended up doing it even though I know I won't be accepted.  forget most of the things I put off. I tried writing in my notes of anything I have to do but there are O many things I put off that it gets lost in the sea of notes even if I wanted to do it. Even now, I'm writing this in my notes and I'm writing small sentences to make sure I don't forget what I'm going to say next.  focus is a thing for me and I only wish I could apply it to things I want to learn. I have to be fully interested in something to even enjoy knowing something new that I can apply which is usually in video games.  you can't tell, it seems like I enjoy things that usually keep my body or mainly hands busy but that may just be a coincidence. if I had to pick out a dream route of how my life would actually get better it would start off like this.   Make music and get decently noticed to where I have a fan base. I would love to make a clothing line and work with a person who can draw to make merchandise that people want to wear. I see many celebrities make clothes that are too odd and don't stand out from the crowd or are terrible looking. I would want something that people would wear continuously while also promoting your brand.  omeone asks where someone else got their hoodie or shirt to where it ends up in a conversation about music tastes which will introduce the other person into that specific person's music)  the decent popularity, that would improve my chances into getting into acting. I would love to try and voice act. Asians get more roles in voice acting and there are a number of exquisite roles that are more exciting. I would also try and get side acting roles. I know I wouldn't get major roles but I'm fine with portraying side characters.  would LOVE to write stories for shows or movies. Not by myself but with a team since I bounce off of ideas because I suck at creating them. This would be amazing but these writing gigs are usually for people who network or those who have a ton of experience in writing shows. I doubt I could even get a spot on a creative writing team.  know people will say go into journalism but I can only write a lot about things I care about. I wrote this whole paper on my experience during college but it's hard to write on paper for college which is ironic.)  enough money, I would love to open a business that could have some fall backs in case it doesn't work out. I don't know what it would be but I know I want to dabble in something.  just a route that I would like but I know it wouldn't come true.  a minute there I actually became somewhat happy when writing all of that down. I forgot that I wasn't a f*ck up that has no value in this world and all I'm doing is leeching off of those who are too good to me and I hate it.  just feel miserable and as a as I want to see a professional, they are incredibly expensive.  a liar, I'm stupid, I'm a sloth, I'm worthless, I'm a leech, and I'm just pathetic.  have thoughts about ending my life but no one has to worry about that because of course, I'm also a scared wuss. I'm scared of dying, scared of needles, scared of the dark, scared of heights, scared of customers, scared of literally many things.  room with my GF's family has a ton of unwashed clothes piled everywhere. Along with being unorganized I don't have room to put them so in my mind it makes me feel justified that I don't get them done and that includes a lot of my home life stuff that normal people get done easily or right away.  not even mentioning my self esteem issues and even when many people compliment my looks, I am very insecure especially after some negative comments by only a few people about either my nose looking like a certain ethnicity or my acne scars. (Negative comments stay with me for a long time)  just have so many things wrong with me and the thing is, as awesome as it is to see people like me in the ADHD ub Reddit. There are posts who talk about being successful and those who actually persevere while working hard.

My mind is now going blank but I feel like there's a ton I want to say but now I can't remember. I'm just constantly moving my legs up and down while refusing to read my own post because I'm afraid that I sound stupid and it's way too long.  mean, I can't even read a long passage without skimming through it or forgetting it so my post isn't any special.

Did bad at first semester of college then slowly started going to Online chooling since because of usual ADHD problems as well as getting ready, driving there, staying in a class room for hours when I forget everything a teacher says even when writing notes, then driving back made me apprehensive. Online classes were dwindling and I started taking lesser classes and well as dropping out of them. Lied to them about college since I had two terrible experiences with working and my ADHD is gotten worse to where I can't get motivation to go. Can't learn anything because of lack motivation, focus, and I can't remember basic things (or to even do them). Lied to my Asian tiger mom because I'm scared of her as she gets angry really easily and I was physically disciplined by her a lot. I got other things like self esteem issues, social anxiety, generalized anxiety, and I'm scared of a ton of things. I suck at everything and the only things I am good at don't make a career path. I don't even know what to do in life and I only chose my major out of desperation. I want to learn new things but ADHD is making it incredibly difficult. Can't go to a professional since it's expensive and I've tried doing and researching various ADHD methods of help.  know I left out a ton of stuff but that's my best effort without reading my long post since I'll just skim through it or doze off.

ADHD,"   all. till kinda-fairly new to Reddit (first time posting, actually). Guess I wanted to try digging into this community, for various reasons. my 40s, was finally diagnosed with ADHD about 11 years ago but I suspected I had it much earlier than that just by reading up on the symptoms. Inability to finish tasks, losing focus during conversations, teeth clenching, wrist popping, finding it impossible to read a book if people are around let alone talking? All me. Almost held back a grade because I couldn’t pay attention in school? That too. from friends can grow when you find it difficult to make that call or respond to that text or email. I know all about that. I got married but would often find it so difficult to just sit with her or relatives. By the time I was officially diagnosed, and felt the euphoria of it explaining everything in my life, my wife and I were well into discussions of divorce. By then the damage had already been done, on both of our sides. thing is, and has always been, the hyper focus and the inevitable decline of interest. hort stories? 90% of them are half-written. Video editing? Made some progress there but still have so much raw material. Epic storylines race through my head, with a definitive beginning and a cathartic ending, but I never get around to putting pencil to paper. Each little project I start I give 210% to it until it drops quickly to 0%. with Reddit. LOOK AT ALL THEE UB-REDDIT. O MANY THING I’M INTERETED IN. OOO, THEY HAVE ONE FOR THI? HAHA, WHAT A FUNNY VIDEO. LET ME REPOND TO THAT WHAT’ THI OVER HERE OH LOOK AT THAT POT WAIT LET ME FINIH THI FIRT WOW THAT’ PRETTY GOOD LET ME JUT WHAT’ THAT OVER THERE HAHA LOOK AT ME I’M COMMENTING OH JUT GOT ANOTHER But even after two weeks in I can already feel the inevitable decline. Even here. ometimes I find myself scrolling through so fast that I barely have time to read the post headings, like I’m just trying to get to an endless ending. And I think to myself, is this it? Is this all there is? don’t want it to be. Not in this community, anyway, in which, for the first time in my life, I’m seeing so many other people, thousands of other people, that know what it’s like. When I was a kid I didn’t know what this was. When I became an adult I didn’t really know anyone that could relate to what it is. Until now. Here I am. Making an attempt to be a part of something. Having that conversation. upporting supporters. And hoping that at least with this it doesn’t have to be 210% and it doesn’t have to be 0%. Maybe, just maybe, it can finally, for once, be something somewhere in the middle. Hi.The Gulf Between All or Nothing",1635091809,2641,492
ADHD,"Hey there! Im a bit new to all of this so excuse me. My boyfriend of 4 years was diagnosed with ADD (I know ADD and ADHD are separate in some way, he may have been diagnosed with ADHD but I can not remember properly, im super sorry) in high school. We've moved in together about a year ago, and I didn't realise how bad he was. No motivation, no focus, he just has difficulty doing the simplest things. Im not one to talk about his symptoms, but ive strongly encouraged him to seek therapy again for it after failing his classes three times in a row. After giving him a few months to make appointments himself, and getting nothing but answering machines and no call backs, he broke down and said he couldn't, and asked me to do it for him. His old therapist is no longer in practice, and its been ages since hes seen a primary care provider. We need a referral to see someone, but im not quite sure where to get that for him. Hed be going to the appointments and everything else himself, and making follow ups, its just that initial getting everything settled that is overwhelming him and hes asked me for help about.  that same note, what can I do for him? I want to be supportive, but I don't quite know what to say. He feels really bad about me having to ""deal"" with him and tucks his emotions away because i have my own problems to deal with too, but I really don't see an issue with it. I just want to be a supportive girlfriend with him, and i know things are harder for him so i don't want to say something like ""just stay motivated :)"" or whatever because you don't just tell someone with depression to ""just be happy"".  just lost with the whole thing entirely. He's mentioned his diagnosis before to me, but i didn't think anything of it. Its now that I live with him that i see how bad it is, but I just Don't know how to be supportive to something like this.  also sorry for the throw away account, friends and family follow my main and I don't think its right to tell people close to us about this without his knowledge.Hey all, I'm sorry if I'm in the wrong place, I'm not quite sure what to do.

His Dr put him on a second medicine to counter act the tics. It works some but not spectacular.

ADHD,"I was recently diagnosed with ADHD and medicated for the first time in my life and it’s been nothing short of incredible. I knew I had ADHD for a while now, but it wasn’t until this last week I realized just how MUCH it has damaged in my life. It has cost me jobs, years of education, relationships, money, and so much more.  control has always been incredibly difficult for me my whole life. I’ve had trouble with spending money, flirting, saying things I don’t really mean, and more. I didn’t understand why I struggled to control it so much. I didn’t even realize how badly it interacted with childhood traumas I have either; I’ve been a people pleaser for as long as I can remember because of the trauma and it’s something that’s made me crave some form of validation as a dopamine fix that only got worse with time, and it played absolute havoc with my rejection sensitivity. If I wasn’t pleasing someone I was terrified they would reject me in some way, so I did whatever I could to keep them happy. This mixed with my poor impulse control led to a lot of aggressive flirting with people so I could get some form of acceptance, and it would always escalate so I wouldn’t disappoint them. This never led to physical cheating, but it did lead to a lot of crossed boundaries in my personal life and emotional cheating. I was always ashamed and felt immense remorse when it happened, even if no one else knew. It felt almost entirely uncontrollable for me. Almost like an addiction but not quite?  this has played hell with some of my relationships and ability to maintain some friendships. It was always something I really struggled to control and it’s always made me feel like I was an awful person. It’s only recently that I realized it was a dopamine response. It took me being medicated to see it because now I find it alarmingly easy to just say no to those impulses. I’m finding it a lot easier to process my emotions and calmly approach things I was wanting a fix for…I just feel a lot more stable now.  dunno, I’m feeling a lot of remorse and guilt knowing I should have been medicated a lot sooner. I could have avoided hurting a lot of people in my life. Finally being medicated allowed me to recognize that my impulse was feeding a trauma, and now I know how to say no to that impulse so I can work on said trauma.  just really sucks it took hurting people to get where I’m at now so I can get better.Poor Impulse Control Made My Life Hell Because Of How It Interacted With Trauma",1635091208,2494,462
ADHD,"Hello, I am 24 (I live in Austria, Europe for context) and been diagnosed with ADHD by my therapist (I dont have anything official on paper saying that though) about 4 months ago. was the one mentioning the possibility of me having ADHD after having the YouTube video by Lex Morningstar about ADHD misdiagnosis in women recommended to me on the YouTube app. Before that, Ive never even thought of me having anything to do with ADHD. No one in my family has it (at least not again officially on paper).  also was diagnosed by her with hypersensitivity again after I got a video recommended by YouTube about that topic(I think YouTube knows me better than my therapist ... Which is kinda funny and scary at the same time......) two topics were never discussed before me mentioning them. hes been my therapist for almost 8 to 9 years (with a 2 year break or so) and Ive been going to her for manily depression and anxiety issues (which I know now might be related to me having ADHD). Apparently her method of therapy trying to realize everything yourself and shes there to guide you by me talking about my problems and her correcting me if I get a wrong idea.  I was diagnosed by her I asked her if I needed an official diagnosis on paper by a psychologist or anything similar. he told me that since Im an adult at 24 I dont really need that paper because Im already out of school and thats what official diagnosis are normally for and also that having an official diagnosis might make my life a little harder when for example getting my drivers license (she told me that people with ADHD need to sometimes redo the driving part of the driver license exam every 3 or 4 years to keep their drivers license and proof theyre capable of driving safely) he really strongly discouraged me from getting anything offical and thinks having me know I have ADHD alone is enough for establishing an order in my life and listen to the advice of others about handling ADHD without needing it to be official.I also asked her if I needed stim medicine or something similar and she also kinda discouraged me from that. now I feel kinda divided. Im so much more in tune with myself after finding out I have ADHD because I dont see myself as a complete failure anymore and just have that info without a black and white diagnosis, but on the other hand I kinda want to have anything official saying it and also maybe try meds to see if it helps at least a little. would love to get some advise on that since Im really torn myself about thr whole thing. for the long post and if I made it sound weird, but its hard to explain that whole situation in one post. I also hope you kinda get the gist of my post since English is not my first language and I still struggle with grammar and other things.If something is unclear, please ask right away! you for your help in advance and greetings to you all! ☺Do I need an official ADHD diagnosis at 24?

I'm not a native English speaker, and I'm very new to the adhd diagnosis, so if I'm disrespectful in anyway, please let me know so I don't make this mistake ever again. just had an episode which was very recurrent over my life, but I could never understand until I got my diagnosis. I get bored very easily, as you can imagine, and sometimes this boredom is so overwhelming and unbearable I can only cry it off. ometimes these episodes are coupled with anxiety attacks. I just had one of those in front of two neurotypical friends, and I tried explaining it to them, but of course they didn't get it. I don't blame them, it's hard for me to get how they DON'T feel like this too.  I felt that excruciating boredom, all I could think about was how much I feel dislocated and different. I have other issues, too, which involve feeling like I shouldn't have been born, and those arose quite fast as well. I was a mess, and the boredom would not wear out, so I just couldn't stop crying and feeling pathetic, and the fact that I've worked every single day without rest for the past 7 years and have to work today too only made it worse.  that the episode is mostly over, I feel extremely ashamed, even though they were not disrespectful to me in any way while I was crying (they mostly let me do my thing while observing from afar after they understood what was happening). I have no idea how to face my friends again or engage in conversation with them. I feel like they think I'm stupid, pathetic, childish or something like that. The shame I'm feeling at the moment is as unbearable as the boredom, and I feel so inadequate I would rather starve at the balcony (where I'm at) rather than go inside to eat, just because they would see me and remember I'm here. I feel terrible, and I know this will happen again in the future, so I can't help but feeling like a permanent nuisance. don't really hope anyone will have an answer or any advice to give me, I just wanted to talk it out and have a little support maybe?
